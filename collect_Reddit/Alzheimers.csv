Alzheimers,Are there FMT treatments or trials available in the US?,"My mother is rapidly declining and I’m extremely frustrated that despite all the recent evidence that FMT could be an incredibly effective treatment, it’s not being made available or being promoted. Does anyone have more information on this?

[2021 case report of 90 y/o woman post CDI treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34289768/)","Unfortunately, no treatments are cures and none can reverse the course of the disease. Some may prolong life or make the progression stop for a small amount of time. While FMT may be promising for some, there just isn’t enough evidence to have it be a common treatment yet.
Could you link to this evidence?",2022-05-16 12:01:55,jettisonthelunchroom,uqza1u
Alzheimers,What stage is Mom at when she can't remember that she lives in her home?,"She gets freaked out and tells the people who work at her senior living place that she needs them to call me to come get her and starts crying because she thinks she doesn't live there. She's lived there for 4 years. After a while she'll settle into her apartment and everything will be ok. I'm just wondering at what point will she start wandering, because that's the day they say she has to go to memory care.","My mom had lived in the same home for 50 years and started not recognizing it. ""I want to go home"" is a frequent cry you'll hear. With my mom, it also started in with her insisting a neighbor was trying to kill her. She was incredibly descriptive, complete with the size and color of the gun. At that point, we had to move her to a place where they knew what to do, as we were beyond knowing how to help and we couldn't quit jobs at this age. She thrived in the memory care community as they had the training and skill we lacked.
So when they say she'll have to go into memory care when she begins to wander doesn't mean they will be able to keep her if she never ends up wandering away. Basically in regular senior living, residents can come and go as they please. If your mother were to begin wandering, they don't want to be held liable if she walks out the door and no one can find her. Memory care wards all have locks on the doors that don't allow residents to leave without a caregiver present.

While senior living will help assist with small tasks and care throughout the day, the person is still fairly autonomous in their day to day functioning. If she begins to no longer be able to remember things like brushing her teeth, how and when to shower, if she ate, stops changing her clothes... etc. that is when the discussion of memory care will really become prevalent. 

We tried to keep my dad in his house as long as we could because we were afraid of a downward spike, but at the end of the day it comes down to what caregivers can handle.",2022-05-16 00:10:50,Missmoneysterling,uqnbl9
Alzheimers,What can I do to help my girlfriend deal with her father's Alzheimer's?,"Hello! My girlfriends dad has Alzheimer's. It's a stage where he has just now been moved to a full time care taking facility. He got moved there last week, and she just visited him there for the first time. Some people in her family keeps telling her, that she isn't doing enough. Which is not okay in my eyes.
Obviously she is very affected, and especially because he keeps asking to come home again, which breaks her heart and in turn mine.
And so, i was just wondering if you guys have any advice for me, as to how i can really support her in this, because it's a little hard for me to really understand her feelings, since I've never been in that situation.
And if you have advice i could bring her that might have helped some of you guys cope?

Thanks alot, and i wish you all the best of luck through your difficult times.","If the family says she isn't doing enough, she can say she agrees and could really use their help on following up on their suggestions. Whatever they think she needs to do, that's what she needs their help on: they can do it!

Only the person in charge of providing care knows what the person receiving care really needs. For example, even my husband, who lived with me and my dementia-having mother, was somehow unaware of the real and practical ways I needed to provide care for my mom. Unless you are doing it, you can't know, and everyone will do it differently. So she will always get well-meaning, clueless advice from her family. But she doesn't need advice: they can do what they believe is necessary, if they want, but they can't expect her to do what they think is needed because she is doing what she thinks is needed. 

Please support her, back her up, and let her know that she's in charge and her decisions are the right ones in the moment with the information that she has.
I would say just be there for her; listen to her, let her vent/cry to you, give her lots of hugs (if she wants them). It is so incredibly sad and challenging so having an understanding partner is crucial.
My favorite go-to answer about going home is whenever the doctors say it’s okay- you push it on to a doctor, then they usually forget about following up with a doctor. I think it helps keep tension from building. Go visit as much as she wants, when/if it’s feasible take him out on short trips. If there were simple activities he enjoyed, try to do some of those. Actually “working” can be very rewarding, so even raking leaves or washing windows.
Validate her feelings. Alzheimer’s is a horrible disease for the caregivers and family especially. Watching a parent go through it is extremely difficult. The good thing is, he is in a place where he is safe and taken care of by staff who are trained to assist with his daily needs and wants. She has a life too, and guilt is a really nasty monster to deal with especially when you’re trying to be the best for yourself and your parent at the same time. Just keep listening and understanding her. It means more than you know.
Listen and encourage. I bet I read my husband the stage six symptoms a hundred times trying to decide what I needed to do to help my Mother. It means a lot to know he listened as I was trying to make sense of everything. 

As time passes and she gets really mentally and physically exhausted, do something to give her a break. The disease is cruel and lasts a long time.
I think all AD patients want to go home. My husband wants to go home even though he is in his own home of 20 years. I believe they want to escape the unknown thoughts of their minds and go to a place from childhood where they can be themselves again And feel some comfort. I haven’t placed my spouse in a home yet , but did go through this with mom who had frontal lobe dementia. There is no way we could give her the 24/7 care she needed. i live out of town so couldn’t visit often. My brother however said he would visit for 10 minutes or so then leave for 5 minutes and come back , she would act like the first time she saw him , she never remembered the visit just a few minutes ago. So let her know her dad wont remember a whole lot and she should not feel guilty if she can’t visit more often. I’m sure she is doing her best and it sounds like she has a good support  person in you.",2022-05-16 05:01:00,ratchetnotclank,uqrif0
Alzheimers,normal to not be allowed to see her?,"Is this normal?  At first we weren't allowed to because of covid and so she could get settled, but then it was because she wouldn't remember us and would upset her?  She's already passed, but this bothers me still.","I don't think a memory care unit could make the call that you're not allowed to visit because it would upset her. Sorry for your loss.
That is definitely not normal. I'd be immediately suspicious something was wrong.
They can advise you not to visit, but they can't force you unless it is a safety or health issue.
I think it depends. We were not flat out told we couldn't, but my mom's agitation greatly increased after a visit with us. When we would start making moves to leave, she would start hitting. After her leaving, I could watch on video footage how bad it got for the nurses and aides. Plus, my mom would end up injuring herself if she fell while trying to swing at someone. Their asking us not to visit was for their safety, and I understood that. You can ask if they have cameras that you can watch to see how she's acting that has them concerned.",2022-05-15 21:22:23,TealedLeaf,uqke6q

Just remember most the person she was before the Alz took over. With my Mom, the sweetness came and went at times but just being as kind as poss and taking breaks when you can is helpful.

Alzheimers,"need help. My mom's(56) got it. She is too young. And Im really sad. I can get distracted as I work too hard all week. But now and then I remember how terrible the situation is. Also my dad is sad. I found him crying, he told me he wishes mom was healthy. Need adviece on how to cope.",,"All I can say is that it is OK, even good, to go through this stage of grieving. It IS sad, a tragedy. You and your dad and whoever else is close with your mom will have to grieve. That stage won’t last as intensely forever. You will reach the stage of acceptance. Of course you’ll have moments of grief later too, but overall you’ll be more focused on the logistics of caring for your mom and giving her the best quality of life possible. Grieve now so that you can thrive later.
Lots of resources here: https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/caregiver-health/caregiver-stress
So very sorry, that's so sad.   You & dad ought to go to some alzheimers or dementia org support groups, or even the offices, for counselling, if there are no support groups in yr area.  Alzhms & dementia orgs have tons of resources, literature, counselling / therapy, tips & tactics how to help & support those living with memory-loss issues & their family/friends/carers live productive happy lives as much as possible.   best of luck!
My mom is a little older than yours, but we are also grieving as she has been getting a lot worse this year. I just wanted to let you know that you’re not alone in this. It’s really hard and I find myself crying and being distracted while trying to work all the time.
It’s sad to say, but there are plenty of people who have been exactly where you are right now. There are things you’re going to have to figure out- proper care, handling finances, her living situation, etc- it can feel overwhelming, and that’s fine.

Tackle one thing at a time when it comes to the stuff you have to get done for her. Did she pay the bills? Grab one bill right now and set up autopay. Did she do the grocery shopping? Set up a plan for that. Next week, tackle something else. Every one of these day to day things you can get done should give you more of a sense that you can handle that aspect of things. 

Most importantly, don’t forget to take care of yourself- you need to make this a priority, since your mom will benefit the most from having you at your best. DO NOT ignore your own happiness- spoil yourself and get selfish when you can with your happiness, and watch out for depression- therapy definitely helps. 

One thing my therapist said that stuck with me when I told her I just wanted to be happy again- it would actually be abnormal for someone to be happy while first dealing with this. Keep that in mind- you will be happy, but maybe not right now. It’s going to take some adjusting, and some time to get used to- this disease does not get better, it only gets worse- but you can adjust with it, just tackle one thing at a time, and take care of yourself",2022-05-15 02:18:20,Edyjjjj,upzuf5
Alzheimers,Try to give a loved one independence or wrap them in bubble wrap?,"My grandfather was in the navy, he was known as
onion for his tendency to make other men cry. I'm
visiting my grandparents for the first time in years
and he needed help finding the light switch in his
own home to go upstairs to bed. I showed him
where but he turned it on and then off so I told him
""you hit it twice"" and he replied ""just fix it""

I’ve known how bad it can be for a while but now it's
really hitting me hard. I need to fly back in a
couple weeks and leave my poor old grandma to
help him all on her own. First I've cried in
years, because sure I'd be sad if anything happened
to my parents, the difference is that my
grandparents are kind hearted pure people who took me in for a crucial couple of years that turned my life around. My mother was negligent and by grade 4 I couldn’t read or write, I didn’t even know left from right, literally.

My nan shouldn’t have to start nursing again at her age but she’s convinced pop wouldn’t be happy without her care. Caring for him is so demanding but she wouldn’t hear a bar of putting him into someone else’s care, even brought up the plot of The Leisure Seeker to me 😂 I guess she can relate to that movie but of course wouldn’t do that","Oh, that's sad for y'all, it's tough.   
Research for yr grandparents area Alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org what options they might have for support services / respite they could access.   You're right that it will be increasingly difficult for your gran to manage, it's a very difficult 24/7 job caring for the memory lossed, and the carers often don't / can't admit or accept they need help.    
You very well will have to use creative persuasion tactics to get them to accept / access some in-home care visits or whatever.  All the oldies insist they don't need help.  Or maybe ask at some local legit good-people church groups, if they run any programs or services, if that might be an option.    
You yourself also can access alzhms / dementia org for counselling, and all sorts of information pertaining to all aspects of memory-loss conditions.   Good on you for wanting to help them!   This is absolutely the time to get that stuff organised, as the persons themselves often don't go there until some accidents or burn-outs happen.  Be tenacious & persuasive!   good luck!
Personally I would make the sacrifice to help them or at least be near, but I understand that not everyone can do that financially, mentally or physically. This *is* the end of life, make them comfortable and enjoy your moments together, no matter how fleeting.
It’s a balancing act. We tried to do whatever we could to automate things like motion sensor lights, and lights on timers since they were a struggle. We put signs on other things to help orient as well so that we didn’t have to intercede and they didn’t have to struggle.  It’s not easy to watch someone you love disappear before your eyes - there is no shame in crying.
They'd probably do well in a shared apartment in assisted living.  There wouldn't be any stairs.  Help would be available if needed.  They would still have each other.  Have you considered anything like that?",2022-05-14 10:54:53,goobs420,upiwva
Alzheimers,UK BASED EXPERIENCE WITH DVLA/NHS AFTER DIAGNOSIS,"My dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimers in December 2021 after memory clinic assessment and review of brain scans from Sept 2021. We informed the DVLA of this in December 2021 and have received a holding letter to apologise for the delay in their reaction to whether it’s okay for my father to continue driving. My mother and I do not feel he is safe to drive, he had an accident in August 2021 which was entirely his fault, his reactions are not what they were and the mobility in his legs is effected (he shuffles a lot and gets cramps in his leg muscles) and we of course we informed the memory clinic nurse of our worries discreetly. As I’m sure is the case with a lot of men in their mid/late seventies who have just received this diagnosis, he says he feels no different at all and gets very defensive when we try to discuss his diagnosis and we think he hasn’t got a full grasp on what his diagnosis means (due to the condition, no doubt). Today, he received a letter from the consultant at the same memory clinic to say that he will be having a telephone assessment (due to Covid) regarding his ability to continue driving. Has this been the case for other people, he is of course going to tell the consultant and the memory clinic that he feels that he is fine to drive?! Does anyone UK based know if this is normal? He was just starting to get used to my mother being the driver and we’re desperately worried that if the NHS/DVLA tell him that he’s okay to continue driving based upon a telephone assessment (HOW CAN THEY MAKE THIS ASSESSMENT ON THE PHONE?) it will become a huge source of conflict if we try to stop him. Any UK based experience similar to this with DVLA/NHS would be greatly appreciated.","Our experience was the DVLA wrote to the consultant and the consultant based on prior meetings with my husband told them he couldn't drive. There was no direct conversation with my husband as part of that process. If you are concerned you can make the consultant aware of things you've witnessed in advance. I think they're pretty used to the reluctance to stop driving as understandably a lot of people see it as their independence being taken away.
None of your doctors have said he should stop driving?  After two of my husband's doctors recommended that, I used their advice as leverage.  Good luck.",2022-05-14 07:41:05,DottieLassen,upfh8u
Alzheimers,Please help a newbie Alzheimer's Caregiver who belongs to a country where no proper medical care is available for this disease.,"It started all of a sudden. My mom passed away on 07.07.2020. Her departure had a great impact on my dad as they were together for 42 years. From 2nd half of 2021 (June or July may be) we started observing some abnormalities like some illogical statements and questions(which were very occasional and unnoticable). But from then we noticed his excessive fascination towards sweet foods including ice creams, cakes, chocolates, candies etc. He has diabetes but he started eating candies and ice creams whenever he went out alone. I talked to the local grocery shop who informed me that Dad on average takes 5 to 10 ice creams daily. I was very annoyed on him because of this childish behavior because till then I didn't realized that he developed something like dementia or Alzheimer's. Things kept going like this till this year. Last week my dad left home in the midnight and when he got back I asked him why he left home and he couldn't answer me and he was very confused. That time I realized something is wrong with him which needs medical attention. Next day I rushed to a neurologist who told me that he has developed dementia and prescribed few medications including Donepezil Hydrochloride INN 5 mg tab once in the night, Quetiapine Fumerate 25 mg 2 tabs in the night and Ginkgo Biloba 60 MG tab twice a day. Since we started The meds he started hallucinating throughout the day. After a couple of days I contracted with the with the doc and he told me to discontinue Donepezil and continue the rest. But till today there is no progress and his deteriorating each day. I'm really confused whether this is because of the meds prescribed or his progressing so fast. Is it really possible to deteriorate within a week??
I have done extensive research for lost couple of days and discovered Alzheimer's is also termed as type 3 diabetes which leads to excessive fascination towards sweet foods because of some chemical imbalance in the brain. My doctor didn't tell me anything like this. Later I came across some researches which shows nasal insulin helps  Alzheimer's patients to some extent. I really want to try that out. Anyone ever tried Nasal insulin for Alzheimer's  or dementia?? I know it is not conclusive or approved yet, but I cannot see my dad suffering without any medical care.","my grandmother is on memantine, i had to increase intake gradually, starting with 1/4 and so on until we hit a whole tablet. 

the quetiapine is a little sus here, why would the doc prescribe an antipsychotic, if there are no such issues (according to your description). it's also not FDA approved for older patients with dementia. 

i would discontinue quetiapine and keep taking donepezil. i would drop the ginko as well, it's not really proven it helps. definitively get a second opinion. 

nasal insulin and [type 3 diabetes](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273\(17\)30791-2) sounds interesting, but it's still in trials, so you are unlikely to be able to do that.  or at least try to search for a trial locally. i also believe you didn't completely understand the implications of type 3 diabetes. 

let's first look at the [mechanics of type 2 diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503727/#:~:text=Type%202%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%20\(T2DM,to%20respond%20appropriately%20to%20insulin.): it's caused by insufficient production of insulin by the pancreas and general resistance of tissues to insulin. the pancreas is usually the bigger factor in type 2, but tissues resistance increases over time. 

in type 3 diabetes (aka alzheimers) the brain tissues develop a resistance to insulin, could be that you develop that resistance just in the brain. type 2 diabetes will generally increase tissue resistance as you live with the disease and it progresses thus increasing your brain cell insulin resistance and impairing their functions. 

we don't know all that much about insulin and brain function, but [it's pretty interesting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4237995/#:~:text=Recent%20work%20suggests%20that%20insulin,and%20memory%20functions%20\(21\).) and getting clearer and clearer how insulin resistance and alzheimers are linked.  

nasal insulin does seem to affect food choice and satiety. but it could be that your dad just always liked sweets, had to cut back because of diabetes and is now losing his inhibitions and control (while also forgetting he already ate; food issues are common in alzies). 

definitively get his diet  and diabetes (impossible, if you don't live with them) under control and proceed from there. 

check for UTIs as well (although not as common in men i guess), sudden drastic changes with alzies could be related to an infection.",2022-05-13 00:13:50,Odd_Economist_8898,uojfbi
Alzheimers,Alz FIL said he wanted to rape me,"My 70yo father-in-law has late-stage Alzheimer’s. He is very fond of me, always asking where I am, when I am going to his house, etc. He’s bedridden for years. Completely lost the ability to take care of himself. 

One day he suddenly told my husband he wanted to rape me (behind my back) and my husband just laughed it off and expected me to do the same, because he thinks he’s delirious and will soon die so we should be lenient. 

While I know he isn’t a threat (not sure if he means what he said though), I still feel disgusted. I told my husband I wouldn’t see him anymore because I simply don’t know what to do or what to feel. Husband feels hurt and upset with me. He thinks it will be a blow to his family. 

Any advice please? :( Really appreciate that!","It's hard to give any real advice, but maybe a different perspective will help. 

Your husband shouldn't have dismissed it, especially in your presence. I understand why he did; arguing with Alzies (is there a more appropriate term?) nevere gets anyone anywhere. 

Alzies often lose the inhibitions that govern normal brains so inappropriate sexual thoughts/advances/touching are completely expected and par for the course (I just realized this is a golf reference).

As I see it, the main issue here is your husband dismissing it (can be talked about), rather than your FIL saying it (which can't be helped).
I’m sorry, that’s a hard place to be. It sounds like there haven’t been issues with him like that when his mind was clearer. 

As vile as it is, please, please remember people in his state don’t work with logic. Their brains literally don’t work. They say and do things they never would have in life, such as swearing and fighting. We tend to want or need some elements of their behavior to be in line with their former selves as they slip away. The fog, however, makes it impossible. Please don’t take it personally. It only gets worse. If you feel unsafe emotionally, I’m so sorry to say this is what it’s like. It is crushing. If you can, look past what you see and hear. Put yourself in his shoes - being helpless with a brain losing its functions. It is a lot like watching an adult turning into an infant. How would you want people to respond to you if you said or did something like that? 

It’s a horrible place to stand and you’re getting the full dose. Try to take some time to recover from his words and try to imagine why his words and actions hold such little meaning.
I would be here a long time, listing all the more egregious behavior that the love of my life has committed lately.

One of her worst highlights - Last year our adult daughter was working from home here, in the house where she grew up in. One night, my wife went out into the front yard and started screaming to the neighbors that my daughter and I were having sex.  She used the most graphic terms you could imagine. My daughter went out and brought her back inside. My wife has accused us of having (graphic) sex numerous times.

Now that our daughter is back in her city. My wife is now repeatedly telling everyone that I am constantly beating her. To the point where I can see doubt creeping into certain family and friends.

My wife is one of the most amazing individuals to have ever walked the face of this earth. My daughter and I know that it is the disease committing these actions and not our wife and mother.
It’s not your father in law speaking, it’s the disease. My mom got super serious with me the other day and told me she was always thinking of how terrible it was for me that my wife and daughter died at such a young age. 

I have no kids, and I’ve never been married. 

It’s tough to hear something like you heard and NOT take it personally- but the brain can be a scary thing when it starts to malfunction.
You may also talk to your husband and let him know how hurtful this is. It sounds like he has a clearer understanding of what’s happening and he may not have shared his thoughts with you, which could be why he laughed. He’s at a different place emotionally. Let him know you want to catch up with him. Seems like he left you behind and he has no idea. Best thing you can do is communicate.
Your FIL has a black mass of dead and dying brain cells in his head.  That's late stage Alzheimer's.  Sections of his brain are dead and dying.

&nbsp;

Try not to be offended by his actions.  

&nbsp;

I feel for ya and I'm sending you much LUV.   I'm just now seeing personality changes in my Mom.  But it's not her fault.  And I'm not focusing on it.  I'm ALL about finding the GOOD right now.
I don’t have any advice, just here to validate your feelings. What a horrible and terrifying thing to hear that someone has said about you. I’m so sorry your husband was dismissive to you, that’s not ok. Your safety is important. Even if he’s not a physical threat, your psychological safety should be cared for and valued, especially by your close loved ones. So sorry this happened and that you’re dealing with this.
My step-father threatened to ""kick the shit out of me"" when we had to sell his car and take away his license. I was upset for a day (I've been the victim of several assaults in my life), then realised this is Alzheimer's at work, not my dad. I'd suggest reading about the condition, as these kinds of outbursts are only going to become more common. Whether you have the empathy to tolerate a symptom of the disease is totally on you.
I’m sorry you had to experience this. 

But if your husband laughed it off, please remind him that it’s not cool, and that the both of you should have a conversation about plans for the future. What are both of your heights and weights? Which person would likely be the caregiver? When would the both of you declare the time when in-home nursing or assisted living is the way to go?
You are entitled to stand your ground on this.
I’m so sorry you and your family are experiencing this. Your FIL is gone. He’s not there anymore and it sounds like your husband and his family haven’t come to grips with that yet. If you decide you’ve said your goodbyes and you want to remember him as he was and not continue contact, that is fine and healthy for you. One of the few silver linings of Alz is that the person who has it wont really remember if you do something that would be emotionally painful to them under normal circumstances. It’s all about soothing their fleeting discomfort. If his behavior is scary to you, you should be able to step away and anyone that chooses to continue visiting or caretaking for him should be able to tell him a little white lie when he asks about you. As long as he is calm and upsetting things he can’t process aren’t being rubbed in he is face constantly, (like your abandonment because of something he did) the only people truly bothered by your decision are your husbands family. If they’re upset then they haven’t fully come to terms with the progression of the disease. FIL won’t be hurt by your decision unless his family shoves it in his face. This whole issue is way less about your FIL actually being able to harm you and you needing to “give him a break” than it is you just being at your limit of watching him deteriorate.",2022-05-13 04:02:36,Affectionate-Fox-911,uomqzi
Alzheimers,Intelligent drug delivery system - asking for advice.,"My grandmother does not take her depression pills. We are not sure about the cause, could be both attention seeking and simple forgetfulness, but the issue is serious as she once already had a temporary psychotic episode (thinking there are people in her house, that someone locked her inside even though she just lost her keys), due  to taking the pills and then abruptly stopping.   


Unfortunately, after that we had to get her to an old people's house as we live in a totally different city and the family that is there does not pay enough attention to her to keep her on her toes with her pills. However, she is a very assertive, and proud person so we think it is best that once she is comfortably back on her meds to let her live alone again, if she so desires.  


To that end I am looking for some intelligent contraptions, perhaps with a camera, that will track whether my grandmother actually does take her meds, and notify us wirelessly. Did any of you have experience with similar machines? Do you have any to recommend?","https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/umiosv/automatic_medicine_dispenser_that_doesnt_suck/

Alzheimers,I can't handle it at a young age.,"My grandmother was diagnosed when i was about 7-8 years old. I lived only with her and my mother, so i had to take care of her when she had her first stage of the disease while my mother was working. I was too young to realize how terrible this disease is, so at first it didn't make me feel wrong about it. I used to walk out my grandma, so in fact i was watching after her instead of her watching after me. Giving food, helping as much as i can, i did everything, and life still didn't seem to be bad or different from how it's supposed to be. Soon, maybe, at the age of 10, it started to get worse, grandma started to be way more agressive, and whem mom wasn't at home she could hit me or start yelling curses for no reason. I think that's the moment when i started to realize everything. I am 15 now, and i am exhausted. As it got worse, when grandma started to yell at night or at any other time, I can't stand it anymore. Of course i don't take care of her as i used to before, i am not physically able to do that, so everything lays on my mother's shoulders. I think it's obvious that it causes her to be an extremly nervous person, i know the reasons and can't blame her, but it feels so unsafe in this world when even her, the only person that is supposed to be for me the strongest one and ""protect"" me is not dealing with all these things. I could even say that i feel like the only adult in our apartment, as i always support my mother and be her psychologist. I lost my interest in many things, i don't see my future at all, like i am tied to a chain that doesn't let me live my life normally. Last two-three years seem to be the most difficult to me. I also started to have problems with my nevres too, seeing nightmares and feeling things that i don't want to feel at all. My health is also deteriorating in the face of this. It makes me estrange from my friends, i always feel like i am ""incomplete"" when i talk to them, knowing that they don't have to deal with the same things i do. I started to convince myself that i should be grateful for that: my situation made me question at lof ot things in my life earlier that i should have, and I always hear that i am a pretty mature person. But do i want all these things instead of a fun childhood and unforgettable youth? And it comes to anger, when they complain about anything in their lifes, which is a very wrong reaction, and since i can't talk about it with anyone, all this anger sits inside my head all the time. If i tell my friends, there is no way they understand or help me, so i want to at least make them think that i have a normal life. My mother seems to realize how it affects on me, but she doesn't want to admit it (in which i don't blame her at all), so despite how stupid it sounds, it makes me feel like there's no one in the world who can understand me. I am sure that there are people of my age who deal with that, but i never had a chance to meet them, and searching on internet didn't help too. About a half a year ago i visited one alzheimer forum that was on my language, and people on it didn't take me seriously and thought that i am a troll cause of my age and cause that i was writing without any mistakes on my native language. That was the last time i had any hopes to find some understanding from other people. All i want is to have a normal life, or at least go through it without damaging myself too much. I have thoughts that i don't want to have, i feel separeted from my friends that are living differenetly, and i feel how my grandma's disease dragging me to thevery bottom of excistens. I can't study in school normally, can't enjoy my interests and that's only because of my family problem that is not leaving my head even for a moment. We can't send grandma to a specified hospital, because it is very expensive for us, and mom doesn't want to let her be in a free hospital, beacuse it's patients are usually dying in a short period of time, and that's why it feels hopeless for me. I have two more years in school to study, and that's not even a fact that i will be able to leave my mother and grandma when i end school. I am not even sure if i am ready to leave my mother along with that problem. Two months ago i had my last hope - a psychologist. I finally was enough brave to visit a doctor, but the result wasn't pleasant at all. The only thing i got is ""finding the problem"" using ""metaphorical cards"", and i was told that i am coping my grandmother's behaivour, which didn't help the situation in any way so i pretended that it was helpful and stopped visiting her. She was a good person, but didn't seem to know how to help me. I started to be paranoic, feeling like my mother and me are going to get alzeimers too, since my second grandma that is living in other country has this disease too, and i am not going to get a normal life ever. I started to have questionable ideologies in my head. I feel like my mind is corrupted, i feel like i am dying. I find my peace in music, but for how many years is it going to help me going trought this? Asking ""what should i do"" is pointless, as i know that there's nothing can be done.  
I just needed to share this with at least anyone, thank you for reading.","You are currently 15?  

&nbsp;

Ok.  I'm just a married woman in Louisiana, so I'm no expert, but here's my advice.  It's time for you to be selfish.  


&nbsp;


None of this situation is your fault.  It's not even your responsibility.  Go be a kid.  Go hang with your friends.  Find a private place to relax, study, draw, listen to music, chill.  Be selfish.


&nbsp;

Have you ever seen the instructions when flying on an airplane, where they tell you to ""put the oxygen mask on yourself first, BEFORE helping anyone else""?  Do that.  Take care of your happiness first.  Then you can be HAPPY for your mom - and that will give her strength.

&nbsp;

Consider what your therapist told you.  Are you mimicking your grandmother's... anxiety?  fear?  confusion?  frustration?  Shrug that garbage right off.  It's not YOUR burden.  

&nbsp;

I don't know if you are religious, but in my family we say, ""Give it to God.""  All your worries and fears... shrug them off.  Give them to God.

&nbsp;

I wish you all the best, kiddo.  Sometimes ya just need to vent.  I TOTALLY get that.  But understand, a LOT of angst comes with being 15.  That's 100% normal.  Everything feels big and important and permanent.  Your feelings are normal.  

&nbsp;

Be selfish.  Find some good, healthy fun stuff to do.  Give the heavy stuff to God.  You're 15.
i've been through a bit of therapy and it's hard finding the right therapist. not just a therapist, but a person to talk to. just keep trying. talk to your close friends about it, it'll help. 

one thing you should do is clean up this text (use paragraphs, makes it easier to read) in your native language, print it out or write it and show it to your mom. talk to her, explain, it's going to be easier to find a solution together. 

maybe you guys can work out a schedule where you take care of grandma for a day, then she does, etc. so both of you can take breaks and be stronger for each other.

it's completely reasonable to have a healthy fear of alzheimers when getting older, if you family has a history of it. you can act preventively, there's all sorts of stuff you can eat and do to reduce the risks and onset. channel your energy into that. 

my grandma took care of her mom and it was a similar situation like yours, great grandma was often abusive. now i'm taking care of my grandma (also alzheimers but not very advanced) and so far we've been having a great time (although she's very difficult at times and i lose my patience every couple of months). 

my heart breaks for you, wish you all the best.
You're far too young. What you're dealing with is caregiver burnout, it happens to many, and as I was told at the memory care community we ended up putting my mom in, it's a big reason for the high turnover rates with dementia caregivers. It's an exhausting (mentally, emotionally, and physically) disease.

I agree with Gold-Eyed-Cat. Be selfish. This is too much for you, and you sound to me like you're already dealing with anxiety and possibly depression. I've been there. It sucks. Get up the courage again to see a therapist, but ask specifically one who specializes in caregiver burnout. My current therapist said most people need to see three or four before they find one who is the right fit.",2022-05-13 06:20:14,selan123,uook8x
Alzheimers,Opinions on moving at early onset stage,"I'd appreciate your opinions on this question. The situation is this: A couple in their late 70s, slowing down but still fully independent, have been in their current home for 10+ years, so it's very familiar, but also a bit too big for them. Wife was recently diagnosed with early onset, so anyone's guess as to how quickly things will progress. 

With the market as it is, they were thinking of selling their house and getting a condo, but now with this diagnosis, the question is should they: 

(a) stay in the house, as it's more familiar, but may not be as safe and will get more difficult to maintain, 

(b) buy a condo as planned but potentially run into issues with familiarity if the Alzheimer's progresses quickly, or 

(c) get a condo or apartment in a senior living building, with 24 hr available support on site, meals in a dining room, etc., but still risk the lack of familiarity plus the fear that being around others like this will ""age us faster"". 

I appreciate any insight into the options, or maybe other options we haven't considered.","Do you mean early stage dementia? Early onset is diagnosed before age 65.  Late onset (such as diagnosed in late 70's as you said) tends to progress slower. It makes sense for a couple in their late 70's to be looking at downsizing into a single level home with features such as a roll-in or walk in shower, and preferably close to family. Familiarity is not a big factor at this point - she's early stage, plus there's a point where even a lifetime home is no longer familiar. They are better off moving sooner than later as far as dementia is concerned. And if it's to a safer and more convenient environment that will be more valuable than familiarity. If they decide to go into independent living in a senior facility, it will be helpful to choose one that offers a higher level of care for when it's necessary. For instance, aides that can come into their existing apartment to provide care for the wife. And maybe a memory care facility if that becomes necessary down the road.
C

Or at least this is what I did for my loved one. Basically exactly what you laid out.

At least you have resources already available at a continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) for when trouble strikes.  I would recommend this type of place unless they can meticulously plan for options should the caregiving spouse get sick/hurt or have family able and willing to step in and care for both of them (then have them read just a few of the caregiver stories on this subreddit).  They are basically condos anyway. 

I will try to follow up with more thoughts when I have more time later or if you have any questions about my experience lmk.
>the fear that being around others like this will ""age us faster"".

This is erroneous.  Many residents really benefit from lots of social contact with others their own age.  A move to assisted living or even just 55+ independent living can actually be protective against memory loss, because socializing is great brain exercise, and recreational activities provided by the management can also be uplifting and fun.
My mother-in-law has early onset. Diagnosed before 60 and now in the later stages. My opinion? Selling and getting a one story, easy to maintain and handicap accessible condo is the way to go. If she’s recently diagnosed that’s definitely the way. You have time to get her familiar. As the disease progresses, by the time she gets to where she’s forgetting more recent memories, it won’t matter. But the accessibility, the handicap features, the ease of maintenance - that all will. C is also an option but it doesn’t sound like you are there yet. It’s been 10 years since my mother in law was diagnosed. It progressed more slowly at first and quicker toward the end. I’m sorry you are going through this and if I can be of any more help let me know. I know there are less early onset diagnosis’s on this forum than later.
B or C, absolutely.  Now is the time to move out of an overly-large difficult-to-maintain home. Fast.  Don't dilly-dally or dawdle too much - like within the next year would be great.  There is time to get familiarity with a new place.
Move now. Memories can still be made in a new place if it’s early in symptoms and retention. One of the reasons why people die so fast after being moved to an assisted living facility is that nothing is familiar anymore. They wake up every day, terrified, in an unfamiliar place. I’d want to die too. 

If you think you’re going to need to move at all, move now. Yesterday even.
It's much easier to move someone with Dementia while they are in the early stages. This gives them some time to get used to the new surroundings.  The longer you wait the more it tends to affect the Dementia.
My wife has early onset Alzheimer’s diagnosed 7 years ago.  We went ahead and moved into a condo and it was by far the best option for us.  The independent living can also be an excellent option, but we are in our fifties so didn’t really want to go that route personally.  Another commenter noted the opportunity to socialize in the assisted living facilities is a big plus which I absolutely agree with. Isolation is something that is very easy to fall into as the disease progresses and friends fall away.  Voice of experience.  Downsizing and simplifying now before the demands of the disease grow is absolutely the way to go.  I have no extra time or energy to devote to house maintenance, that’s certain.
I would say C, with B as a far, far second. 

Moving sooner is more likely to result in a successful move - she's in the stages where she can still learn new routines, and, in fact, it can be mentally stimulating learning a new environment & new routines, which can slow progress of the disease.

In addition, a good senior living place (they should be picky) offers: an enhanced social calendar (also a key element in slowing decline), new friends, a better support network for the husband who will be grieving her decline & need some people who truly get it. 

A lot of senior living places feel like warehousing for old people, but there are some great ones. The best one I saw, it was clear the residents loved being there. They could come & go as they pleased, host family, take vacations, but when they were at home, there was a wide array of activities (across all ability levels) for them to do every day: exercise classes, language classes, creative writing, visits to museums, gardens, hiking groups, birdwatching, on-site movie theater, daily cocktail hour, live music, etc. I was about ready to move in myself.

I'd encourage them to check a few places out while they are considering their options. You get a pretty good sense of places when you tour. But in general they should look for:
1) Do residents seem alert and active? 
2) Do residents engage with visitors? (we went to 8 places, only 2 had residents randomly come up to us and tell us how much they enjoyed living there. 
3) Longevity of staff/staff turnover (the really nice place had departments heads & team leads who had all been there for 5+ years.)
My wife early 70 has early onset alz as well and stating to get worse.  We still go on many trips and never have issues. I don't see any issues selling and down sizing, the sooner the better.",2022-05-12 23:28:13,have2gopee,uoincj
Alzheimers,Memory care and aggressive behavior?,"Mom is going to start looking at memory care facilities but is worried about dad being kicked out because he exhibits frustrated/aggressive behavior on occasion. So far it isn't anything violent but his dad, who also most likely had alzheimers, was kicked out of his assisted living facility because he was violent toward a nurse. I guess my question is, what behaviors will get dad ejected from a memory care facility or what type of facility should we be looking for that can handle patients with violent behavior?","I was told they would help me work to see if it was a fixable issue should my dad get violent. (I.e. medication, or trying to find the trigger) but if it were to get too bad for them they would work with me to find new accommodations...although I'm guessing that would be a psych ward.
When we were looking to place dad it really depended on the facility. They do evaluations and make the call. Our first choice told us they couldn't handle aggressive patients but did recommend several places that could. They'll let you know, and as behavior changes make recommendations to handle it.
It's difficult to predict.  A patient might develop a paranoia or frustration with a situation or care worker.  I always try to brief the staff on how to get the best behavior out of my partner.  Example, he likes to feel useful so give him some task to do for the benefit of the organization.  (towel folding kind of thing)

Sometimes difficult or aggressive patients can be pacified chemically.  That sounds horrible, but its better than wandering in the wilderness unattended.
It's my understanding that the care workers who specialize in memory care know it's part of the disease. My dad tries to hit sometimes but the staff redirects him and never complains.
Any violence at all is often the end of the contract. Unless he is specifically put into a hospital designed to deal with violent patients who are hard to control. But you may lose some control over what may happen to him, as violence often leads to forced sedation (not sure if that would even work with Alzheimer's) or restraints. Really gets grim at this point.
No facility is going to put up with violent behavior that puts staff or other patients at risk. They will require it to be brought under control with medication or he will be asked to leave. This will make it harder to find a new place to take him, so it's best avoided. Talk to a geriatric psychiatrist now about how the outbursts can be controlled. And also look into what is triggering the outbursts and whether there are behavior modifications you can do on your end. Sometimes a caregiver is contributing to the problem without realizing it. For the same reason, ask about the training programs provided to the staff at the memory care facility. This can make a big difference.",2022-05-12 19:13:48,luvsalltheanimals,uodyez
Alzheimers,Mom in hospice care. advice,"my mum has alz close to 11 years, She is now admitted to hospice care and I was told the end is near...What helped you deal with this? Any tips ? I really don't know what to do","Friend, my mother passed away last month after 12 years of Alzheimer’s. She was in hospice for about a month. 

Hospice is wonderful. All they care about is you mum’s and your comfort.  They can answer questions and help you on this last stage of her journey.  When they say that the “end is near”, they know what they are talking about.  

Your mother is about to be free of this disease after 11 long years.  So are you. You’re going to be ok.  We’re all here for you.
Both my parents and mother-in-law went through hospice care (all cancer).

All three were conscious for only a couple of days when they went in and then slipped into a coma and past away after being there roughly 10 days.

A lot of family and friends lived out of state and couldn’t visit. So I set up FaceTime with everyone. They were so grateful, it kept me busy and I felt like I was doing something important.
My grandmother just passed after being on hospice since November 2021. I would say prepare for her to have ups and down. We thought my grandmother was going to die multiple times and she bounced back and it takes a toll on you emotionally. It could be a fast process or a slower one. Also prepare your house for potential medical equipment. In the last few weeks we had a hospital bed brought in and a potty chair because she could barely walk. She stopped eating for 19 days before she died, we couldn’t get her to eat and hospice said not to force her. It was hard to watch her whither away and she looked nothing liked she used to. These are the things I leaned living with her. I’m sorry you’re going through this.
I'm really sorry you are going through this and I am sending you a big hug.
Knowing that you did all you could through the years and telling them you love them all the time is good, because it does not leave things unsaid. Make sure to tell her everything you feel, do not leave out anything you could regret. 
Doing activities you both enjoy together is good, like music or even looking at pictures :)
My mother-in-law just got approved for hospice too after many years. The nicest part is that she is getting more help now. She recently stopped being able to walk and they were very fast at getting her a hospital bed and reclining wheelchair. I’m just hopeful that she’ll be at peace soon. 

I’m very sorry that you’re going through this.
Hospice will have a social worker on staff, you can give them a call. They help you with anticipatory grief and explain the dying process.
Hospice is an add on service so they usually just check in daily. Ask them questions. Tell them what scares you, what is going to happen..,  They are there for you as well. 

Talk to your Mum and say goodbye. My mother suddenly knew who I was at the end. Say whatever you want and need to say. 

I was shocked at how upset I was when she started Hospice since I had been grieving every loss along the way. It took her a long time to transition, but it was very peaceful. I first felt sad, but also peaceful and was glad her suffering had ended. Then I felt empty and very, very sad. Mom passed in August. I still feel sad, but the terrible sadness has lessened and I can remember happier times better.",2022-05-11 20:43:06,anxietyokra,unoggq
Alzheimers,Any advice for dealing with extreme compulsions?,"Partly just to vent.

My dad is doing his best to care for my mom and us kids try to share some responsibility to help when we can.  I have not seen the exact diagnosis for what my mom has...I believe my dad that it's Alzheimers but it feels like it has manifested a little differently from most peoples' experiences.  She is not yet at the point of forgetting who people are, not at all.  However she does forget the events of the day or any plans, and will ask over and over what time such-and-such is happening, unless the events are pretty significant like someone's death.  For example, every time I have seen her for the past year, she brings up how hard it must be for the family of someone who died of Covid over a year ago now.

Her main issue is overwhelmingly strong compulsions to do the few things she is still able to do.

She cannot sew, knit, do puzzles, watch TV/movies, or play games of any kind, and generally refuses to read books or just sit still.  All of these things seem to be overwhelming to her and she can't even get started on them.  This is what she can do:

* Dishes and laundry (when she feels like it, and doesn't last long)

* Check her email, Facebook, and mass-collect free eBooks (all trashy, but she has no idea; this also does not last more than a few hours per day)

* Go on long walks up and down the road picking up trash (she has never gotten lost)

* Recently, overeating any snacks she can find

If allowed to, she would walk endlessly, to the point of physically harming herself, but pain apparently doesn't register as a reason to stop.  When it's in her head, every 2 minutes she will beg and plead and find any excuse, swear that she won't walk for the rest of the week if you only let her go for a little while.  If you do extract a promise that it will be a short walk, she will go right past where you say she can (GPS tracker is a godsend).  If it was someone fully in control of their faculties, I would call it manipulative or sneaky, but it's the compulsion talking.  She takes every tiny candy wrapper all the way outside to the trash can just to get the experience of walking briefly.  For mother's day we took her to a state park to walk a trail together and on the drive home when we were all exhausted she was hinting that she wanted to go walk as soon as we got home.  She can't be left alone anymore, sometimes even when you're home with her.  Hiding shoes doesn't help, she has gone out barefoot at least once.  Locks are not really a good solution in case of emergencies.

She will also wear clothing inappropriate to the weather and takes a long period of adjustment to stop wearing coats in the heat (now) and start wearing them in the winter.  Fortunately she does seem to not want to walk when it's clearly raining or snowing, and on those days doesn't even ask.  Easiest days we have.

She likes going to any store as well, whether you need to or not.  If she can't walk, she wants to go to Wal-Marts or local bakeries, and just does a circuit with you as you pick up the few things you need (due to constant visits on her behalf).  And asks constant questions about stopping anywhere else as well.

Recently we have had to hide food because she will sneak any snacks she can find.  If you tell her to stop, she just smiles like ""oh I'm being so naughty,"" but doesn't realize she's been doing it constantly.  Yesterday when all food was out of reach, she was caught eating dog treats. :(

She was over at my house with dad today working on some outdoor chores.  Because it's unfamiliar territory she couldn't walk, and because we weren't indoors she couldn't snack.  I think she short-circuited and asked to go to the bathroom 6 times in 30 minutes, because there just wasn't anything else to do.  She also found bits of trash on the sidewalk and put it in my garbage cans even though we asked her to stop.

She is on daily pills and a few times we have given her a Tylenol PM in the morning and that has helped a ton...but this isn't really something we should do long term.  I've been curious what affect something like Adderall might have on her, but doctors will not prescribe anything other than what she is on, and just say she requires constant care.

Dad is having a terrible time.  I want to be able to do more but my sisters and I all have jobs and other demands.

Is there anything we can do about these overwhelming compulsions?  Is there any activity we haven't thought of to try to have her do that might keep her attention?","Do you have access go a day caregiver? I was thinking maybe an extra hand at home - and someone that can do some activities with her and has the medical knowledge or experience - might be able to lift some weight from your father's shoulders.
She might benefit from an adult day care.  It will be stimulating to her, and they may do a little walking on nice days (supervised).

It seems to me she might have a type of restless leg syndrome related to her brain damage.  

The day will come when she doesn't walk at all, just lies in bed.  As inconvenient as it may be, it's who she is today.  I don't know of a cure.

My husband always wanted to go for walks on his own but a few years later now, he knows he can't find his way home, and doesn't try.  He also would dress inappropriately for the weather.  He went out barefoot in winter weather.  Another time he had shoes and socks on but no clothes!  His diagnosis is Alzheimers.
Treadmill & those virtual reality headsets? 

Can you hire someone to go on walks with her and then bring her home? 

Maybe gum to replace snacks? Or snacks that take longer to eat/chew? Jerky, frozen red vines, hard candies, etc. 

Sorry, I’m not much help.
When my wife was like this, even eating a Milk Bone, the Doc prescribed Clonazipam and it helped a lot. Do you know what meds she is taking?
My mum also has the walking thing, and the snacking thing, since many years - and the trash pick-up thing too!.   Just have to deal with it.  They've lost so much physical ability and/or comprehension to do other activities, I feel mean trying to stop her from doing what she still can.   (Alzhms diagnosis 12 yrs ago)She also is not at all a day-time tv watcher, not unless it's pouring rain.

Gosh, yr mom can still check facebook & navigate internet?  Wow!  My mum can barely manage to change tv channels . Doesn't forget people, forgets anything that's happened even just half-hour ago - vaguely remembers when reminded.  Can't even remember a few hours after being told of family deaths - not our immediate family, like her in-laws.  Could you find some websites of simple games for her, mark them in her favourites, or on a note next to the computer?

Snacking thing - leave variety of low-cal but nutritious snacks.  Fruit (having to peel mandarins/oranges even better), yogurt snack-packs, plain puffed-rice/corn cracker-wafer things (you know, the palm-sized round ones) muesli bars... Kids lunch-box snacks of dried fruit strips, sultanas, whatever low-cal low-sugar snacks I can find... I buy variety of them when they're / whatever is on half-price sale.   
It used to annoy heck out of me that she'd be eating smaller lunch / dinner portions due to snacking - but it's not the end of the world, in the big scheme of things, actually.  If the snacks are nutritious, and she's not gaining excessive weight or complicating any other health issues - it doesn't matter.  She's losing her mind, I'm not gonna stop her from grazing snacks if she wants to.

Mum used to do lot of simple xword puzzles but they're beyond her now, she does WordSearch though.   
 I always go through the books and randomly start a few for her here & there, it's encouraging to her when some are already started, rather than give her a fresh blank book - then she's much more unlikely to do some.   
 Leave a few around already opened to the page with a pen right there.  Like, next to her armchair, next to verandah chair, on the garden table.  With a snack next to it, & glass of water.  Encourages to sit down have a snack do a puzzle, rather than walking walking.  
Same with the adults 'mindful' colouring books, I start bits on a bunch of pages (then tell her 'look, you've already started these ones why don't you finish them' lol) but she doesn't like them so much.

Having been a kids school teacher all her life after spending so much time on play-ground duty, she also had/has the pick-the-rubbish-up thing - so frustrating.  Have at least got her mostly off that thank goodness.  I've repeated thousands times 'stop it, don't know what germs are on that,  now you need to wash yr hands, you're not council garbage-picker-upper, just leave it'.   But she'll do it when I'm not with her.

Walking - as they say, 'use it or lose it'.  Yr mom has GPS tracker?  Cool!We don't - she has an engraved SafeReturn bracelet.    I changed all her clothing to colourful items  (easier for motorists to see?), good walking shoes with velcro fastenings & gel/comfort inserts.  She's going to do it, just need to make her as safe as possible. At least she'll only walk round our suburb.

I need to manage her wardrobe season-appropriate, sounds like you ought to also  -- pack away the heavy coats after winter, the flimsy stuff after summer...

She also likes to get the tram up or walk up to the shops for 'something'.  So, if I'm out for a few hours or the rare away for the day,  I leave out on her bedside table small change & small bills.  Enough for - a newspaper - (next trip) a loaf of bread - (next trip) a litre of milk - (next trip) a snack lol etc etc....

Our garden rake & broom, she loves sweeping the pavement outside our place.  Usually there's at least some leaves, always the odd random people passing doggy walking, mums with kids in prams, whatever... She sweeps it (seemingly obsessively) multiple times a day.  Yeh, she just can't manage lot of other pass-times, can't think of what to start.

Could you get yr mom some of those things like - a big jar of different coloured & sized buttons or ribbons or beads to sort into separate tupperware containers?  Thrift stores are good for gaining collections of such things.

We're lucky at least down her in Aust we can get in-home care & dementia-appropriate day-care / respite outings quite economically or even free, for pensioners, and we're in a major city, so they have quite a few programs.  She goes out with them now up to 4 days a week thank gods.  It's heaven-send salvation for me to get time off, I'm 24/7 carer.  During covid when it all shut down I was near nervous breakdown. I feel for folk in country towns, & other countries where they don't have such programs easily & cheaply accessible.

I have been researching the combination of curcumin with piperine (to improve curcumin absorption and bioavailability) and research into its effects on alzheimer's, memory loss and cognitive decline in general, but found very few human studies despite there are studies with rats of curcumin and its effects, and although curcumin is safe, after all they are common spice substances, and there is a study that shows that piperine increases the bioavailability of curcumin by 2000%, is there any study that has done this test? have you tested the combination of these compounds combined for these causes?

At clinically relevant dosages?","I found this but it seems to be more of an ""it can't hurt"" rather than anything else.

 https://www.alzheimersorganization.org/turmeric-curcumin-and-alzheimers
You're talking about ingredients in turmeric and black pepper. I can't tell if this is naive, or a joke in supremely bad taste.

It’s certainly part of the Bredesen Protocol if necessary.

Alzheimers,How to explain Alzheimer's disease to children?,"It is undeniable that explaining Alzheimer’s to children is no simple task. Children may not understand why their grandparent, who once used to take care of them, picked them up from school or gave them a snack, can no longer do those things. Therefore, the first thing we should do is to **explain to the child what is happening to their grandparent in language that is suitable for the child’s age**.

“Your grandpa (or grandma) has Alzheimer’s, a disease that causes the brain to forget things.” But Alzheimer’s is not just memory loss, and the child needs to be able to understand all the other symptoms little by little.

Reassure your child with [simple, honest explanations of the disease.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/caregivers/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20043890)","Here is a guide on just that from the Alzheimer's Association

Thanks for this. My toddler and his great grandmother are best friends, but I know he will start to notice as her condition declines. This was one of the topics I joined the sub for.",2022-05-11 07:52:18,HugNup,un81pr
Alzheimers,Im losing it,"My grandmother has got alzheimer's for about 1 year, I moved in with her 5months ago. I have always noticed the situation getting worse. I keep telling her something over and over until she gets it. I understand that what she say is not what she means and she'll say hurtful things and I have always not cared about her insults. But recently her situation worsened and all these methods are not working anymore. I found myself scolding her today, im so so sorry. I dont know what to do. She doesnt want to eat her meds but thats another shitshow too long to explain.","As grandmother changes, you will have to adapt to her current state and needs, because she no longer has the capacity to adapt to yours.  For instance, if she won't take her drugs, you might be able to open a capsule to sprinkle on her applesauce, or grind the solid pills and do the same.  Check with a phone call to your doctor's nurse.

If you have to say something over and over or she asks you the same question, don't look at the literal communication but at the emotional.  If she asks again and again if you are going to the doctor this afternoon, you can say, ""I see you're a little worried about us missing the appointment, but don't worry, I'm on top of it.  Say, would you like a cookie and milk?""  That is called redirecting.

I'm sorry you have such challenges, but so do many other caregivers.  If there's any way you can join a dementia caregivers support group, it will help you feel better about your role and  you'll learn these kinds of tips.
I started blending my mom's meds into her Ensure drinks about a year ago. I pour it into a toddler style sippy cup with a ""home made modified"" open top for her to drink easier. Works in my case.
First, Im sorry you and your grandmother are having to deal with this

Second, you may need to look at the medications.  Just because she has Alzheimers doesn't mean she doesn't know that there's something about her medications she doesn't like.  But she may not be able to tell you.

Good luck
Be firm but don't place guilt. Don't get emotional.  Simply stand your ground. Push gently but firmly. 

Stay strong!
Please look into Dr Dale Bredesen’s work and check out the Bredesen Protocol. It may be worth seeing if your grandmother is a fit candidate for this and you may be the right person to guide her through this. ReCODE (Reversal of Cognitive Decline) is better than nothing.

Alzheimers,My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in October and is going downhill quickly,"As the title states, my mother (70) was diagnosed in October and is going downhill rapidly, imo.

Just last month, she was able to remember what happened that day. She was able to remember appointments she had, maybe not the exact date, but she remembered. She, pretty much, remembered what I told her during our visits.

I visited her yesterday and she's so much worse. She asked the same questions over and over. She couldn't remember what she said just minutes before. I just answered her like she'd never asked those questions before. She kept saying she needed a haircut and I'd answer, for the 4th time, that she has an appointment for next month. She couldn't remember Dr appointments she just had. I'm so afraid that next month she won't remember me. I'm so worried for her and it breaks my heart. I guess I just wanted to vent.

Also, some of you may see this twice, as I accidentally posted in r/Alzheimersgroup. I feel badly, so I deleted. I didn't know it was specifically for people with Alzheimer's.","It’s going to be a different experience for everyone, but I notice with my mom (68) that keeping the fundamentals to a routine makes a huge difference in her having good days. That means a real emphasis on sleep, nutrition (this one is hard), walking the dog with my dad, and low stress. This last one I find to be the biggest. If she gets emotional/upset, the day is done and she is exhausted. She’ll have a few bad and foggy days after that.
I'm sorry

Good luck
I'm so sorry.  This disease varies by the day - it's a real grab-bag of symptoms.  One day you'll never know she has it, the next she's all over the place.  Some days they can hold it together, some days not.  It just really depends.  My mother and my MIL both have dementia, and it manifested in markedly different ways.  My mom (who also has narcissistic personality disorder) became mean & nasty.  My MIL has become very meek & mild.  Unfortunately she's going to have her good days and her bad days.

ETA - I see her sleep schedule is messed up.  That gets worse as it progresses as well.  I don't think my mother ever slept.  She is in a nursing facility now, so they make sure she gets her rest.  My MIL is up until 3 in the morning, then is up wide awake at 6am.  She falls asleep during the day watching TV.
My dad was diagnosed at 62. We had noticed minor slips for years and for a while we weren’t sure if it was early signs or issues due to his blindness. Also he took great pride in “fooling” the neurologist and making sure they thought he was totally fine. 

It went very quickly after that. By 64 he often forgot who we were and was unable to be left unsupervised for more than a few minutes at a time. 

He just passed anyway last month at 66. 

Honestly the doctors had little input on why it would progress so quickly. They ran a lot of tests looking for other possible diseases or other things that might also cause mental symptoms. 

For a while though he went back and forth between moments of clarity and understanding and days/moments when it was very clear he was losing it all. 

It’s no easy road. Make sure to take care of yourself. And feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to.
Went through similar with my parent. They were diagnosed when we noticed some minor symptoms and seemed to slide downhill very quickly. Wishing you many good days and peace.
Oh, your poor brother. That's got to hurt. I've heard of dementia patients claiming someone stole their stuff. So difficult.

Thank you so much for your kind words 😊 💕",2022-05-10 17:36:52,DexterCutie,umtgjr
Alzheimers,Advice needed- Dad has Alzheimer’s,"Hi all! My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about two years ago. My mom is his only caregiver and he’s declining pretty fast. He is still able to dress himself (though it’s usually dirty laundry because he can’t remember where the clean clothes are) and his memory is about 3 minutes now. He’s starting to get a little angrier than before when he can’t remember to do something and he gets really down on himself. They are both amazing people. They live about 1.5 hours away and I try to see them as often as possible. Does anyone have advice on what to do to support the other parent? I try to call my mom as often as possible but I cannot imagine how hard this must be for her as well. She isn’t able to go out or even really leave the house. I’ve contemplated moving down there to help out (I’m an only child and our closest family is about 8 hours away) so it could make her life a little easier and she would be able to get out of the house. He’s at the point where he can’t be left alone anymore. I’m nervous I’ll regret not moving down there and helping out before things take a turn for the worse. I’m not trying to make this about myself, just having a lot of mixed emotions. Has anyone been in this situation and can give some advice? Am I overthinking everything? Has anyone moved to help take care of their parent? Please help. Thank you all in advance.","First, sorry

This condition sucks

I moved in with my grandfather 5 years ago.  I was back visiting when he broke his leg.  I stayed to get him through that, and by the time that was healed his Alzheimer's was too bad for him to live on own

I'm currently planning to move to another state so he can be in an assisted living where his GF (the woman he was living with prior) lives and closer to his sister and a few other friends and family. 

This is a truly personal decision with no right or wrong answer.

Just try and know what you're getting into.  Caregiving is tough.  There are good moments and terrible ones.  And nothing really too look forward to.  It's only going to get worse. 

It is going to impact your relationship with your mom (and dad) If you're lucky, it'll strengthen the bonds between you.  If you're l less lucky it'll exacerbate any frictions.  

Unless your mom is a superhero, she can't do it alone, and good for you for recognizing that fairly early on it sounds like.

If you move there, or not, remember there is outside help.  There is home care, respite housing and support groups.  You may need all of these at some point.  

The Alzheimer's Association is a good resource.  They have info about resources.  I found their classes (from info about the condition to info about legal issues) very helpful.  

It sounds like you're not moving too far from where you are now, so you won't be as isolated as I've been (i changed countries when I moved), so that's good.  But, obviously, it's going to be a drain on your spare time.  So, you and your mom will have to figure things out so you both can attend to your personal needs as well as your dad's.
Oh man, I’m so sorry. My dad had dementia and my mom took care of him by herself for way too long. She burned herself out. If you don’t move to be closer, try to convince you mom to take your dad to adult daycare or hire part time help so she can get away by herself. 
If you do move to be closer, try to not only give your mom respite, but also help her with the physical labor involved in caring for someone with dementia. If you can take your dad out of the house to give your mom time alone in her own house, she would probably be appreciative of that as well. This is a really difficult journey and I wish you all the best.
Medicate, medicate, medicate.  People think this is admitting defeat or a last resort option.  It is FOR the comfort and care of the patient as well as easing the burden of the caregiver.  It doesn’t sound like your father needs much, just something to calm the anxiety and frustration. Tell the neurologist exactly the type of behavior than is not normal for him and they will prescribe the appropriate medication.  Finding out now what works and what doesn’t will make it much easier later on too
I’m in a similar situation, my sister is on the other side of the world and although my dad is okay right now (diagnosed 6 months ago and the memory clinic nurse classed him as mild to moderate) and can be left alone (we have echo show/blink cameras throughout the house to communicate with him frequently… right now it involves a lot of reminding him how to use the remote etc) but we’re not kidding ourselves and understand that this will change. I live around 4 hours away and am able to stay with them in their house for around a week every month to help out with practical stuff and just spend as much time with them as possible and encourage my mum to get time to herself. OP - I know what you mean, I feel like I’m making it about myself when I question if I’m doing enough or if it’s time to move closer. I understand that I will have to at some point, but when?
Your mother will benefit by having an occasional respite worker so she can get out of the house, without having to leave your dad alone.  This will be necessary at some point, so they might as well get used to it now.  If they can't afford it, you could offer to pay.  It might be offered as a help to your mom with household affairs, now that she is getting older.  

On her respite days, your mom should try to go to a caregiver support group if she can find one (try the local senior center or the Alzheimer's charities) or maybe she'd also enjoy getting her hair done.

These are little things but they can be so very valuable.
My dad is in year 5 and declining fast.  I lived about an hour and a half away as well and my mom chose to move closer to me because she couldn't handle the farm on her own and I had just had a baby and she wanted to spend time with my daughter.

It's been extremely hard, but I feel comfortable that they are 3 miles away and I can get there to diffuse situations that come up.  Rather than having to leave work grab my 2 year old and head on up to my parents house. 

My mom will also never tell me how bad it is or how bad she feels, and the pandemic has really made it hard to find home care, or day care.  I try to take my dad out and have him come over to my house and we go for walks and that gives my mom some time to herself but I've noticed that it's really not time spent relaxing it's time just catching up on errands and grocery shopping and things like that.

My personal experience is that I am glad that I am close to them.  I have a brother but he is distant so it's pretty much just my wife and myself.  We have to remember that nobody asked for this and we are not trained caregivers. I get a little frustrated with my mom because she will talk down to him and ask him to do things that he can't do because he can't remember anything from the time it takes him to get up out of his chair to begin the task.  

Today she was upset because they took the cardboard to the recycle place and she asked him to load up the trunk of the car.  Well he did and put the trash bag in the trunk.  Then when they got to the recycle place my mom found it and put the bag of garbage in a box in the trunk and got back in the car.  Well dad threw the box with the trash and a delivery label clearly indicating who threw their trash in the cardboard only bin. My mom was mad and I had to ask why she wasn't standing outside while he did it.  Like what do you expect?

I am often times in the role of the mediator between them and I fear what it might be if I was not there, because the relationship between my mom and dad is very weird right now. My dad thinks my mom is his mom and cannot remember my mom's name, so she is hurt by that.  

Long story short, if my mom had more help and resources available to her for in home care I might be able to handle being further away, but as it is right now there isn't much available and so I am glad I am close.
So sorry, it's hard, I feel for you, and yr mom & dad.   
I really feel for your mom, and all the partners who have to deal with it 24/7/365.   
I agree with the comments & points other folk here have made.  
 And Alzheimers org & dementia org have amazing helpful resources, counselling, information, etc etc.  
Can your folks access in-home care, get some services, respites, etc?  Can you help yr mom to access everything that would be feasible, maybe go down there for a few weeks help her ease into it?   
Idk if you ought to move back or not, nobody knows.  Would you live with them, or separately?  Would you be able to find work there, do you need to?  If yr dad declined super-fast & was residential by next year, would you regret moving back home, could you move back again to where you were?  What if he doesn't go residential for another 5 or 8 years, will you be ok with that, being there helping caring?  hmmmm....

Yes, I moved back from overseas to home country to care for my mum, some years after her initial diagnosis, when she started to degenerate more.  Her slide has been quite slow.  We don't really have other family within thousand kms.     
I did some free workshops & mini-courses offered by Alzhms / Dementia Aust to family / carers / friends of the memory lossed, they were of great help to me.   
She's still at home & I'm primary carer, we receive some in-home care, she has alzhms-specific day-care respite, now up to 4 or 5 days a week.  
Down here in Aust, pensioners can receive quite some services very economically or even basically for free, I'm grateful for that.  
In the beginning (as most of them do) mum was adamant she didn't need or want in-home assistance, and she didn't want oldies outings - it was frustrating but with determined pleasant persistence I got around that quick-smart  (""but just try it once, yr doctor said it's great & highly recommends, but if you get knocked over by a bicycle & break your arm it will then be a 9-month on the wait list therefore you need to be signed up & receiving already"", etc etc) - after she saw it wasn't the end of the world I increased all the services, & she's quite happy with it all & greatly enjoys going off on the day-cares.  
It was dreadful during covid, all the respite shut down, I nearly lost my mind with the endless stress, not having any time for myself for nearly a year, and then another stint for the 2nd 3rd waves etc.  Bearing in mind I'd moved back from overseas few years back and still knew virtually almost nobody here, no friends or outside support for me.  Anyways....   
I really feel for your mom, and for you!  :(  

I think, if your dad is declining pretty fast and already can't even be left alone, whether you've moved there or not, he's probably at or very near the point that residential care would be best for him for his care, and for your mom, to be able to have her own life back?  It's an awful wrench, for people to accept that, very sad.  And they don't want to, of course.  
But so if he was left alone at home he's already at danger of idk burning the house down trying to cook something?  Or wandering off in his underwear?   I had to take most of the dials off the cooker already a few years ago (I made out they were broken, waiting fixing till she forgot about them), but she doesn't underwear wander.  
So, if y'all won't go the residential path yet, I greatly hope you can get some in-home services, get him some respite day-care a few days a week, maybe even overnight respite a few times a month, that would at least give yr mom some respite, but it's still very very tough.  

Idk, consult with alzheimer / dementia org, avail yourself of all the information & resources they have.  Yr mom might be of the type to not want to face or admit that she can't cope or isn't coping, often there's a lot of guilt.  Get yr mom some counselling too - although they often even resist & reject that too.  It's tough.  

Idk, SpagheittiOrc.... Could you take off a month, go down stay with them for a month, armed with info & perspectives from alzhms org, see how that goes?  Probably would give you more clarity.  Best of luck!
I would offer this suggestion, too. We were in a very similar situation only it was my mom with Alzheimer's and then my dad was the caregiver. He had an unexpected stroke (no high blood pressure, not a smoker, no family history, no diabetes, etc.) and during the MRI, they found an orange-sized tumor next to his brain stem. He died within a month. That left us in a rush to figure out how to balance our jobs with our mom's care needs. We learned that Medicare wasn't going to help, and she had too much money to qualify for Medicaid at that point. After  year of trying to balance work with her care, it was too much and we had to put her into assisted living. She'd started wandering, was increasingly paranoid, and didn't recognize the home she'd live in for 50 years anymore.

It sucks, but it's a lesson learned that you need to plan for worst-case scenarios ASAP.
I'm sorry.  Please, whatever you do, watch for the signs that frustration has  turned to anger and can get physical.  It doesn't happen in every case, just watch for it.  I didn't see the signs soon enough.
Similar for me and my mum developed depression looking after my dad. It is a lot for one person to manage. 
They have now moved closer so we can support more.

Also, I highly recommended anti depressants for your dad. My dad takes a double dose and it has chilled him out so much. He used to get very angry and upset with his condition but is now very placid.",2022-05-10 15:10:39,spaghettiorc,umq877

It needs WiFi. If the meds are dispensed but then aren’t taken within a set period of time, the door closes and you can be notified that he missed a dose.

Alzheimers,Roho high profile cushion or purple royal seat cushion,"my mom is in late stage and has some bruises from sitting too long in the wheelchair.

I don't mind shelling out 400 dollars for the Roho high profile seat cushion but the home health nurse today recommended the purple royal seat cushion (for car or office) at 99 dollars..Not sure why she recommended a cheap cushion but based on experience, is there a big difference between roho vs. cheaper seat cushion? Which would you go with?","Just took a look at them. I'd also go with the cheaper one for a simple reason. If there is something that can be fiddled with, assume it WILL be fiddled with and potentially broken.

The fancy seat has connectors for air valves, which is probably a great feature for, idk, an office worker who uses a wheelchair.

But the best items for people with dementia, gotta be easy to use, hard to break, and cheap to replace.
Ask the nurse! Could be she recommended one that's just as good, not a rip-off. Could be she's presuming something about your ability & willingness to pay. Could be the non-car one is clumsy, heavy, awkward to reposition (if that's something you need to do).
cushion lab makes a nice one, in case you need other recommendations. I don’t know about Roho but i chose Cushion Lab over purple (although now i can’t remember why lol)

After departure of my mom, I slowly started witnessing some behavioral change of my dad. He is now 75 years old.

He would remember memories of decades ago but forgets recent memories like every day tasks. For last few days he was having some hallucinations. Couple of days back. He left home at midnight and after a few hours he got back and I asked him where did you go. He was staring at me like clueless and he couldn't remember why he left home in the midnight.

As to how fast it progresses, that is impossible to say.  Some people stay like your dad is for years and years.  Others go downhill quite fast.

You should start exploring care options for him, because even if you can take care of him now, he eventually will decline.

Alzheimers,How to convince a reluctant or denial parent that they might have Alzheimer's and need a doctor,,"It took me three years to get my wife diagnosed. I used a minor fender bender she was in, as the excuse to keep taking her back to the doctors. Doctors kept saying nothing was wrong and she would scream at me for hours if I mentioned dementia or Alzheimers symptoms. I had to gas light her a bit about her problems to keep her going back to the doctors. There is no way she would’ve kept going back to the doctors with me if I made the visits about trying to get her diagnosed for dementia.
Just take them in to the doctors for their annual checkup or because they hit some benchmark age. Same idea with the POA and living will, it's just in case they get hit by a bus and suddenly can't handle bills, consenting to surgery, etc by themselves

Denial about dementia is one of the classic symptoms. They oftendon't remember forgetting stuff. if you push it they may become paranoid that you are trying to gaslight them.
We had to wait until she was so demented that we had to call 911 to haul her to the hospital and get diagnosed, after which we went for (very expensive) legal guardianship since no durable power of attorney could be located. She had sworn years earlier that “all the paperwork was in the back of the closet”, and I have kicked myself a million times for not forcing her to SHOW ME the paperwork.  We never did find it. 

It was at least two years of chaos before we managed to gain control. Her boyfriend was sort of caring for her during that time but he couldn’t handle it and we lived a thousand miles away so it was tough to find a solution.
You can't.
Try using “Cognitive Decline” as Alzheimers is a very scary term. Or forgetfulness. Everybody can suffer from SOME cognitive decline as we get older so this could be a point to use to ease the person into considering how they’re doing with their cognition.
Book On Pluto helps wonders and they do it on their own time. I think there's a movie too.
If they won’t do it for themselves, make it about you. “Making sure you are healthy will make my life easier” or something similar.  Make going to the doctor an act of generosity for them instead of an opportunity to be old or infirm.",2022-05-09 08:25:44,chaimasalatea,ulq27p

Keep in mind that dementia can also be the case! Hope it helps.
It could be, but I’d say it’s time to get her checked out no matter what it is. Did you talk to her and ask who she was talking to?
If she is over 65 then make an appointment with her primary for an annual medicare wellness check. You or someone else should go with her and then ask your question.  When I am in doubt about any ones health, including my own, I  suggest starting with the primary care doctor.  He may not help the issue but can give advice on how to proceed to do so. Just sayin.",2022-05-09 08:37:06,hahais37,ulq9jk
Alzheimers,How to manage someone with no insight into their disease?,"Hi - my dad has vascular dementia and my mum has Alzheimers.  They moved into a specialised dementia home about a month ago.  (Both are in their early 80s)  My mum  is trying hard to adjust and settle in, but dad just isn't even trying.  He says he feels perfectly fine and doesn't need to be in there ""with all the crazies"" and he wants to go home. When we try to explain to him that it's not safe at home for them, he argues and gets upset. When we try to explain why his behaviours are unsafe he says that ""he was just joking"" when he did/said [whatever it was].  He basically lacks any insight into his illness, and I just don't know how to deal with him - not to mention the intense guilt I feel about helping to move them both in (my sister and I have PoA and Guardianship) even though I know it's the right thing to do.  My mum does have some insight into her condition, which helps.  Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas on what to say when he gets upset and angry about his new situation?","I tried very hard to reason and be logical with my Mom when she moved into Memory Care Assisted Living after my father died. It caused nothing but stress and anger on both of our parts. 

I don’t know how, or who told her, but it got into her brain that she was on vacation. Ever since then, “managing” her has been much easier. When she asks about going home, I tell her she has a week left of vacation and to enjoy it. 

Maybe that will work for you?
That's a real unfortunate situation. He still thinks he's someone who can take of himself... by himself, but the sad reality is that he can't. Their psychological insight is quite fascinating, my grandpa had Alzheimer's as well and used to say that ""he didn't want people think he was an idiot"", hence his seemingly perfect behavior with people not too familiar. Many didn't even believe he had such a disease (""we talked, he asked me things, he knows who I am"") but in reality he didn't even recognize his own daughter (my mom).

Our psychiatrist said this is is a common pattern in all forms of dementia, the condition makes them somehow aware they're not what they used to be anymore, and become angry as they don't accept the fact. Unfortunately it will last throughout their remaining life, so prepare yourself to be psychologically tough. (In later stages he will easily forget things and you can ""take advantage"" of this)

In your case, he's not completely alone having his wife besides him. Feed him into the possibility to make friends with someone else there, so he could distract his mind from his surroundings. I hope there are people not yet in an advanced stage with whom he can socialize.

Don't tax yourself, it is hard but you did the best possible choice. 💖💖💖
could you appeal to his emotions a little and ask him if he really would rather live at home alone, than be there with his wife? maybe pull on the heart strings a little by making him feel guilty for wanting to leave his wife “all alone with all the crazies” and make it sound like he actually agreed to be there for her sake, rather than his own and he shouldn’t leave her there to fend for herself “with all the crazies”
Have they suffered a fall or other injury recently? If so you say it's just until their health improves, they have to hit some goals in PT before it's safe to live at home again. Even if that's not so realistic.
Instead of telling him it's for his own good or that he has to be there, appeal to his feelings for you mother. Tell him you know he doesn't need as much help as the other people there, but your mom does and if he can show her the ropes and how nice it can be, it will help her settle in. Reasoning with him won't matter, especially if he ends up forgetting the conversation. 

White lies or deflecting the conversation away from his situation will probably help to some degree. ""I know you want to go home. Hey, can you show me how (insert anything) works? What's that over there?""
Alternately, tell Dad that he's really there just to support Mom in healing and getting better
Don't ever argue with a person with dementia.  Try to redirect them off the topic.  Or sometimes you can agree with them.  It's okay to lie, as in ""We'll get you out of this facility as soon as a suitable apartment opens up.""  Or you can sympathize:  ""It's hard to be around crazy people.  What about them bothers you the most?""

As for the guilt, please get yourself either a caregiver support group, or a therapist, or both.  It's a heavy burden and it's not necessary.  I don't mean to sound simplistic - I'm hurting, myself, having to place my husband.
“Let’s just try it for a few months and, if you still don’t like it here, we will move you back home”. Said that a thousand times to my mother and she never called my bluff or remembered me ever saying it previously.  This, obviously, only works at a certain stage of the disease.  But, having her think it’s not permanent really eased her anxiety and helped her settle in. I used to have trouble telling her blatant lies, but now I’ve gotten quite comfortable with it.  And, you get several tries to see which lie works best.  If you find one that works, stick with it and you’ll soon feel like you’re in Groundhog Day",2022-05-09 01:49:38,Megan2153,ulke8q
Alzheimers,Nursing care cost average by State,,,2022-05-08 16:30:43,CountyMinimum910,ulagua
Alzheimers,Seeing my grandpa like this is horrific and I need to vent.,"My 88 year old grandpa is an amazing person. Like seriously one of the most kind, hardworking, compassionate, intelligent, loving people I’ve ever known in my 27 years of life. But he is slipping more and more every day with this awful disease. He is also a Vietnam and Korean war vet. He and my grandma helped raise me; they were huge parts of my life. He has loved my grandma for 67 years, and loved her so incredibly well. He would go to the ends of the earth for her, do absolutely anything for her. He’s just as in love with her now as he was when they first fell in love, except now he doesn’t make much sense when he talks and I know eventually he’s going to forget us including her (if he doesn’t pass away first—he is 88 after all). I can’t stand it.

I can’t stand that they had to have my Aunts (their children) sell their house—the house that I frequently visited as a child and even temporarily lived in with them for a time—so they could move into a nursing home. And my grandma who is still of sound mind has to witness the love of her life decline every single day (they were placed in the same room). She’s one of the strongest people I’ve ever known.

At their old house (that now belongs to someone else), we’d drive down to the train station with Subway sandwiches and just watch the trains go by while chowing down. My grandpa was very knowledgeable about trains and locomotive history and it was fun to hear him tell me things while we sat there. The train station had a park attached to it and we’d go take walks there. I know those days are long gone and I’m an adult now, been an adult for a while, but it doesn’t make this process any easier. I’ve never lost a loved one before. This will be my first time and I know it’s going to be extremely difficult. Thank you for letting me vent, and I appreciate this subreddit; at least I know I’m not alone.","It is such a horrible disease. I call it modern day torture for everyone involved. I'm 27 and a caregiver for my 63 year old mom. She's in the later stages. It's so wild..and heartbreaking.. to see someone you love so much deteriorate right in front of you.. my mom is such a completely different person at this point..it's such a weird feeling grieving someone who is still right in front of you too!!! I have so many emotions of confusion, anger, sadness..it's hard to accept& process. I'm a huge advocate for self care so that's always my number one priority. Sending so much love
I feel every word of this. Dad is 85 and it's awful, watching everything that made him who he was just fade away while he's still standing right here in front of us.
I get your pain, my mom has been in a slow decline since 2006, but went into high gear 10 years later in late 2016. She is now 87 and has been immobile confined to a bed for 18 months now. She forgot who I was about 3 1/2 years ago and I'm her only child and I'm 47. It's awful, she needs help with all personal care for over 4 years now, but seeing her paralyzed in a bed now for a year and half straight in horrifying. The only peace sort of is that she has no idea about anything anymore. She's just a shell that is technically still alive.
My heart breaks for you. I’m so sorry, I entirely know how you feel. I’m not sure if I ever will accept the changes that my grandmother goes through. With every decline I feel just heartbroken. Thinking that she’ll never make me my favourite dishes again, she’ll never be my rock in life. I really miss the old her. She just changed so much for the part year. She looks so helpless now. She can’t go to the store alone, she can’t cook, she can’t go to the doctor by herself… at least she still takes care of herself, she reads, laughs. But it’s not the same. I always knew that this day could come but I thought that I will have more time and it will happen in her 90s (our family has a long lifespan). She’s 78 now and I don’t feel prepared for this. I feel like it’s too soon.
I don't know how far you live, but I'd definitively take him train watching, if he still can. He'll most likely get a kick out of it.",2022-05-08 17:03:42,candychan2,ulb5o5

Alzheimers,Hyperbaric chamber,"My mom (65F) is looking into purchasing one in hopes that it will slow my step dads (68M) memory loss down. He was diagnosed in January. 

Has anybody here had any luck with a hyperbaric chamber?","I had not heard about this until just now, but in case it helps, here is a relatively recent review article about it: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11065-021-09500-9

If you want to look at it further or find ideas in that you want to find out more about, you can refer to the references at the bottom to look at specific studies. 

A lot of times researchers will do literature reviews as part of ramping up a study of their own. So if you like the article (or any other article they included in their review), you could google the authors names (especially first and last authors listed) and see if they have more published work, or even upcoming studies to follow.

Edit: i would exercise caution as nebb1 suggested, especially if there is someone who is trying to convince you to who stands to gain financially from it. There is definitely no shortage of hucksters who want to take advantage of people suffering from chronic illness.

For me personally, i would consider using it if it were part of an IRB approved clinical trial connected to a reputable research group, and participation cane at no added cost to me. And even then, id do a bit of my own research about the risks, and ask a lot of questions about the safety and monitoring of the study.
My father (70) has started these about a month ago. My mother has not noticed any changes, but my assumption is that it's impossible to see improvement, but only to slow down the decline, which can't really be observed... I'm interested to hear more from others on this too!
Unfortunately, this won't make a difference but will cost a fortune.  People will try to use desperation to make a hefty profit in all incurable diseases and Alzheimer's is no different... Please be wary of shady clinics or books/doctors that push for these treatments.

Also if used incorrectly it could lead to lung damage, rupture in middle ear, sinus damage, vision loss, and oxygen poisoning to name a few.

If your father is still early stages, his best bet is likely drug trials such as donanumab and others.
Research Dr. Paul Harch. He’s into this and claims to have reversed or improvised cognition. At the same time I would research Dr. Dale Bredesen and his work, showing improvement patients with a precision medicine approach. 

I am taking this route as it is logical.

Here’s the recent Proof of Concept study:

Alzheimers,My Mom is awful to my Alzheimer’s having Dad,"This is my throwaway, I have gone NC/very low contact with my mother. 

She has hit him/shaken him up pretty bad. Today I was stopping by to pick up some mail that was sent to her house instead of mine and I heard screaming. “I hate you”, “I could kill you”, “you’re an idiot”, “you son of a bitch”. I intervened and she let up but he’s alone with her all day. He was holding his head so I think she hurt him but I didn’t see any obvious marks/bruising. He cannot live with me, our house is too small and I work 13 hours a day so I’m never home and he needs 24 hour care at this point. She locks him in the home, he hasn’t been outside in months. Only goes out for dr appts. 

What can I do? She’s his POA. He has money but she makes him sign over the checks he gets sent in the mail (I believe retirement or social security?). She won’t let me look at anything, nothing from doctors, no paperwork so I’m very limited in what I know besides he doesn’t know who anyone is and can’t take care of himself at all. I’m at a loss. If I call the police on her my dad loses his main caregiver, and she WILL retaliate on my partner and I. She’s always been an awful mother to me, which is why NC happened in the first place. Now that her kids have left her she’s taking out all the anger she used to abuse us, she’s turned onto my Dad. I really am unsure how to approach this situation. Any help is appreciated and hope you all and your loved ones are well.","First, you can report her to adult protective services (make sure you have a recording or two)—it is NOT true he will lose his main caregiver, in fact, like kids get foster homes in abusive situations, the state DOES have services in place to care for the elderly in abusive situations. Best of luck—at least in my state the elderly services care stuff are really, really helpful and supportive.
As a caregiver who does not have unlimited patience, yes, the way your mother is acting towards your father is 100%  inappropriate.  

Period

Full stop.

Caregiving is extremely difficult.  And largely thankless.  And exhausting.

I don't know your mother and father's situation but if she's his only caregiver, or his primary caregiver she may simply need some help.  No one can do it alone.


Now.  I wrote the above before reading the second part of the OP


You have a poor relationship with your mother.  I'd do my best to have a conversation with her and try to be compassionate.  Even if you guys don't get along, even if she was a terrible mother to you, caregiving is still exceptionally hard,  I would try and have a conversation with her.  Tell her you understand that, tell her you will help her get some help in caring for your father.

If you feel you are making any headway with her then continue over time trying to make more headway.

If you're not making headway, or you stop making headway, then, as others have said, you need to report (not her, but) the situation to protective services to protect your father.  He does not deserve that verbal/emotional abuse.
I feel your pain. I have numerous recordings of my a$$hole mother treating my dad awful but playing the martyr to the outside world. I lost my father last October when an emergency happened with her 4 weeks prior looking back I should have left her in the hospital alone and taken my daddy with me to my house to ensure his safety but I followed what she told me to do take him to the VA where he was scared and anxious and ultimately passed away alone. Like the other poster said make sure you have recordings and everything documented. My mom wasn’t legally the POA she somehow got talked into having someone forge my Dads signature onto the POAs. I always said if my Sad passed first I would never speak to that evil witch again- it’s a lot harder than I thought I have guilt but I’m going to push through it!! Protect your Dad at all costs!
Press charges for elder abuse. Figure everything else out after. You will get the help you need. It won’t be easy, but there are groups out there that can help. The police will help you find and contact them.
Take him to the hospital. They should be able to evaluate whether he has any injuries and if they are likely from himself falling compared to being hit. He may have an easier time getting into an appropriate nursing home from the hospital compared to you shopping around.

If your dad has any understanding of what’s happening, even some good days, he can sign a new POA granting permission to you, that overrides the old one.
Are you and your partner able to offer her any respite (taking care of your Dad on a regular basis so that your Mom can get a break)?  This is probably the best thing you can do for your Dad. You won't be with your Mom so that shouldn't be an issue. You can take him out of the house if your Mom does not have plans to leave the home. Can you make the time to do this on a regular schedule that your Mom can rely on?  And can you also provide other help, such as grocery shopping or other errands, house cleaning, or paying for a professional to care for your Dad or do chores to lighten your Mom's load. Rather than framing it as ""Mom, you need help"" you can say that you want to spend time with your Dad. And you can just provide the other help, such as bringing over meals or doing laundry etc., without asking.",2022-05-08 00:50:41,frombehindthelens,ukue9n
Alzheimers,Late-Stage for My Dad,"My dad has been fading from Alzheimer’s / dementia for about 10 years. This last year, he’s faded a lot faster. He had been living at home until toileting issues and agitation became too much for my mom to handle, so we moved him into memory care. His toileting issues got worse, coupled with dehydration from a stomach bug, had us take him to the ER two weeks ago. He was agitated by his roommate, the staff trying to give him medicine and food. I’ve never witnessed it, but I imagine it is more “I don’t know you or why you’re trying to put that in my mouth, step back” rather than more physical violence. He was there four days recovering, came back to memory care, and they called us 45 minutes late. They’d sent him to the local hospital, who then transferred him to mental care facility under a GA1013 involuntary commitment order as “danger to others.”

Do these medical professionals not understand that “my dad doesn’t know where he is or what’s going on” is not the same as “danger to others?”

My mom has only gotten a few updates. This facility does not allow any visitors at all (because it’s where they keep people that are a “danger to others”). He’s just as agitated, dehydrated again, toilet problems continue, not eating or drinking, not “compliant” with taking his medicine.

Until he calms his agitation, relearns the toilet, eats and drinks well, and takes his medicine without complaining, he won’t be cleared for release. The 1013 involuntary commitment expired after 48 hours, so it’s “hospital discharge,” which I suppose we could override if needed. Realistically, there’s no way he’s going to significantly improve in those areas unless they find an incredibly effective combination of medicines, or just heavily sedate him.

It’s worse because my mom’s process of grieving is “accept the things that I can’t change.” I don’t blame her for that, but when I ask her for updates, she’s very brief. On Monday, she even said, “just don’t call or text me for updates anymore, I’ll let you know if anything important happens.” I have the code to call the nurses, but even with the code, it took me nine phone calls to get to a “case worker,” who said that even though I have the code, they will only talk to one family member, which is mom. That was Wednesday morning. Mom said “oh, he’s doing just fine they say.” I had gotten a little information before they shut me down, and they told me about getting IV fluids because he wasn’t eating or drinking, which mom omitted. There’s no other information since Wednesday. She came over to visit my daughter and me today for Mother’s Day, and she didn’t say anything. Didn’t mention his name. She’s changed her phone background so it’s not a picture of her and Dad anymore. I didn’t want to confront her around my daughter or make a stink for Mother’s Day. She can grieve in her way, but I don’t think it’s too much for me to ask for the information and help in his care. I’m paying for all of it. Mom said that they couldn’t really afford the memory care before he even moved in. I said I could help, and so I guess I’ll be getting the bill for two weeks in the hospital, plus what’s to come. 

My mom and dad cared for my grandmother before she died with Alzheimer’s. She never got as bad as Dad is now. He’d say, over and over, just to me, “son, don’t ever let me get like that. Just let me wander off in the woods. Buy me a one-way ticket to Vegas and $100 of chips. Shake my hand and say, ‘see you later, Dad.’”","This sounds really heartbreaking to be going through. I wish we lived in a country where we could honor someone's wishes & bodily autonomy in the face of this disease. 

If your mom in unable or unwilling to continue this journey (and that's understandable, he probably said the same thing to her that he has said to you), ask her to sign over power of attorney, etc. to you. (Hopefully you all have those documents in place already.) Take them to the hospital so they know that you are now the primary caretaker & point of contact. 

Get a copy of his treatment history & list of medications and schedule a consult with his attending physician. In the consult, don't make demands - find out what the options are. He's in a tough spot that it is entirely possible that the only way he can stay in a memory care facility is under extremely heavy sedation. I personally think is incredibly inhumane to prolong someone's life in a drugged, semi-conscious state. Hopefully the doctor will be sympathetic to the fact that what he's experiencing now is traumatic and will help identify the care plan avenues available to your father.

I'm sorry you're going through this.
I’m so sorry that you are going through this. Who had Power of Attorney or legal power over medical decisions? If that is not you, then you may want to remind your mother that you are helping to pay the bills and want to make sure the family isn’t being over charged. You  may want to ask to speak to the had of the social work department.  Explain that you when your dad gets off the “hold” he needs a “sitter” with him. This is a non-medical person whose job is to sit there and talk to the person to help orient them and make sure they don’t hurt themselves like pulling the IV out. If you can’t get anywhere consider calling the state elder abuse office you have a right to see your loved one. Hospitals make exceptions for squeaky wheels - don’t be afraid to make some noise.",2022-05-07 23:12:04,lurkinggrue52dotedu,uksw0c
Alzheimers,choking on food,"my mom is choking a bit on food...Any tips? I would guess more soups, and congee for her to eat, instead of hard solids","She needs to have an evaluation by a speech therapist (SLP-speech language pathologist.) They are experts in swallowing. She can develop aspiration pneumonia from this choking. Please ask her PCP for a referral through a home health agency ASAP.
An SLP would need to evaluate for swallowing and likely suggest changes to diet to include thickeners to watery foods, or even some exercises to strengthen the muscles.
She needs to have a swallow study done by an SLP

-A SLP undergrad
Agree with the others on a swallowing evaluation by an SLP. Some foods you might think are safe (like liquids and soup, and ice cream!), may not be because of aspiration. A swallow test will help inform what her diet should be.
Dad would choke on food because he would either put too much in or not chew properly.

We cut everything up very fine and monitor his eating. We make sure he takes sips of water every few bites.

If she chokes on anything definitely do soups or even blend some food. Nutrition drinks will also be great so she gets the vitamins she needs. 

Maybe check in with her doc if it is a constant issue.
May be time to start switching to protein drinks and Ensure. It only gets worse unfortunately. I use a toddler style sippy cup and mix in almond milk and her meds with a blender mornings and evenings.",2022-05-06 20:00:14,anxietyokra,uk0u29

Alzheimers,Grandpa forgot I was home,"Hi all. I apologize if this is not the right subreddit to post this, but I'm looking for advice. My grandpa has a history of forgetting small things. It's worried my mom a bit, but nothing major has happened... until today.

I live with my grandparents while I go to school because they live much closer to my university than my parents do. I came home around 5:30 this evening (which is earlier than I normally get home) because I had to take an online test for school. When I walked in, my grandpa was sitting in the living room and my grandma was taking shower. My grandpa greeted me with, ""Well, you're home early!"" and I replied by saying, ""Yeah, I have to take a test."" I then just went to my room and took my test.

I can hear their conversations in the living room through the walls in my room. About halfway through my test, I hear my grandma say from the living room, ""It looks like she's almost home. I need to text her to get the mail."" My family uses Life360, so that's how she knew that. I expected my grandpa to tell her I had already come in, but he didn't say anything about me being home. 

After I was finished with my test, I was getting ready to go meet my boyfriend for dinner. Before I rounded the corner to the living room, my grandma said, ""She must be eating dinner in her car or something,"" and my grandpa still didn't say anything about me being home. After I went around the corner, I announced to them that I was going to eat dinner, and they both looked shocked to see me. I understand my grandma, because she wasn't in the room when I came in, but my grandpa should have known I was here. My grandma said, ""Oh, I didn't even know you were home!"" and my grandpa said the same thing. When I said, ""Grandpa, you saw me come in. You talked to me when I walked in the door,"" he was very adamant that he never saw me and didn't know I was here. 

My grandma quickly explained it away without giving me time to fully explain by saying he didn't feel good, but this really struck me as odd. He literally forgot I was home when I had a conversation with him when I walked in. He spoke to me and has no recollection of it. Is this something I should try to talk to my grandma about in private so she can look for further symptoms or am I just reading too much into this? I'm really concerned, as him forgetting I was in the house seems like quite a big deal. Thanks in advance.","It is concerning.  You can try to talk to your Grandma, but I am not sure if she will be receptive since she tried to explain it away.  Maybe, bring it up very casually and mention that certain types of memory loss can be treated to slow down the process.
Talk to your grandma. She is probably concerned too but in denial. That’s her person and she doesn’t want to watch him fade away. Educate yourself about Alzheimer’s, there are many resources free online so you can look for symptoms. Take notes when you notice anything concerning so you can share with your grandma or a doctor.",2022-05-05 22:26:39,GroceryLive4354,ujdcxw

Changing positions is essential.
Usually at the hospital it is the occupational therapist who advises on the best cushion. It may depend on her weight and place of wound.
Yes if these are pressure sores then the pressure needs to be relieved. Your Mom may be unable to move herself or incapable of communicating discomfort. She should have a Roho cushion which helps relieve the pressure when in a wheelchair. [https://www.pressuresorecushions.com/collections/roho-cushions](https://www.pressuresorecushions.com/collections/roho-cushions)

When in bed she needs to be turned every 2 hours. Sometimes due to short staffing, this doesn't happen. Most hospital beds have pressure air relieving functions. If she in a bed like this, be sure the pressure relief is turned on. Some people complain about the air noise and then this feature gets turned off. Also you could ask the Dr for a consult for an ET RN/wound care RN  who have special training to treat wounds.  A barrier cream may only help prevent stool/urine entering the wound but the wrong cream could be making the wound worse.
Bedsores are a difficult problem. To help understand the problem place a clear drinking glass on your palm and press gently. Your skin underneath will turn white. This is from the pressure forcing the blood away from the skin. This lack of blood over repeated long periods of time causes the skin to fail.  This is contributed to by bathroom accidents.  The key is changing positions often.  Use pillows and rolled up towels to prop up legs, keep them on one side and then the other etc.  I attempt for a change every 25 mins.  A cream called Calmo sept one that also helps.  Apply liberally.

I’m allergic to Benadryl and rash creams, it’s something to keep in mind if turning her more often doesn’t help.
The only way to avoid and treat pressure sores is relieving the pressure frequently. There's wheelchairs that tilt, and the things other commenters have already mentioned. Keeping the skin clean, dry and breathing may not be possible due to probable incontinence. 

Depending on the quality of the facility: if you trust that they are in top of it, follow their lead. If you have your doubts they are turning her enough: definitely raise a stink.
i took care of my grandpa that was bedbound due to cancer and i had some issues with sores so i read up on it a lot. i'd recommend https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pressure-sores/, the NHS has some great websites on dealing with health issues. everytime i'm looking up something to do with care, i put in NHS in google search. 

like everyone already said, turning every two hours during the day (we didn't do at night, because waking him wouldn't be worth it - that is actually doctrine, you need to weight the benefits. eg. good uninterrupted sleep can speed up healing). 

if they will start putting her on a bed, you need to get the pressure reliever thing for under the bed (it basically pumps air in and out to change pressure spots, similar to what someone linked you for sitting - it does make a bit of noise though) and lots of cushions, so you can anchor her well. usually need at least one inbetween legs and some to stabilize her back and prevent her from turning over. 

get cavilon cream, apply it on all protruding bones (hips, shoulder, heel, collar bones, etc) after washing in the morning and after washing in the evening. 

if sores have already developed, buy tegaderm hydrocolloid thin dressings and apply to sores. you changes those every 3-5 days, depends on fluid buildup. they sell bandages shaped especially for the sacral area, which i assume she'll need, if you are having issues because of sitting (my grandpa developed those when i was away and my uncle didn't turn him often enough and allowed him to sit up too much). they are expensive, but very much worth the money. hydrocolloids are almost miraculous, i started using them on me too, when i get wounds (or blisters). 

get some tegaderm film as well, it comes in handy to bandage over other things (it's a breathable barrier). 

these are all 3M products.",2022-05-05 15:19:58,anxietyokra,uj4zsz

Alzheimers,Social worker came to the house.,"I've posted here before, but basically my grandma is getting pretty bad. All day has been a battle. It got to the point she was screaming at me that I was the devil himself and that I murdered her whole family and I was gonna go back to hell. Trying to hit me and push me down. We called 911, like we already have before, because we just don't know what to do. She kept going outside and yelling for ""help"" and getting into my grandpa's car and laying on the horn. Ambulance gets there and immediately says she needs to go to the hospital at least to ""get away from the devil"" and calm her down, i apologized for if we had wasted their time and the one I was talking to said he would've done the same. But, of course, a Social Worker shows up right when all this is happening and says she's very concerned about my grandmother's wellbeing and possibly being abused. 
Needless to say I am absolutely terrified. The social worker said we aren't in trouble at all but it's still scary, I'm not sure what to do or if we can do anything. She's set up to be placed in a memory care unit on next Wednesday but... I can't even explain how horrifying this is. We have a caseworker for the placement stuff and she already 100% knows how she is as she's came to the house and saw her get like this. I'm just so scared. I've done everything I could to take care of her. And now apparently social services thinks we are abusive...","We were flagged by  social worker once.  Just repeat clearly what was happening, thar she has deteriorated and you are waiting for memory care.  

If she makes you meet with a social worker, just stay calm, stick to your guns and say what she was doing. Never go off script.  After a month they have tobclise the case.

This SW sounds like s/he I'd swinging the big power dick.

Hang in there.
No, no.  Don't worry.  They are just doing their job.  If your caseworker has witnessed these episodes, that's good objective evidence that this is your grandmother's disease.  In the unlikely event you had to defend yourself, you could call an expert witness from geriatric psychiatry to attest that this is how people sometimes get in dementia.
The social worker is being a dick. She should be offering resources to help you and your grandma, not making vaguely threatening statements about abuse when obviously your grandmother has Alzheimer’s. 

Don’t worry. Just explain what happened. Some important details are:
- She has Alzheimer’s.
- She is awaiting memory care. 
- She was having a difficult day and **no longer recognized you.** She believed you were the *actual* devil and wanted you to descend back down to hell. 
- If they have specifics about how she screamed at you that you murdered her whole family, note that you ARE her family.
- She wanted help escaping from the devil and sending him back down to hell. 
- YOU, not your grandma, called 911, because you didn’t know how to calm her down and **needed help.**
- Instead of helping, the social worker made threatening statements about abuse, which was incredibly unhelpful when you and your grandmother could have used some actual help. She offered no resources, suggestions for support groups, information about adult daycare/respite care, or any other information that would have been helpful and appropriate. Alzheimer’s is a difficult enough disease without someone adding more anxiety without offering a shred of support or help for you or your grandma. 

I doubt social services thinks you’re abusive. That social worker may have been a dick, but that doesn’t mean anything will happen or that you’ll be in any trouble. She may force some kind of interview, but you have done nothing wrong and don’t need to worry.
Social workers have such concern because by experience that is what happens quite often, unfortunately. She might not just being a dick.

I understand your situation, in his final days my father was like that, and he attacked his caregiver...we were all so full of anguish and fear, and we were lost because we did not know what to do.

Everything passes, better days are ahead...
Omgosh so sorry you experienced that, it's very hard, so sad.    That social worker was horrendous.  Idk if you could put in a complaint about that. I mean, basically you were suffering a kind of domestic violence abuse incident perpetrated *against you*, and that idiot came along and without any context whatsoever nor understanding or insight to dementia just steamed into you.  So sorry.  Idk why that social worker had a bee in their bonnet about elder abuse today.   I hope you can access some carers counselling / therapy to help you?  I feel for you!   \* hugs \*
You may need to get a conservatorship/guardianship order from the court. If she has to go into a memory care facility, it will come out of her estate and the cost is insanely expensive think 5 figures every month. Only a probate judge can determine her competency. Talk to an attorney who specializes in Elder care.
That’s scary, but it’ll be ok! I used to work at elder protective services until recently. Generally, they should say they received a report of concern, but they shouldn’t have outright said they were concerned you were abusing her. Could be an inexperienced worker. Either way, that’s just semantics and you will be fine.

From your report here, I can see why a report was filed. Your grandma is what we would call “at risk” - the biggest concern is her being able to get out of the house without anyone noticing. On paper, that would be considered possible neglect to be investigated. In my state, they do a 30 day investigation to find out what’s going on and how the incident is being handled. The thing is- these things happen and most people don’t know what to do. It doesn’t sound like she got hurt in any way and you’re taking the appropriate steps to get her the help she needs to be safe. That’s really all that matters.

The social worker will probably be involved for a little while until she settles into the memory care unit and be there to help you through the process. After the investigation, they’ll give you some tips on how to handle these things and other resources for how to care for grandma. You’re not going to get in trouble or charged with anything. Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any!",2022-05-04 17:39:31,precious_mentality,uihaw2
Alzheimers,(TW: SA) Mum keeps being taken advantage of by male residents in her care home.,"Just off the phone with a member of staff from the home that my mum's in. She called to inform us of an incident that happened today involving a male resident trying to grab her crotch whilst she was walking down the corridor. This is the same male resident who was caught masturbating in front of her a couple of months ago, but not the same one who doggedly followed her around and was found several times alone with mum in her room last year, trying to kiss her whilst his penis was out (this gentleman was removed from the home soon after this series of events). 

I'm so sick of this happening. Two different male residents have now taken advantage of her and I am so angry and sick to my stomach that she's had this happen to her. Luckily she hasn't noticed it or been phased by any of it but still, it shouldn't be happening. I don't care that the male residents also have dementia and may not be aware of what they're doing.

My mum's young but her Alzheimer's is very advanced. She's 64 and physically still very fit and mobile, but this makes her the most vulnerable person in the home because it's so easy for her to wander into a corridor or room out of eyesight of a member of staff. 

I can't blame the staff. They're all lovely and they all do their best but these things just take a minute to happen, and they can't be expected to keep sight of every single resident every single minute of the day. There's nowhere near enough staff for that and even if there were, it still only takes that minute of being out of sight. 

I hate that this is happening to the woman who used to be my mum. Every day is spent with anxiety, dreading another call from the home to say that something's happened to her again. She's supposed to be safe in there, for fuck sake.","So very sorry this is happening to your mom. I don't know how to start approaching that; but I'm just here to say I'm sorry and that's awful. I wonder if there are any homes specifically for men or women? Or maybe places that keep men and women on separate floors or in separate corridors? 
I hope you find a solution somehow. It's definitely not fair for your poor mom.
Limited staffing isn’t an excuse. I’ve been a caregiver for several years, working both in-home and at facilities in different roles, and have a lot of experience with this. It’s avoidable if the staff is trained and do their job. It is our responsibility to know where residents are at all times, especially those who are door seekers/wanderers and those who display sexual behaviors. The director/manager or whoever is in charge of the memory care should make it a point to protect your mother and ensure that other residents aren’t alone with her or able to take advantage of her. Head counts, room checks, etc, are simple ways to avoid this. Any director/manager worth their salt would hold a team meeting and remind the staff that write-ups are to be expected if your mother isn’t looked after, especially if it’s a repeated offense.

It’s so important for family members/friends to advocate and fight for their loved ones, and holding the director/manager responsible is one way of doing it. Obviously honey works better than vinegar, but if these kind of incidents continue to take place, then you need raise a bit of hell.

And to those who think or say it’s unavoidable don’t know what they are talking about. I’ve helped put together care plans and strategies to prevent male residents from having these kind of incidents, so long as they are followed and repeated. Unfortunately family/friends don’t realize that things are different when they aren’t visiting: care staff often put on an act when you are there, but are really lazy and neglectful when you leave. As lovely as some caregivers can be, the general rule is that they are one of or a combination of being young, inexperienced, and not really caring. This has been my experience working in, visiting, and consulting with countless facilities across the states.
So sorry that happened.  My mother had bruises up and down her arm from a male resident (memory care) that got scared and took it out on my mother who was trying to help him.  I can understand your anxiety, I still break out in a cold sweat when the Caller ID shows the care facility's number.  My mother has been in memory care for about a year and I've had to change her medication cocktail a few different times because of inappropriate behavior so I have a little bit more of a forgiving attitude about the incident.  I harbor no resentment to the male resident that hurt my mother, it is a disease.  However, if there was no attempt to calm the behavior through medication or other means by that resident's family, I would certainly raise hell.
Oh gosh, so sorry.  It's really difficult, I feel for you, and yr mum!
The home should be putting in appropriate safeguardings, and you can report them. They need to look at either moving your mum to somewhere more appropriate or moving the men, and I think the men would be the best option as they may pose a threat to other residents. If not, you could also involve the police to get the care home to act, they probably won't charge the men depending on their mental capacity, but you'll have a police incident number and safeguardings to will have to be put in place.",2022-05-04 08:38:42,TubbyLittleTeaWitch,ui5m94
Alzheimers,Advice on keeping contact with affected family member long distance?,"My grandmother has been diagnosed and is unfortunately rapidly declining. The decision has been made for her to relocate to Texas close to my Aunt at assisted living. 

She has never been tech savvy. Doesn’t have a smart phone. She had a laptop but now struggles very hard to use it and really only used it for bills prior. 

I am wondering if anyone has had any advice on keeping contact? 

I plan to send her small gifts on occasion but was thinking that writing her letters may do some good but don’t want to fluster her.","Greeting cards can be a nice conversation starter for assisted living staff if your grandmother displays them in her room. They also have nice pictures she would enjoy even as she loses language. If you send photos, label them on the back, not just with names but with how the person is related to her.
Phone calls work and they will help make her day better.

She may not remember that you called, but she will (hopefully) still have those happy feelings from talking to you.
You can make short little films that anyone can show her with an iPhone - make sure they say their name, etc - you could give her a phone just to use for that. In yr little “movie” you can reminisce abt times you shared and/or show pictures. I love it that you want to stay in touch!
Our LTC home has ipads that they use to set up facetime for the residents with any friend or family who wants to call.
You can call the nurse and they give the phone to her to talk with you, and then they take it back afterwards. This works with my relative well. I hope the best for you and your mom.
So I’m in a lucky situation where my mom or sister who visits her 2-3 days a week call me so I can speak to her. This allows my family from being trapped (my grandma has lost her time perception and actively procrastinates when we are trying to leave) and my grandma doesn’t need to use the phone. 

If you don’t have family members, maybe try talking to her caregivers and say “hey could you call me at 5 pm on Mondays and Wednesdays so I can speak with her.” Even if you’re not free every time a call is made, atleast there can be some routine and you can plan around those times to the best of your ability. Having someone call VS relaying on them makes the communication way easier.

In terms of the gift sending, my grandma needs constant reminders of who she’s receiving cards from.  She thinks no one visits or sends her items anymore even though all the cards she gets are displayed for her to look at. I will always send her a holiday card or a few photos but I no longer expect any thank you or even acknowledgements as she can’t remember/doesn’t understand.
Amazon Echo Show in my mom’s room, let’s me drop in and chat with her, or turn on the camera to check on her.
Get her a flip phone.  Most older people can use those and just call her every day.  I call my Dad every single day on my way to work.  He forgets it five minutes later but remembers the general feeling.  They say that those with Alzheimer's won't remember the actual conversation or interaction but will remember how it made them feel so I'll call him every day until he can't answer the phone anymore even if it is just me talking.",2022-05-03 20:57:36,toledotrev,uhuq8p
Alzheimers,Mom and Money,"My mom closed her long standing bank account and opened a new bank. She neglected to have all the automated payments and deposits switched over.

My sister is the executor of her trust and has power of attorney. 

We her children were put on her bank account and we all worked to fix the problem.

However my mom opened another account at the current bank and has a history of withdrawals of large amounts.

What can be done to prevent her from doing this?","Nothing, it's her money and her bank account.... Especially if she can still drive herself around. Unless you are ready for an intervention. At that point, take her ID and bank cards. 

With my mom we did it a little more subtly, we were taking her everywhere anyway, so we had our own bank cards for her account. One day her cards were 'lost', and ever since then we've been the only ones with direct access.
Move her money to a trust to which she is not the trustee.

Edit: this situation should be addressed to an attorney
My sister was able to show her POa and moms diagnosis to her bank to avoid this.
Give her fake money ? My grandmother was doing this but whatever money she has kept is hidden among her belongings and on her own person.  They also talked with the people at the bank and let them know the situation. That seem to improve things",2022-05-03 14:49:35,tvalone2,uhmziu
Alzheimers,Was power washing today something me and dad used to do together,"So was power washing my back yard today and I almost felt him their hes only gone four weeks he fought his fight since 2014. 

Was the youngest of three so even at 44 its still hard for me to process it still.","There is no age at which losing a parent is easy. For me, even though my mom had Alzheimer’s  and I grieved the loss of the parent child relationship we had - the finality of losing her completely was still devastating. It’s been 3 months and it’s hard when I do things we used to do together.
You say you almost felt him there. Maybe he was, just like old times. 💫
Sorry for your loss. I lost my dad 3 weeks ago as well.
he will always be in your heart and your memories . my sympathy for you as I  too lost my mom recently.",2022-05-03 15:33:13,davidb43ni,uhnxh8
Alzheimers,Question about speed of decline,"I've written about my wife (70 F) diagnosed 3 years ago and it seems that within the last month or so her memory is failing faster then I'm used to.  I mentioned it to her Dr's but they didn't seem overly concerned.  Today she said ""check out the nice horse walking down the street"" it was a dog then about 20 minutes later she said ""there's a cute Penguin on the lawn"" and it was a bird!!!!  We both laughed at both of her mistakes knowing it was really kind of funny BUT she really is going downhill at a faster pace then she has been during the last 3 years.  I'm assuming it's not going to ever get better and praying it just slows down again.","Have her checked for a UTI, or other infection.  UTI’s are dirt common in older women. 

My mother has Alzheimer’s, and every time she has a medical condition, her mental ability takes a scary nosedive. Once the medical condition is resolved, it gets much better.
Not an expert, just a fellow traveler.  My husband has declined noticeably in the past 6 months, now needs help with dressing, believes preposterous things (says he was at the original celebration of statehood, which was well over 100 years ago, when in fact he and his parents celebrated the centennial - so he says he was at both!), misidentifies things like you're describing.  They say the Alzheimer's drugs such as Aricept or Namenda are most helpful at delaying symptoms, in the early stages of the disease.  He's still taking Namenda but I doubt it is doing any good.",2022-05-02 23:39:27,bartlask,uh7b1x
Alzheimers,Keeping track,"My mother has early onset and has begun to hallucinate various elaborate scenarios and has wandered away from my parents home on two occasions so far.  She also periodically loses me in her mind, so she doesn’t realize she’s walking next to me in public.  This leads to her wandering away and if I’m busy watching my son or distracted in any way she can get away from us.  

We are working very hard to prolong the time we care for her, but a care facility is a certainty.  Toward that end we are looking for ways to keep track of mom.  The best fit I’ve found so far is an Apple Watch with cell service on my dads account so he can see her location as long as she’s wearing it.  She’s pretty consistent about wearing her watch today. Hoping that having the grandkids on the face will be enough to keep her wearing it.

Are there better options for this? Has anyone tried this and been successful?","New devices that your family member isn't used to are often removed. Also the watch could easily be taken from her. I have no clue how the apple tiles work. But maybe it could fit on or in her shoe. My dad never removed his shoes. 

Honestly prevention is the best solution. Dad went through a period of wandering off. It was so tiring. So we put some of those toddler door covers on the door handles and we attached slide locks at the base of the doors. We would unlock them with our toes and he never noticed them to unlock.

And when we were out we just made sure he stayed in our eyesight at all time. If there was more than one of us then we communicated who was to keep eyes on him. I often was able to keep him still by having him push the cart at the grocery store and I kept a hand or foot on it.

Eventually this phase will pass. You just have to be inventive.
If she carries a bag or you could get her to carry one you could put the watch or a tracker in there and use that as well if she starts to remove the watch. An apple air tag may be able to be clipped into pants or a jacket if she wears one as well. I'm sorry you are going through this, a care facility can be daunting but the relief of knowing she is taken care of and safe is a big weight off your shoulders.
My father in law has a medical alert necklace, so I added an AirTag to it.  It updates as often as it comes in contact with another apple user, but he lived next to a college campus so it works.  The nice thing about it is it doesn’t require charging.

I watch him on my phone and intercept him if he stops moving for too long.",2022-05-02 17:08:28,ndecizion,ugzrxk
Alzheimers,Experiences with adult social services?,"Can anyone share their experience with calling adult services on a parent with Alzheimer’s? 

Right now, my parents are in failing health and  don’t have any savings to their name. My mother is mentally ill, a lifelong alcoholic, and now has an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. 

I (30f) am completely overwhelmed and would like to hear from those who have any information on what services adult services can provide for memory care, etc.","My sister called social services when we couldn't get my mom to move into a facility voluntarily.   They weren't much help.  They said they only intervern if there is abuse.  Hope it works out better for you.
I think it varies from state to state. 7 or so years ago my mom ( in Colo) fell and the doctor had social service check in on her. We were told she couldn’t be left alone . I stayed with her for a 6 weeks or so until we found a place for her. In the meantime they provided some physical rehab for her and had a nurse check in weekly.",2022-05-02 14:22:26,creynolds092,ugw3e9
Alzheimers,Need advice. Dad decided to put Mom into a memory care facility.,"My brother and I are totally on board with this.  It’s time.  Next Monday, I’m going to have to go to the place and move her in.  Then we have to get Dad out of there and get him home to an empty house.  Just wondering if anyone has experience with this.  When is it time to leave the facility?  When is it time to leave him at home?  What on earth do you say?","So, we left my dad with his home caregiver who took him out for the day so he didn't see us packing anything. We then took everything to the facility and set it up before he arrived. 

When he arrived we were vague and told him the house needed some repairs and we got him this cute place with his things for him to stay in for a bit and that people were here to help him if he needed anything. 

When it comes time to leave, I'd have a staff member on standby to redirect them so they don't try and follow you. My brother and I then went and got a beer to deal with the guilty feeling because my dad did have a moment of recognition that we were leaving him there. 

As for your dad, maybe once you get back to the house ask if he'd like you guys to spend the night while he acclimates. Get his honest feelings and maybe set up a plan of visiting him and visiting your mom. I will say it is nice to go visit at the facility with someone because it can be uncomfortable. Not to say visiting your mom would be uncomfortable, but you will now have other residents and caregivers to consider as well. Having the support of a group just makes it feel less weird.
It sucked. It felt strange leaving my mother someplace and even stranger dropping him off at his house. I can’t really remember what we talked about. We both knew it sucked and I think we didn’t really touch on the matter too much on the way back home. 

What I can say is this. Your mother is being taken care of. Your dad comes back to find his life turned upside down. Keep an eye out for him. My father didn’t land well at all and he had trouble just doing life on his own. I realized that late and that left us with a messy situation. We got out of it alright but a lot of things could’ve been avoided. Just remember to be there for him. Also, good luck with the whole situation. I hope thing’s will go smooth and your family finds peace with it all.
I met my mom at the facility to drop off my dad. Because of Covid only two ppl could go in. But my brother lives about 10 hours away so he wasn’t going to be there anyway. One of her sisters drove with her but waited in the car. We couldn’t stay long again because Covid. We couldn’t even go in with him last the main office. It fucking sucked. 

And I basically just took a long lunch break to do it because I work in child care and we are severely understaffed and I couldn’t bring my child and don’t have alternate care so it had to be during his school hours. 

My mum and aunt went to lunch with another of their sisters. Or to her house. They didn’t really have a plan but she had their company. 

That was last year and he just passed last month. It’s been absolute hell trying to juggle being the sole caregiver for my own child, missing as little work as possible because I get shit time off and live paycheck to paycheck, and being there for my mom. 

We’ve done a lot of FaceTime and phone check ins to make sure my mom isn’t too lonely. 

I don’t know if any of that was helpful. But I guess I just wanted to say that it is a very very hard thing for you and your family to go through. There’s no perfect or magic way to do it. Just be there for each other when you can. And if it feels hard or any of you are struggling with it, it doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong.
..don't forget your Dad needs to grieve...

so sorry..
I feel for you all, it's tough.  My mum is still at home with me, but half dozen of my cousins have gone through this.  They're all different, depends on the persons. 

  Could you make dinner / breakfast date with yr dad for the day / day after, following days?   So his first meals alone are not alone.   

If he doesn't already have a pet, is there possibility you could get yr dad a rescue-doggo, or kitty?  Old ones, whose owners have had to go residential or passed away, and have lost their owner. A pet gives phenomenal benefit & comfort to those partners who are now alone at home.  Changes everything.  Even if the person says they don't want one, invariably, if/when they get one, they love it & want it to stay.  In my experience, most pet shelters give a sort of 'cooling off period', so if the doggo/kitty doesn't actually work out for whatever reason, you can take it back without undue hassle.  Like, sorry for the animal to return to shelter, but if it doesn't work out then best return it for it to find it's best fit home.  

Maybe help yr dad find some activities/clubs/volunteering to get involved with?  He's very possibly out of the loop, so to speak?  Some folk bounce up immediately to a happy fulfilled social life, some retreat & suffer from grief, guilt, depression, loneliness.

Maybe help him Marie Kondo the place, spring clean / refresh the home a little?  

Best of luck!
My mom quickly declined from memory care to nursing home.  YMMV.  For about a year my mom would forget how to get back to her apartment, would soil herself, forget to turn off water, stove you name it.  Finally after my dad found her on the floor after a fall for the 5th time we decided to move her to memory care.  She lasted a day and a half in memory care before having seizures and she never was even close to being cogent after that seizure (we think stroke).  She was walking one day, then Seizure/stroke, then not walking and not making sense/mumbling.  She lasted about 8 months in a GREAT nursing home, before she passed.  I miss her greatly but the pain of the whole ordeal really made me realize how much we are fortunate that this didnt drag on for years. (in the nursing home).
Make sure they are about caring for your father and not focused solely on management of him. 

The home I put my mother in I’ve already had to slap their hand on all the extra meds they was wanting her on for her to stay at this facility. Also found out they was using their own Dr. to get around my mothers primary care physician for the drugs the nurse at the home wanted her on. 

Good luck and watch the home like a hawk. This was the worst decision I let my family talk me into. I would have been better having her cared for at her own home.",2022-05-02 12:50:52,Recampb,ugu0w1
Alzheimers,Do you become who you always were?,"My dad was a verbally abusive person for as long as I can remember. He would use terrible slurs and yell at curse at us and anyone who disagreed with him. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s at 57. I know sometimes those symptoms manifest for years before a diagnosis. Something I’ve noticed is that while he has forgotten how to do most things and now lives in a nursing home, he always maintained being verbally aggressive. He still screamed and cursed at my mom and sister, and the caretakers who would come to our house before he was placed. No matter what mix of medication he was on, he still maintained those curse words and racism he always had. I know aggression can be part of the confusion but the doctors, caretaker and nurses where he is now say that he’s one of the most verbally abusive patients they’ve seen. Do you think as the disease progresses, you become a caveman instant type of personality you always were? I know of so many of those with Alzheimer’s who are quiet, kind and soft spoken and were good people beforehand. I was just wondering if you become more of a version of the type of person you always were.","I kind of think so:

My mom's most important thing to her her whole life were her kids.

Now that she is fairly far along, seeing us is the thing that gives her the most joy.
In my own limited experience i don't think that this is the case, i think Alzheimers manifests more as people finding conversational and behavioral loops.

 with my dad he has very repetitive conversations with each of the peole he interacts with regularly.

In your case in sounds like unfortunately many of those loops includes some abusive behaviour
In a certain way I think you are right. My mom was always very much in control and knew best. Now that she don't know what is going on around her, she still tries to correct everyone and tell them what to do.
But in some other ways she has changed so much. She was never mean but now she can be very mean. There is just no filter of negative things. And she use to be a very positive person, now it is just negativity and suspicion.
Whilst all types of dementia can affect the brain in very different ways some of the more common symptoms are the lowering of inhibitions and the area of the brain that holds curse/racist words can be left unchanged even if speech and word finding are: in other words a combative, sexist and racist person could become even more so as the disease progresses.
My personal thought, not backed up by anything other than my own observations and worldview. There is no ""true self."" We are a conglomerate of different tendencies and temperaments. In a healthy mind, we use what is most appropriate to the situation, what is accepted in our social environment, and what we have trained ourselves to reach for to solve a problem. 

Example: a few days ago, someone wrote me an email that angered the crap out of me, on a business matter. My first impulse was to send a hot-headed response telling the writer to piss off.

I forwarded the email (and my response) to an associate who justifiably needed to know about the conversation. But my response itself was temperate, assuming good intentions—although I didn't really know the intentions of the writer. There was arguably (from previous interactions) some passive aggressive stuff in the email the writer sent. The bcc'd associate confirmed that the writer's email could have been hostile, and praised me for patience.

Which was the real me? The hot-head or the patient responder? I would prefer to think the latter. But actually, I believe that these two parts of me were in a dynamic relationship with each other. I made a reasoned choice, based on the outcome I hoped for. It worked; peace was achieved. 

In a mind that cannot perform this self-reflexive balancing act, cannot grapple with interpersonal cause and effect (Alzheimer's, which I'm watching unfold in my 25-year life partner) the hot-head would likely have won out. 

Alzheimers destroys or disables brain cells, or connections among brain cells. What it destroys, to the best of my understanding, is random. It may destroy the best parts of the mind, or the worst, or some mix.
Instinct* not instant
Personality is a combination of innate tendencies and learned ones.  Personality can be defined as the stable traits a person has throughout the lifespan.  While I believe in the confusion and fear of late stage dementia, a nice person can become aggressive, I also think that by and large, the person you were remains.  This is from my personal observations and stories I hear in my caregiver support group (dementia specific).
I really think you become the truest unfiltered version of you
I think it has more to do with the loss of higher brain function and inhibitors. So I can see how it would seem like they are becoming a ""baser"" self because they aren't able to reason out situations any longer. In your dad's case he never had that social filter so it isn't surprising he would continue being abusive in that manner. 

My dad never cursed while he was able bodied and now when he's frustrated, since he doesn't know how else to communicate agitation, he'll throw out curse words instead. In his other mannerisms though, he's actually become a much gentler person. 

The brain is so complex and its frustrating how little we still know about it!",2022-05-01 21:10:17,rge703,uge4uz
Alzheimers,A wake up call for a 24 year old,"Hi folks! I was born with my great grandmother having already lost who she was due to Alzheimer’s, so from an early age I knew about the disease. I have now watched my grandmother dissolve away, and now she doesn’t know she has children, let alone grandchildren. I am watching my aunt, her caretaker, suffering from burn out fatigue with a fear of her being next to succumb to the disease. The next step is to place my grandmother in a home just like her mother. 

I turn 24 this month, and fuck, I feel like my whole world just said “it’s time to live your life before you potentially lose yourself.” It’s time to enjoy my time with my father before he potentially loses himself. I bought the book “The subtle art of not giving a f*ck” to help kickstart my campaign of living. I am moving across my state, I am starting a new job, and I am moving in with my loving boyfriend. Watching my loved ones be so confused is so heartbreaking, and yet, I feel so invigorated to LIVE. I understand that there is the potential I don’t have the disease, but I don’t want to take the chance. 

Shout out to everyone who is taking care of their loved ones, you deserve the world.","When my grandmother died a few years after my grandfather's retirement, I decided I wasn't going to wait until I retired to live

I'm poor as shit.  I've lived in 7 countries  New York City and Washington DC.  I've jumped out of an airplane. I've been on the radio and a TV show and in a movie. I've seen the Northern Lights and the Southern Cross.  I've saved a life and seen someone die.  I've hung from hooks pierced throw my skin.  

And, now, I'm caring for my grandfather who has Alzheimer's.  

Yeah, live while you have the chance.  Tomorrow isn't guaranteed.
I also read that book and enjoyed it and it’s sequel. I think it’s important for you to enjoy and live your life at that young age. I also wanted to ease your mind weather you could inherit the disease. I just watched a video from UCTV on the stages of Alzheimer’s. They said only 24% of cases had 2 or more relatives who had it and only 1% was a specific genetic gene . they believe its not worth getting tested for that gene. But that is their opinion. I saw the video on YouTube if you want to check it out . It’s medically oriented so I skipped some of it.

edit : wanted to add that if you are concerned there are lots of articles and books about eating well and lifestyle choices that can improve your mind. Wishing you the best.
This honestly makes me so happy. You deserve it !! I'm 27 and currently a caregiver for my mom who is 63 and in the later stages. I've been doing this for 3 years. My boyfriend and I have been together 7 years and we are exhausted at this point. I feel like I'm getting robbed of the life I want to live. It's so unfair.. We've been getting serious about a 2 year plan so we can continue our lives together. I feel so guilty but I know it's time.. Please enjoy your time. Take advantage. Don't just exist but actually LIVE. Sending so much love!!",2022-05-01 19:01:05,nutbutpicklesammy,ugbq8r
Alzheimers,im scared im starting to hate my father,im 17 and my dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about a year ago. he'll sometimes have these emotional outbursts where he'll call my mom and me names (or homophobic slurs in my case). i know there's not really a way to get him to stop given his mental state and i know it's not really him saying it but does anyone have any advice for dealing with this on my end bc at this point i struggle to be around him at all.,"I’m so sorry you have to deal with this at such a young age. I am (f 66) and my husband has episodes like that. He can berate me for hours and if I try to leave he just gets angrier. Im trying to get him into some meds . I hear they can help. Maybe your Mom can talk to his doctor about his behavior. As for you I wish I had a magic answer . Being treated that way from someone you care about really hurts. try your best to keep it in your mind that you are not what he calls you. It’s ok to feel that you hate him some days. They are your feelings acknowledge them and don’t feel guilty about them. As people say this disease is a roller coaster of emotion. Love yourself and give your mom a hug. I hear sitting outside in nature can help people feel calmer. maybe take a break and watch the clouds float by.
Meds can definitely help. I'm so sorry that your father is treating this way and I want you to know that you're a very big person for recognizing that it's the disease and not him. Please don't hate yourself for having these feelings. It's a terrible disease especially when they get mean. Just know that there's a whole community here who have been or are going through the same thing and that you're not alone.
I know this is hard - and horrible. I'm sorry your dad has this disease. I'm sure he would be appalled if he knew what he was doing - but he doesn't. 

My mother about a year ago decided that I was the enemy. A liar, a b\*t(h, etc. We always had a great relationship and this was NOT normal. It was so hard to hear, and to see her face when she would let loose with the awful stuff. I had to keep reminding myself that my mother, for all intents and purposes, was gone. Or at least there were two of her. ""Mean"" mom and ""regular"" mom. 

I hope you and your mother have the support of his doctors. Finding another adult person who understands how to deal with this like a therapist or a school counselor would be really helpful. Feel free to ""hide out"" when you need to, and take care of yourself. This is a difficult road but your father wouldn't want it to hurt you.
I don't have any advice but i was in a similar situation when I was your age. My dad was diagnosed when i was a freshman in hs, and he kept ransacking my room and making unreasonable, paranoid demands. He didn't directly insult me, but he kept insinuating that i was a slut for not coming back right after school (i was in math league and community service clubs), and did straight up start calling my mom a f*cking whore. They got into insane, cyclical screaming fights that made no sense, and i locked myself in my room to avoid it but he kept trying to break down the door several times a day, so i just had to let him in, trash my room, then he'd leave. He never hit me though, and I knew it was the Alzheimer's. 

I think I hated the situation.. but I didn't hate my dad. I think i felt sorry for my dad. I thought of him as someone who was really sick, and the worse he got, the closer to the end I knew it was. So I actually tried to be *nice* to him. Like spending time with him, playing cards, asking him questions about his past, asking him for help with simple stuff to keep him occupied. I won't lie, it wasn't a rosy time. His response was psychologically punishing more times than it was rewarding. Like hed respond with my attempts to connect with straight up hostility, accusations, angry defensiveness sometimes. But I was able to keep it in my mind that it was the disease, and not him. I could remember what he was like before, and imagine what his ""before Alzheimer's version"" would do or say if he could have seen what was happening. I think he would have protected me, and defended me. But bc of Alzheimer's, he was trapped and couldn't do anything to stop. 

So... It sucked but, as he progressed, he became more docile, and i was after to forgive what happened. I could see it as a circumstance of disease, and not him. Then when he died, i felt ok that my mom and I tried our best. 

Sorry man, not the most cheerful response. But you can get through it.
My dad is currently in memory care with Alzheimer's. (I am older -- 52, and my dad is in his 70's. Also, I was not living with him, so I want to make sure you know that I don't know how hard it must be for you to live with your dad during his decline.) My dad went through a tough couple of years with high anxiety, paranoia, combativeness, anger, and sadness/depression. One thing that was helpful for me to remember when he yelled (or did or said other things that were hurtful or troubling) is that it wasn't him talking/acting. It was the Alzheimer's. I know still that my dad, during his healthy years, would not have said or did the things he was doing during his decline.

Some medications helped some with his mood, but in the end, at least in our case, my dad's disease progressed out of that angry, worried, sad phase, and he entered into a more placid, peaceful space, and is now, for the most part, doing okay.

Keep in mind that your dad is now battling this disease, and it's the disease doing those things. Never feel bad that you are struggling with how to reformulate how you view your father. It's completely natural that you would really start to resent what the disease is doing to your family. Take care of yourself and share how you're doing with loved ones and friends. I'm sorry to hear you're going through it. There just isn't one good thing about this awful disease. It's a terrible way to lose someone you love.

No. It’s hard on adult children when this happens but it’s certainly not guaranteed for you. You can’t decide against children bc you statistically might develop [insert any disease]. If you and your spouse want to bring life into the world, do it. I don’t know what your relationship was like with your father, but most parents want their children to also have children and experience that joy. Just a thought, I’m so sorry you lost him so young.
So sorry! Ask your primary physician for a referral for genetic testing.  [https://www.labcorp.com/tests/630557/early-onset-alzheimer-s-ngs-diagnostic-test](https://www.labcorp.com/tests/630557/early-onset-alzheimer-s-ngs-diagnostic-test)
Yes, I would but you have to make your own decision about the issue.  I always want to know as much possible info as I can but not everyone does.

My grandpa's hobby through out his life was painting (and other creative artsy things), and I tried to create a dementia friendly art desk. I'm not sure if I really accomplished that well lol. Labeling the drawers with what's inside didn't really help. If he can't see it in front of him, he can forget where something is. But he's already cracked out one painting of a viking ship ahaha and I think he might attempt the leprechaun next

Love it.  He is a talented guy, and very lucky to have such a thoughtful grandchild.
Thoughtful idea of you to do this.

Your grandfather seems very skilled. He must have spent a lot of time painting in his life, which makes your gift of enabling him to keep doing his hobby even more thoughtful and kinder. May he continue painting for a long time!

I’ve got stew for every meal tomorrow.,"I don't know if this would work but you could try food processing that stew so that it ends up looking a little bit like beans on toast. 

When my dad wasn't chewing but could still swallow my mom made his meals drinkable, like a soup. Same food, diff look. I know it sounds gross but it worked, and she didn't have to make 2 separate meals.
There's also freezing portions in freezer zipper bags.  Comes in real handy when you're short on time.

Alzheimers,Trying so hard sometimes to not get upset with my mom,"Just venting.

My mom has Alzheimer's and is only 67 years old. She lives alone in a different town a couple hours away. It is so tough to help her manage her house with all the things that need repairing. I don't get the full story from her, she goes and tries to solve these problems herself, doesn't remember that I've told her I'll deal with it. A month ago she bought a new tv cause her current bedroom tv ""wasn't working"" (I told her it was, she had just unhooked the cable box). Last week had a guy out to fix her roof shingles, and now she says she is looking at the back of the house and he didn't fix any. Did you tell him to fix shingles at the back of the house or only the front? Did you not look at the work before paying him (with support worker present).

I am trying to remind myself that I should be asking more questions and not assuming her abilities today are the same as last week. It's just exhausting and frustrating, and I feel bad that sometimes my initial reaction is wanting to just shout what the hell mom, this is so simple! :(","Sorry, I know this sucks, and it's so hard to be at a distance and feel largely helpless. I hate to say it, but it sounds like she may need more supervision than she's currently getting; it does sound like you rather than she should be talking to anybody doing anything around the house.  How often is the support worker there? Have you seen a certified elder law attorney, and do you have POA and medical POA in order? I'm concerned that she's vulnerable to being taken advantage of financially here.
Fasten your seat belt - you're in for a bumpy ride.

It gets more challenging than this.  But your patience will grow, too.

You, and other family members, will probably need to be thinking of next steps soon.  It may not be necessary right now, but at some point it won't be safe for your mother to live alone.
It's going to get worse. Be prepared. I feel like she needs to start getting care inside her home or she needs to move in with you or next door in an in-law type suite. 

I would start to realize that nothing you say anymore will make sense to her. It's not like talking to a rational person who understands you. She is slipping away and you can get frustrated at something she can't even help but **do not take it out on her.** It may look like she's totally competent or capable of rational and lucid but she isn't. The more you realize that the more it's easier to understand her, be patient, and have compassion. 

You know when a toddler has a temper tantrum because you won't let them eat the food that's been sitting in the trash and they don't understand why and you don't bother explaining it because they just wouldn't get it? It's like that. And it's going to be like talking to a dog in the near future. They don't understand wtf you're saying - they only understand the tone and your pitch.

It's NOT simple and it's not what the hell. I'm sorry and it clearly sucks. Nobody asked for us to be in this situation but here we are. 

She's losing parts of herself at a time - and we don't even know which parts is going and already gone. She's not even trying to lose them, they're leaving HER. I understand your need to vent but I feel for your mom because she's trapped in a body that won't allow her to comprehend anything or verbally express accurately how she's feeling. It's like having your tongue permanently tied or your mind keeps forgetting things that you *should* know and it's right there but you can't seem to reach it or grasp for it and it's slipping away.
Instead of focusing on what she can't do, or what she does ""wrong"", focus on what she can still do.

Because is some months or years, she won't be able to do those things anymore.

Appreciate her for what she is now

Easier said than done most of the time, of course, but it'll be a good habit to get into.
My grandmas daughters got POA. And I moved into her house to care for her. Even sleeping in the bedroom next door she’ll still try and sign up for things via targeted adverts on Facebook or things that come through the post. Luckily when they ring I can hold them off. If I’m out and she agrees to whatever sales pitch they get blocked by POA. If they ring back a third time, we report them for trying to screw an OAP.",2022-04-28 10:31:26,lady_tron,udwcyu
Alzheimers,Caregiver Grandson - Am I Taking Adantage?,"Hi.

A long post for a first post.

About 5 years ago I became, accidentally, a caregiver for my grandfather.  

I lived mostly with my grandparents as I was growing up.  They legally adopted me.  They were basically my parents though my mother is alive and I am close with her as well.  My grandmother died over 20 years ago.  

Anyway, 6 years ago, I was living abroad and came home for Christmas to visit my family.  We were in the beginning stages of realizing my grandfather had Alzheimer's at that time.  While I was visiting, my grandfather fell on a patch of ice and shattered the bones in his lower leg.  He was living with his ""girlfriend"" at that time and they were a good pair, she was strong of mind and he was strong of body, and they made it work.  With his broken leg, they could no longer make it work.  My visit turned into me living with them and nursing my grandfather back to health.  After 5 or 6 long months, his leg was healed and I was ready to be on my way.  Just as I was making arrangements to leave my grandfather's girlfriend broke her hip and moved into an assisted living.   My grandfather, we were just figuring out, was not able to take care of himself any longer. 

I stayed with him.

After a few months of that, we, the family, decided he would go stay in the assisted living where his girlfriend was.  He wasn't in favor of that, but we eventually got him to agree.  While those arrangements were being made, I was talking with him about it everyday trying to make sure he understood what was going to happen.  It became clear that that was not at all what he wanted.  I said that I would stay with him in his house.

As the disease goes, it's been getting harder and harder to take care of him.  It's only my mom and I that help him.  I haven't had a full day and night away from him in almost two years.  

Just before the pandemic started I was going to move him into the assisted living with his girlfriend.  With COVID, that got put on hold.  Complicating the issue is that she lives in another state.  

I'm again, trying to get him out to where she is.  Though they haven't lived together since 2017, they have talked on the phone nearly every night since.  She's been the one constant person in his life (other than me) throughout all of this.  His other grandchildren have basically nothing to do with him.  He has two grandchildren that live in the same city he does, they haven't acknowledged him since Christmas.  He has two other grandchildren that live in other states, they sent him a Christmas card and nothing more.  As mentioned, my mom sees him a few times a week so I can try to recharge, and he has a son who lives in another state who calls him sporadically. 

I quit my job 5 years ago when he broke his leg.  I had a part time job for a while when he was able to be left alone for a few hours and mostly just needed help with meals.  I quit that job when he was no longer able to be left alone.  It was agreed that he would give me some money every month to replace some of the income I lost.  

My plan for moving him in with his girlfriend involves me moving to the state where she is since he has no other family there (other than a sister who may also have some form of dementia). I'm planning on asking for him to take care of my moving expenses and living expenses for a maximum of 2-3 months after the move while I get myself situated.  Along with his expenses moving into the assisted living, it's going to be a bit of an outlay of cash for him.   He does have a house, some money in a retirement account and a long-term care policy that I, conservatively, estimate at over $500,000 all together.  He's not poor.  But, I know the expenses can add up quickly.  

I think this situation is reasonable.  It's the only way he can be where his girlfriend is as no one else is willing to move so he'll be able to live with his girlfriend (again, other than myself and my mother, she's the only person he has regular contact with).  I've given up 5 years and 2 jobs already to provide care for him.  I'm asking for a couple months of rent money while he's also paying to stay in assisted living, along with enough for some simple furnishings for an apartment and a little cash to get by while I look for a job in a state that I'd never move to if not for this situation.  

My aforementioned uncle will, I'm sure, see it differently.  I have no doubt that my uncle cares for and wants the best for my grandfather.  But he and I do not see eye to eye on anything.  And the whole situation has become quite acrimonious between us.  He has little to say about the situation with his father, except about finances.  I have no doubt when I propose this that it will cause problems.  So, I just want to make sure that I'm not out of line in what I'm asking.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: I quit my job 5 years ago to care for my grandfather.  He gives me some money for his care.  I want to ask the family to approve him paying for me to relocate with him to another state where he can live in an assisted living where his girlfriend lives.  Is this reasonable or am I taking advantage of him financially?



Edit

Just to clarify.  I don't think the current situation is taking advantage of my grandfather

It's the situation about moving out of state and him, potentially, paying my living expenses even though I won't be directly taking care of him since he will be in an assisted living.  But, my moving out of state is still an expense for me that I would be taking on for his benefit.  Thus, I feel it's fair that he pay it.","Very reasonable. After all, you're the only one taking care of him and in my country it is quite a custom for the caregiver(s) to use it. Other relatives usually just want the money without having to deal with the burden of coping with their elders, and someone with Alzheimer's is seen as a double burden.

My congratulations for taking good care of him. I know how hard it is, my granddad has had Alzheimer's for the last 8 years of his life and we kept him at home. It's been like a rollercoaster ride,  but I am glad of such an experience.
Imagine what the cost would be for paid caretakers to do what you're doing. I'd guess you'd need 2 full time carers to do what your doing. Not to mention that you've put your whole life in hold and sacrificed 5 years of working, pension contributions, etc. You are fully entitled to financial support for this. Don't let greedy relatives tell you any differently. Better yet, maybe your uncle could come live and stay for a week with your grandfather to get an idea if what you're doing. Alternately, hire some workers instead to cook, clean, maintain the home, mind medicines and generally look after your grandfather. That might change your uncle's tune reaaaalllll quick.
You are not taking advantage.  You are a wonderful grandson.  No one who hasn’t done it knows what it’s like to give up your life to take care of the elderly.  If they had to pay you for your service it would be $4000 a month minimum.  Keep that in mind when explaining this.  Good luck.
Tell the uncle that he can do his own research on finding caregivers to accomplish all the same tasks that you do (list them) at the competitive market rate, and then add up the totals himself.
Think of it as a job relocation package.  It’s not taking advantage as hiring someone to handle the transition for your grandfather, and then continue to be there for him, would be cost prohibitive (if you could even find such a person).  Additionally, the care involved does not just go away when they are moved into assisted living.  They’ll still need an advocate with the facility, doctors, and hospitals.  This is another job that people pay someone to do.  

Be ready to make the case why the move is best for your grandfather.   To be with his gf, better medical access? Cost of the facility?  Handling the move and transition is worth the outlay for rent you need to get established, especially after the unpaid role you’ve been filling for years.  Also present the alternative of what happens if you don’t do this.  Good luck.
Have your mother stand up to your uncle.  You and your mom should also hire an elder law attorney and see if you can get some legal paperwork to shore up your claim.

That long-term care insurance MIGHT have paid you as a home caregiver all this time - have you checked?  They might only pay for facility care but they might also pay for a home caregiver.

You've been very good to your grandfather and I see you are planning to continue that.  I respect that more than I could say.  Your uncle can go pound rocks.",2022-04-28 04:01:25,CBeisbol,udpxg9
Alzheimers,2.7 Miles Down on the NCT with this Mad Man,,"My dad is in year 5 and we just got done hiking 2.7 miles on the North Country Trail.  He is weird about taking pictures with me so he did this weird fake ridiculous laugh and after I looked at the photo I laughed harder than I have in a long time.  It was a good day.

Alzheimers,A genuinely good day.,"They got up at 10AM. Had breakfast, lunch and dinner at vaguely “normal” times. While they were having a nap in the afternoon I felt comfortable to go on a half hour walk. All food was eaten with no picking at bits. Told her about what the family are doing with no repeats. At bedtime she was tired and wanted to get to sleep. Some days are not just averagely nice, they’re actually really happy times.",I'm glad you were able to have a good day.

Alzheimers,At the end of a 5.5 year early onset Alzheimer’s journey; end of life hospice care at home.,"Sitting here with my best friend as her husband and best friend of 36 years walks him home, finally. Our Robbie was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s in 2017- he was only 59. The doctors explained how aggressive this type of diagnosis is and how rapidly her life would change… it was not an understatement. The cruelty of this disease is that you lose your person twice. Once while they are physically in front of you, and then again when they are called home. He is 65 years old and tonight we are heading into night 2 of sitting by his side as he slowly leaves our lives in the physical form. This disease is so cruel and my heart goes out to all of you who are also living in this heavy reality. Love & light to you all - you are not alone. Big hugs to everyone 💜","My mom also has early onset alzheimers. She was diagnosed at 62 and is turning 66 next month. In these 3,5 years there is been a rapid decline. A year after the diagnose I moved back to my parents to help out, I lived with them for 2 years. A half year ago she was moved to care home. I just hope the end-stage will be fast, as I look into it with a heavy heart. Thanks for sharing your story, it’s somewhat comforting to know I’m not alone with these feelings.
Starting year 17 of late onset Alz from 71-87 so far. 5.5 years of apx late stage 7 and currently at 18 months of complete immobility motionless in a hospital bed. She was put on hospice 2 years ago and is still here and no one knows when her time is up, but every day that goes by is just another miserable existence of just babbling about a couple dozen nonsensical words over and over again with her eyes closed. Knows nothing of her surroundings for a long while now. I'm not sure how so many people know within a short amount of time when a loved one is going to pass, as with my mom she's already 4 months past her doctor's most extreme end of life scenario.
I'm so sorry you all are going thru this. As a Caretaker of two moms both with Alzheimer's I know what you have gone thru.
Please feel free to look at my friends blog about her journey and she would be happy to be part of the community if you need others in your support system who have gone through this. I know she couldn’t of done it without the people she met who had been where she is too. Her blog is called www.formyrob.com
My mom has her eyes closed all the time but is actually sleeping for few hours during the day and over night. The nurse comes twice a week and checks her vitals, which is always fine it seems and to treat her paper skin wounds mostly on her arms. It's hard to see her in this state to say the least.",2022-04-26 23:07:16,daniafricalifornia,uctur8
Alzheimers,Are these the early stages?,"So my grandmother has dementia in the worst stage now, it’s been getting worse over 4 years but now there is hardly anything left of her. It’s been a lot for my mother ( her daughter) but I’m afraid now that I see some symptoms with her now too. I’ve never been close to my grandmother, showing for example in how up until my mid to late teens she would still give me presents with clothes in the size  that I wore in 3rd grade. 
I always put it with The fact that I hardly ever saw her but maybe those were the early stages for her.

Right now I’m visiting my mother and today just been a lot. She’s been asking me the same 4 questions about 5ish times in the span of an hour and again a few hours later. And she’s been telling me the same story of what happened to her about the same amount of times. 
When I phoned her earlier today her voice sounded different, higher more head voice like. She basically sounded like her mother. Now when I arrived her voice sounded the same and only after a few hours shifted back to her regular tone. 
I’m very sensitive when it comes to people constantly repeating themselves and me also having to tell the same thing over and over and over again so this stuck with me today. Over the past 2 years I’ve noticed this behaviour with her a lot more often. Of course she is afraid that she ends up just like her mother. We are a forgetful family as in constantly misplacing things we need, especially while we’re ovulating but it’s getting out of the ordinary now.

Can this be early indicators?","They could be, but I would caution you against overinterpreting them.  Since I have been caring for my husband with Alzheimer's, I've felt like my own cognition is getting sketchy; but my support group says that it's a result of being overloaded with all the mental demands that used to be shared with my spouse, and will get better when I'm no longer responsible for so much.

If your mom is willing to talk about it, I'd recommend she get an assessment at a geriatrics clinic which will serve as a baseline if she needs to be reassessed in a few years.
How old is your mother? If she’s in her 50s it could also be due to to menopause…brain fog and forgetfulness are common. Stress can also make people very forgetful. But dementia can run in families so it may be worth encouraging your mom to get checked out.
How old is she? My mother started showing signs at 55 and her father had it too. It sounds to me like it could be early signs of early-onset. Is she unable to juggle tasks that she used to do seamlessly? Being more sedentary? Alzheimer’s isn’t just about forgetting things. You won’t know for sure until you get her evaluated.",2022-04-26 18:02:30,DrivenByPettiness,ucnyws
Alzheimers,Advice for Neely diagnosed Early Onset?,"I am a 48y (F) married to my 51yo (M) spouse for 27y.  We have a 22yo (F) child who lives with her fiancé (23y M).  Right now I am classified mildly cognitive impaired but I also suffered a TBI last Autumn after being hit in the head accidentally by a piece of luggage in a plane while traveling alone.  That is how we found out about the EOA which is why I brought it up.  
A couple of months (6) before the TBI, my husband retired. We sold our house, bought a big RV and decided to become nomads because the last 25 years of our lives had been difficult, struggling with serious illnesses (mine and our child’s mostly) that seriously impacted our ability to travel even 2 hours from our home.  Traveling had been something we always wanted to do and saw this as our chance to finally do it, so we did.  
Now, I’m worried what my new impairments will mean to the life we have chosen.  I know that it could be a while before we see significant impairment but there are already things that are difficult like my not being able to lay down short term memory correctly.  He has to remind me on a daily basis about things that I would never have forgotten before.  Everything from prior to the last year is pretty solid, up until the head injury.  From there it is almost like a blank page on a lot of things.  I manage our finances, I always have, we hadn’t had a late payment in over 15 years… we’ve had 3 in the last 6 months.  I can’t just hand the finances off to him because he’s horrible at it, that’s why I took it over.  I got us straightened out financially and the thought of it going to hell causes a lot of stress.  A lot.  I’ve got a calendar on my phone now to remind me of due dates and I’ve put auto pay on everything I can to avoid late payments, are there other tools I should be using?  
I’m taking my med cocktail to slow progression and while it has given me a bit more alertness it hasn’t changed anything significantly.  I have other health issues (I’ve lost half my abdominal organs in a massive surgery [total pancreatectomy] to save me from a serious illness about 14 years ago) and our daughter has significant mental health issues.  He has diabetes type 2, I am type 3 from my abdominal surgery so those are all things that we have to deal with on a daily basis.  We’ve lost a lot of family in the last couple of years, most CoVid related, and that has impacted how we have viewed our end of life plans.  What we didn’t plan for was for either of us losing who we are and I don’t know how to handle that.  He is my rock, he’s amazingly kind and patient but I know what dementia can look like and I don’t want him to have to deal with that on his own.  That’s where the guilt comes in HARD.  
Suggestions?  I know it’s a lot of info to throw at you but I figured the more you know the better you understand what we’re dealing with.  TIA","So sorry to hear your trials & tribulations, waa gosh that's a lot you've all endured, champions!  Amazing going mobile nomads, fabulous experiences!   

Alzheimers .org or Dementia .org were a lifesaver for us.   Expert experienced in all aspects of memory-loss diseases & conditions.  Tons of resources, info, booklets, tips tactics for memory-loss management, counselling, telephone helplines, mini-workshops & courses for family / friends / carers & the memory-lossed themselves - they are great help to us.  Either find an office where you can go visit, or check on-line website.  

 Yeh, putting notes on yr phone calendar is good - and perhaps an actual weekly diary such as business people use also is helpful?  Or even just an A4 sized notebook.  When it's all written down on plain paper it's easier to see right there.   You can both make notes, lists, reminders , that you can both see and check.   For my mum, being in her 80's, telephone / technology use was never an option, weekly diary was/is of huge help.  A4-size, with each week visible on a double page.  

Alzhms/dementia org I think will be able to assist you finding / accessing all sorts of information that will be useful to you both.   Don't sweat the small stuff, adapt, have happy times.    best of luck!
Give him POA (power of attorney) like now - yesterday was a better time. 
You need to sit down with him and talk him through how to prepare finances right now. Do not delay. How are you going to get care when things get hard? How is he going to handle it? 

Is he going to be your full-time caregiver? What are your retirement funds? Do you have long-term care insurance in place? It's too late to get it now since you're diagnosed. 

Both of you should reach out to alzheimers.org in your area and begin seeing support groups as well as attend trainings/webinars/info sessions on what to expect and what happens in a typical regression period for alz. It's not always linear and things may go that you don't expect to go. He will be the caregiver and this will be a major stressor for him - depression can and does happen for caregivers so he needs major support to reduce depression and burnout. My father found solace and support in the caregiving support groups as well as a strong community with friends and family nearby. 

Is he willing to be your full-time caregiver? Is he willing to feed you when you can't feed yourself? How about staying home to make sure you don't wander or leave the stove on? You're going to forget how to flush the toilet and bathe yourself as well. Is he going to help you when you go through incontinence? He may not be able to so this is why people need to think about that now.  Make those preparations now. This isn't easy or fun and you may regress a lot faster than you think. My mother has younger-onset alzheimer's and she's had it for 15 years while I know someone else who died in 4 years in their 40s/50s. 

My father is her full-time caregiver, including doing the dirty work like wiping her ass. Are you two prepared for this? I'm sorry to sound harsh but most people do not understand the detrimental effects this has on families. I know you already feel guilty so to alleviate that guilt - PREPARE NOW. 

I'm so sorry for your diagnosis and to hear of your family's troubles. This is why I'm an advocate for alzheimer's disease so that nobody - including families like yours have to go through what mine does/did.
If I may ask, what led to your diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer's?  Have you had a spinal tap?

The reason I ask is early onset Alzheimer's is misdiagnosed a lot and it would be important to make sure you are not misdiagnosed.  Outside of a spinal tap or an amyloid PET scan, it would be very hard to actually diagnose early onset AD in a 48 year old that is still within the MCI range.

Especially with your TBI which by itself could cause memory troubles.

What commonly happens is a significant memory impairment is observed which leads to this diagnosis.  Perhaps a brain MRI is done but this is not very useful for diagnosing AD.

But there are endless causes of significant memory impairment and early onset Alzheimer's is one of the rarest ones.

If you have not had a spinal tap or amyloid pet scan to lead to a diagnosis then I would highly recommend a second opinion with a memory specialist neurologist.

  If you have had those things and it is confirmed then I would look into clinical trials because there are several medications on the horizon that may be fairly beneficial that currently have trials on going",2022-04-26 00:03:29,Yep_ThatTracks,uc3xfg
Alzheimers,iPhone games to play with long-distance early(ish) stage mother?,"I know a small amount of games can help reduce anxiety in anxious people. Also I would like to help support some light cognitive processing for my mother and bond whilst we are long distance. 

My first thought “words with friends”, it’s like a scrabble game and i remember having lots of fun with it. 

If anyone is familiar with that, is it a good choice? Do you have other app recommendations? My mother was diagnosed a year ago. 

Also I just realized so many apps have ads all over them which are annoying but I accept them when I’m playing, however I know they may be overwhelming for mum. So maybe I have to look for a game that’s paid so there isn’t ads

Thanks for your thoughts anyone!!","My mother was diagnosed 3 years ago and loves words with friends.
Wordle one play a day, no ads https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

There are lots of Wordle variations out there.
My grandma likes Words With Friends and Ticket to Ride. Most German style games where everyone plays to the end is an important thing. Try also Carcassonne. But the easiest thing is to do a Skype / FaceTime / Zoom family Quiz. You can include questions that will bring back memories of their youth.
iMessage games are really good, especially GamePigeon
Lots of scammmers and creeps on these games…be very careful, as they can message her while she plays.  I quit words with friends cause of pedophile types writing nasty things to me, and I’m in my 40’s.",2022-04-26 04:27:59,glass_leopard444,uc7rc5
Alzheimers,Bathroom sink,"Hey all,

Anyone have any suggestions as to how to stop my father from using the bathroom sink?

He's either peeing in the sink, or shaking his pee off in the sink. This wouldnt be too big of a deal, but it emits quite an odor after awhile. The odor usually comes from the main drain or overflow drain. 

I'm usually working in the basement, but I'll come up to check on him every couple of hours and be greeted by the horrible odor from the bathroom sink.
It got so strong that I taped off the sink bowl to signal its 'off limits'. I also placed a make shift sign over the red tape stating ""do not use"". It works for awhile until he eventually rips the tape/sign off completely.

Any thoughts? Just deal with it?","You may want to think about changing the color of the toilet seat and rim - maybe red or a very contrasting color so he can better see the toilet. You may want to line the rim with red tape or something. 

Red makes it easier to see so mark the toilet with that instead of the sink.

Edit: Also make sure you flush for him. They will forget to flush more often.
So I’m the southwest we use waterless urinals.  They have a liquid that sits in the U Bend that is lighter that urine.  The urine falls through the liquid and the liquid traps the sewer gas so it doesn’t come up.   I’m sure you can find it online.  The down side is running water to wash your hands could wash away the liquid
Your idea of taping off the sink seems like the best option to me. I can't think of any other way. Caregiving for ALZ requires constant creativity. Hopefully others can suggest something.",2022-04-25 21:23:15,EveryCost3239,uc0wgj
Alzheimers,Jelly Drops,"[www.jellydrops.us](https://www.jellydrops.us/)

""Jelly Drops are award-winning candy designed to boost hydration. They’re 95% water, sugar-free and vegan with added electrolytes.

Inventor Lewis Hornby was inspired to create water candy after his grandma Pat, who had dementia, was struggling to hydrate.

With a fantastic solid, but smooth, texture - these candies do not have a liquid centre - encouraging independent hydration for all, through a delicious snack.""

I started following them years ago, and they're finally available for sale. Sadly, all three of my remaining grandparents have passed since then, but I wanted to share. I know how hard it is for those older ones to stay hydrated, and how much my grandmas in particular loved candy :)","I can't believe they are finally available to buy. I remember reading about them years ago.
They've been available in UK for a while now.

Main problem is that they are just too expensive and give a relatively small boost to hydration (each jelly drop is 12.5ml).

The cheapest subscription rate would cost almost £50 a month and allow for 6 jelly drops a day, or 75ml of water.

It's disappointing that what was a good idea doesn't seem to have resulted in helping many people.
They look really cool!   I would buy some but yeh Australia, so far away lol, border control customs have problems with food items.   Great idea, good on you!",2022-04-25 20:30:26,happy_bluebird,ubzuzh
Alzheimers,Advice on living in the present,"Good day!

I have a mother-in-law that is currently living with my family. It was not out of financial necessity but preference as we enjoy staying close as my family travels a lot for work.

A recent doctor visit indicated some early onset conditions of Alzheimer’s.

Understanding that how long she lives with us under what condition is a complex question that needs to be answered, I would like to set that aside, and instead ask:

How can we create a comfortable living environment where her deteriorating memory and awareness are as least impactful as can be? I like to think a platonic 50 first dates.

- She will always have a portion of space that is just hers.

- We have some important personal objects that she associates strongly with that decorate her room.

- We are all planning on at least a few therapy sessions to establish positive behaviors. Especially for my young daughter that may not fully understand.

Thoughts?","Speaking from where I am right now, you have to be realistic about some of the behavioral declines.  My spouse used to go on a walkabout any time he was mad about something.  (The police would find him and bring him home.)  Now, the most annoying thing he does is he has no idea of personal boundaries.  He's always digging into closets or boxes and finding things which he wanders about depositing throughout the house.  He has stolen my electric toothbrush and my eyeglasses and it took a few days to get both of those back.  He must try on 5 or 6 complete outfits a day and discard them in a big pile.  You're talking about her having her own space but you will find that doesn't register at some point.

Also there's the possibility that she may become aggressive at some point.  Even if she doesn't, you may have to lock up your drugs and your knives and scissors for safety, put an alarm on her bed and on your exit doors, and struggle to keep her out of the kitchen when she no longer understands food safety.  She may leave faucets running and burners turned on, or the microwave running when empty.

Anyway, most of this won't matter at the beginning, so you can change direction in a year or two or whenever it seems merited.  But I am coming to the opinion that dementia does not always fit well in a standard home.
Bless you for wanting to make this situation the least impactful.  She will forget who each person is.  I suggest the family focus on accepting being forgotten.  This is like her death because she will go away but not physically.  Realize she will become someone different than each of you know.  Her reality will change on a moments notice and my best advice is to go with it.  As long as there is safety in what is happening, if she thinks her daughter is a visiting neighbor then go with it.  I would play some of her favorite music at times and maybe even sing along.  Usually this is soothing.  If she needs to be busy, give her laundry to fold.  Anything you don't want to disappear put it out of her reach.  I have yet to find my tv remote.  If you  have pets, normally they find them comforting.  My mother never tolerated a dog in the bed until she had alzheimer's then she would walk the house until she found her boo to go to bed with.  Can't have real pet, get one of those robotic animals.  I also gave my mom a dollbaby to dress and play with.  This is a very challening undertaking.  I stayed in prayer daily for peace and my mom never became agitated while in my home.  She may have forgotten who we were but she knew the people around her loved her.  Memories may fade but emotions continue to be felt.  Expect paranoia.  Wouldn't you be scared if you forgot who you were and where you were all the time?  Good luck.   Blessings to ya

Alzheimers,How much longer?,"My mom has extremely advanced, terminal Alzheimer’s. She was committed to hospice care on Friday after collapsing (she’s been living in a facility the past year). At the time the nurses apparently told my dad — I wasn’t there — she doesn’t have much longer and might die over the weekend. She hasn’t eaten solid foods (or really anything) in a week or more and weighs only about 80 pounds. She’s on methadone and a few other sedatives; yesterday when I visited her she didn’t wake up. She just sort of lays there like a cadaver, breathing in a raspy way. 

My question for others on here is: how long did your loved one last at the very end? I can’t believe she’s still clinging to life because she seems so weak and broken, but could she stay like this for another week? Two? I know death comes on its own time and isn’t beholden to anyone, so I’m just looking to hear other people’s stories about the End. Thanks.","I knew a woman in a similar situation. No food for a week, only comfort meds, very labored breathing. It was about five days to the end.

But it's impossible to know. Could be two minutes, could be a week. But if the hospice nurses are telling you the end is near, expect it to happen at almost any moment now. ♥️
My aunt died of multiple organ failure and spent just over a week in hospice. I was with her every day (she was like a mother to me) & it was hard. 

She was losing responsiveness about 3-4 days in & seemed to be struggling, fighting, maybe in pain & it was really heartbreaking. We played music for her (she was a singer) and we could see her heart rate shoot up at certain songs, so we felt like maybe there was some consciousness & processing even if she couldn't communicate.

The nurses thought it would go quickly & she would have these moments where it seemed like she was fading but then would come back and stabilize.

The last night I was sitting with her, I just sat there and told her how much we loved her, how we had done everything we can and there's nothing else we can do. If there was anything we could do to bring her back, we'd do it, but there isn't, so it is okay to let go. I don't know if she could hear me at all, but she passed two hours later when we stepped out to get dinner.

This is only anecdotal & I will never know for sure if the goodbye that I said to her helped her through or if the timing was random chance. Still, if it helped end that suffering she was in at the end, I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
My mother was released into in-home hospice on a Tuesday. By Saturday morning, the hospice nurse gave her 48 hours to live. She was gone by Monday afternoon.

Her last two days, she just laid there, sweating profusely and her entire torso heaving with every breath. When I gave her some water through a straw, she drank eagerly, stopping only to catch her breath. I knew that giving her water to drink, so close to the end, might have been ill-advised*, but seeing her so thirsty broke my heart. 

I was surprised she lasted so long, once taking pills became impossible, since she had Type 2 diabetes.

*As the body starts shutting down, the kidneys become unable to process liquids; continuing to consume water at this point can cause painful complications. Plus, all it really accomplishes is to prolong a life that is no longer worth living.
So sorry, it's very sad, and hard for you all.  I have no idea we're not there yet,  just wanted to say I feel for you!   Bless your mamma for peaceful transition.   \* hugs \*
The ""death rattle"" is the end. It sounds like a combination of snoring and gargling mouthwash. My grandmother started making that sound faintly, and only when lying flat down, on Sunday evening. The CNA visited at noon on Monday. She said that it's the final 72 hours. She was a doctor in her home country. She called hospice and told them to move the regularly scheduled nurse visit from Wednesday to Tuesday. On Monday night (2:30 am) I gave her a dose of morphine, sat her more upright, put on calming music, and I told her she had permission to go, and everyone will be OK. By Tuesday 8 am, my brother popped in to check on her, and found her gone.
When their heads tip back at an awkward looking angle, it’s often days. Usually not eating or drinking is a sign it’ll be less than a week.
It's been 18 months for my 87 year old mom so far since she has became immobile. It's awful. Nobody imagined she would still be around by 2022, yet here we are. My wife says it's because I take care of her extremely well, but not sure how to access that considering her existence has been absolutely miserable for years now.",2022-04-25 08:03:59,that_cad,ubjjvl
Alzheimers,My Alzheimer’s Mom refuses to get blood test and mammogram ..I don’t know what to do,"my mom hasn’t got the mammogram exam and blood test  since she was diagnoised with Alzheimer’s disease in 2017. My mom lost her medical insurance in 2018 because she had to quit her job due to her disease,

so my parents didn’t go to the doctors forawhile.. they had medical A and B since they qualified because of their age  , but due to financial reasons. They didn’t want to deal with copayments and I normally bought their medications through Walmart with the RX discount ..

&#x200B;

currently we’re financially better because my sister is helping me and I got a remote job, also doing side delivery gigs …my parents also got a senior advantage plan with their original hospital , so they are seeing their regular doctor normally…

&#x200B;

my Moms primary physicIan wanted her to get a breast exam and blood work , since she hasn’t done it for a few years, so I set the appointment for Friday .I take her to the appointment and I notify the nurse/staff she has Alzheimer’s disease…..I was in the waiting room but the nurse assistant came out in five minutes with my mom and told me it’s impossible to do this exam..while my mom was coming out in tears. I don’t know what happen but I know my mom doesn’t listen to anybody and she will get aggressive because of Alzheimer’s. The staff didn’t tell me what exactly happen but I guess they were frustrated.

&#x200B;

then I told my mom lets just do the blood test …once we have her seated. She keeps crying about wanting to go home and gets up ..Im already frustrated. I even have to raise my voice a bit in front of public ppl .. I just told myself. I just want to go home and I’m gonna reschedule the appointments again…","This is very typical and normal for someone with Alzheimer's. Medical staff also rarely know how to work with someone with Alzheimer's without proper training. 

My mom also refused to go to the doctor because she has no idea what's going on, why she needs to go, and she's scared/terrified.
Your mom is losing sense of the world and everything around her and what's going on. 

I hate to sound mean but I have to break this gently and somehow but YOU need to find some more compassion and be patient. YOu cannot raise your voice in public to her because that will make things worse - yes, we did that too. Your post sounds like you're tired of her and frustrated but put yourself in her shoes. You're losing not just your memory but who you are and you look at something and you wonder what it is - and the word is there, you know it but you can't reach for it. You look around and you're in a room of people and you have no idea why you're in this room and who you can trust, who's a stranger, who's a friend, and nothing makes sense anymore. You'd be utterly terrified. She is terrified and showing it in anger and mistrust. That's a defense and coping mechanism. 

The only way I got my mother to go to the doctor was to lie to her and tell her that I was going and that I needed company. When we got there, I went in with her and went inside the exam room with her, and they pretended to do all their exam stuff on me and said oh why don't we do one on you as well? It's free take your blood pressure day! It's free breast exam day! And we went along with it and I was there. 

When you're with your mom, you need to be the protector/defender. She's scared and as long as you make her feel secure/safe, she will more likely want to go along with what you say and suggest. 

Use a kind voice, be positive and upbeat. It's hard - I understand but really, find some compassion.

Edit: Also don't try to rationalize with her. Go along with her feelings, reassure her that she's safe and you're watching out for her. That helps a lot. If she says there invisible children in the bedroom, don’t argue. I pretend I’m speaking to these invisible kids and tell them to hush and shoo, leave my mom alone! And tell her that I took care of it. 

Edit again to say - we didn’t bother with any head scans because it’s impossible. Forget the mammograms because if she doesn’t want to, she doesn’t want to. We took her to the doctor to get her diagnosed and check ups for her Alzheimer’s.
This is going to sound harsh and I am sorry about this, nothing about this terrible disease isn't harsh for the people going through it and the people suffering from it. Why does she need a mammogram? Most likely she doesn't have breast cancer, and the test is really upsetting her. Alzheimer's is a terminal disease, so unless she is at high risk for aggressive breast cancer it may be a moot point. 

I'm sorry you have to deal with this. It is a rough road to travel and I wish you peace.
How old is your Mom?  

My Mom is in her 80's but I feel like, at what point, do we keep going to the cardiologist, endocrinologist, etc.  Her body might be in good condition but her mind is deteriorating. What's the point of it all?
I stopped preventative care for my grandmother when she could no longer tolerate medical appointments. Alzheimers is already a terminal disease. There's no sense stressing her out.
Other commenter is sadly right.. you gotta meet them more than halfway, wherever they are. 

Its good you warned them she has Alzheimer's, but you might want to tell them what that means.. maybe you should go in there with her when they set her up for the scans, and leave the room when they take the shot, and reenter for each repositioning, to keep her calm and to slow down the technician if they are going too fast. 

If shes already upset from a bad experience during mammogram you can expect she will have a hard time with blood draw, or anything after that really. Maybe next time do blood draw first, if you think that will be simpler for her, or schedule them on separate days, or before and after lunch, so she has some down time in between and hopefully more cheerful distraction. But yeah be prepared to have to try again another day. 

Maybe you can find out from your neighborhood Aarp, Alzheimer's association, and/or state or county office on aging if you can find some kind of cheap or free support. Aarp and Alzheimer's association have free education. Alzheimer's assoc has free support groups. Both may have pamphlets or guidance specific for your area. 

You probably have a state office on aging and elderly affairs, and if you have a county level one it might be even better. Some govt offices have dementia divisions too. They may have something like resource guides or grants or programs that can help you. 

For example maybe they could have provided a nurse or dementia-sensitive care professional to go with you and her to an appointment. Or maybe they have a list of volunteer organizations that can provide an escort for her, especially if you're feeling frazzled. 

Its definitely an uphill climb up an avalanche-prone slope.. i wish i could tell you itll get easier. I hope you can find it in yourself to get help, be calmer, forgive her, and forgive yourself. Good luck.
You or your sister needs to go in the exam room with your mom to keep her calm and make sure she feels safe.  My wife always goes into the room with my MIL for everything.
Do nothing. Your mom has little control over her life now, let her control what she can. A Mammo and blood work won't make the Alzheimer's go away. It's an awful disease.
Take her out for icecream and have her come along. After Icecream say you need to stop at the drs office for a visit. Coordinate with the office ahead of time to have the nurses do their magic.",2022-04-25 01:38:53,Fartiebartie,ubdtt3
Alzheimers,MIL not eating.,"Hi guys. My partners mum was diagnosed a few weeks ago with early onset. He has been to see her and said ‘there’s nothing to her’ and that she is barely eating. There was food in the fridge that had gone past their sell by/best before dates because she’s not touching and, she does however have food such as pasta, in her cupboards, she just won’t eat it. My partner bought them a takeaway and made toast as well as a roast dinner and she demolished it, so it seems that she will eat when it is put in front of her but she won’t make it/cook it herself. 

I have suggested pre-packaged sandwiches from a supermarket, so she doesn’t have to make them and they are there and ready to eat and a meal delivery service has also been suggested  as a possible option. Is there anything else we can do? Thanks!","Get her into a facility now. She has no business being alone if she can’t remember to eat. She needs to go right to a memory care facility.
She needs a caretaker or help to get to a facility. Without support, she will go hungry. 

It doesn’t matter what she still remembers to do and doesn’t if she can’t remember to eat and make something without help. The disease doesn’t make any sense, there’s not always a regular level of regression even if she can still make tea or whatever. 

Certain parts of the brain goes and it doesn’t always makes sense.
I've got a similar issue, which is being dealt with for now by me ordering a regular supply of frozen ready made meals delivered to my LO, and a support worker visiting her every day to check she's had lunch plus a supplement drink. Whether this works for you depends on your access to services like these, which may not be available in your area. Without them, we would have to find alternative living arrangements.
She shouldn't be encouraged to cook.  It can be dangerous, when a burner is left on or something similar.  Maybe she intuitively knows not to trust herself to do this.

A meal delivery service is a good idea, but it should be cooked food, like they deliver in Meals on Wheels.  Not a box of groceries that have to be assembled and prepared.",2022-04-24 18:21:50,lifewithlaurenx,ub5y0t
Alzheimers,Ward of the state?,"My dad (58 with early on set) is finally in a nursing home because he needed to be given a feeding tube in his stomach and Medicare has been paying for it for 1 days. We are about halfway there and although my mom has had an elder care lawyer for about a year, the process for Medicare and now Medicaid has been horrible. Medicaid denied us so the process is going through again. So far she has spent thousands of dollars and has nothing left for herself besides her home. 

Does anyone have experience making a parent/spouse a ward of the state? Would  my mom be financially responsible after that? Could we still visit him even if we give up rights?","The elder care lawyer didn’t recommend divorce? I spoke with the estate planning lawyer and we explored divorce as a strategy for asset protection. Given the types of our assets there really wasn’t an advantage for us to get divorced. But the lawyer told me it happens all the time. You find a sympathetic judge, give all the non protected assets (home equity and pension accounts are protected) to your mom and then Medicaid is forced to pay for your father’s medical needs.

I am definitely not an expert on this subject but I was told this information from someone that gave me a lot of confidence they were.
Look up ""spousal impoverishment"" and the name of your state on a search engine.

Also look for ""Agency on Aging"" or ""Aging and Disability Resource Center"" and see if they can help you straighten out the finances.  I know, it's very stressful and takes time.
I hope this can point you in the right direction

Alzheimers,Dad forgets that he eats!,"You didn't read that backwards. My dad legitimately forgets that he has eaten. Every day, every meal. 

He's 67 and had a stroke in 2014, absolutely no working memory and his long term memories cut off at around 1979. I moved him into my house after my mom passed in October. Over all, we love having him around and bonding with his grandkids! But there's one issue: he is ALWAYS eating.

For example, I'll cook dinner. He'll have a serving and ask for a second. No worries there, I have two teenagers - there's always plenty of leftovers. But here's where it gets funky - he'll go put his plate up and grab a pb&j sandwich on his way back. Up to 3 times per meal. He also pops out for a sandwich.

His wait shocks me, too. He's maybe 5'6"" (about 1.7m),but weighs about 160lbs (about 80-ish kg, doing the math in my head). We've had tests run, but his docs have no clue what is making so utterly ravenous!

Anyone who has had a similar experience?","My mom was the same. We would give her half her lunch the first time she asked for it and the other half the second time she alleged she hadn’t eaten. You can offer a lot of liquids as they lose the ability to distinguish thirst and hunger. So maybe some tea and a few heathy cookies?
An effect of the stroke, perhaps?

Alzheimer's patients often like sweets; but are not necessarily ravenous.
My dad had the exact same experience. He gained so much weight because he would forget. He would also get up in the middle of the night for snacks multiple times too. My mom ended up having to hide stuff
This happened with my mom. She still doesn't remember, but now her appetite has curbed.
I think that's pretty common with people like me who love to eat because of how nice eating is. It's not that he's hungry, it's that the usual curbs on his appetite, which is different from hunger, are the highly complicated calculations that his brain can't do anymore. My friend with Alzheimer's is the same way, and one of the ""eat to live"" carers tries to reason him out of eating all the ice cream at once. And I'm like ""That wouldn't even work on me, and I don't have Alzheimer's.""

I agree with hiding and disguising food (a brown paper bag will work with my friend); I would also consider finding some things that he could eat a lot of and making those readily available. Rice cakes are hard to eat fast and have good crunchy mouthfeel, and you could try DIY popsicles that are mostly water with a bit of juice for color and flavor, for a couple of examples. Fridge and cabinet locks can work in some households, but it sounds like right now your dad might be just as capable of unlocking them as you are; anything you can do to make it look like a food is all gone will be helpful, like hiding the full jar of PBJ in the over-fridge cabinet and keeping one with just a tablespoon on the regular shelf. (And don't throw that one out when he uses it--just add another tablespoonful from the secret source and put it back on the shelf.) It's going to be more a matter of supervising and redirecting him, and/or making peace with the slipping out for a sandwich. 

It's also possible that it's a kind of brain stimulation that's too satisfying to be easy to stop--a lot of what you're describing is ""This feels nice and I'm going to keep going."" It might be worth exploring a fast transition to something really interesting and absorbing for him when you consider a meal is over (and have the kids bus his plate rather than pointing him back to the kitchen). Unfortunately, a lot of the things that would likely serve your goal here are the opposite of what you'd want to do with a pair of hungry teens in the house, so you may want to enlist them as helpers in making this work for everybody.",2022-04-24 12:17:22,Mrtorbear,uay7zd
Alzheimers,Question for loved ones with incontinence:,"What is the best undergarment you have found? Dad is wearing Depends and still having leaks pretty often. 

Thanks!","Hello. We found the Depends Pull-up briefs leaked at night for MIL. The Tena Stretch Ultra Brief (more like a diaper) was able to hold everything in overnight, including a good amount of urine and even bowel movements. No leaks.
i use kroger brand overnight, with a booster pad in the front to absorb the urine.
We buy Tranquility Premium Overnight Disposable Absorb Underwear (pull-ups) on Amazon for my mother. They say that they can hold up to 34 ounces of liquid. We also use bed pads like other have mentioned here.  


We have also used Abena Abri-Form Premium Incontinence Briefs (diaper style) that are even more absorbent and leak proof. But they are the diaper style so they are not as easy to use as a pull-up. But they are really great at preventing leakage.
depends (or any other brand) a booster if necessary and then a regular normal underwear overtop that holds all firmly in place. helps especially at night with tossing around and so. the regular underwear should be tight but of course not too tight to be uncomfortable. 

for nights arranging his water intake so he gets most of healthy amount of water in the early day and then not so much towards the night helps too.
There are high recommendations on the Alzheimer's Association forums for Dry Direct.
I found no matter the brand there would be leakage and used bed pads as well
We have been using Depends for men, overnight.  The leaks are not too numerous, but that probably owes more to behavioral management (always reminding him to go to the bathroom before bed and put on a new diaper, whether he needs one or not).
Sam's Club has ones that are bigger than Depends and absorb much, much better.  We have occasionally ""doubled up"" when we know that we aren't going to be able to take my mother to the restroom for a little while (such as on an airplane trip).  We also have 36"" x 36"" quilted bed pads to use as a barrier from any leaks to the furniture.
Northshore Care Supply
Poise with Northshore booster pads
The ones my dad uses are called Pre-Vail. I have been impressed with them. There are times when I know my dad has defecated and it barely smells. There were times he was with my brothers, went back to Memory Care, and we know now that he had bowel and urinary incontinence with them and they had no idea. 

I haven’t seen any leaks. And I have checked for them.
Tranquility All Through the Night were the only ones we found that worked for my grandfather.   The brand was recommended to us by a family member that manages an assisted living home.
We had pretty good luck with the Walmart brand pull-ups, called Assurance. We still get leaks when my dad sits funny and the urine will travel. But, we always have him sit and sleep on those washable bed pads.",2022-04-24 07:12:20,Alexstarr718,uasibf
Alzheimers,Process to find out chances of getting familial Alzheimer’s?,"How can my wife find out whether she is likely to get a diagnosis for early onset Alzheimer’s? 

My mother-in-law (64) was officially diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in the last year, but we’ve all known for several years that she had it. My mother-in-law’s older sister was diagnosed about five years ago after several years of symptoms, and her mother was in a home for many years with it dementia-related issues, but not official diagnosed. 

My wife (36) is interested in knowing what her chances are of getting it so we can make better-informed life decisions. What does she need from her mother while her mother is still alive? I’ve heard of genetic counselors. Is that something we should be exploring? We’ve lived overseas for the last eight years and will be returning to the United States this summer and can finally spend some time on this. 

Any advice on how to proceed?","Yes, you should definitely go with a genetic counselor.  You can do some of this yourself but I do not recommend it (and I'm not telling you how).  It's too easy to misinterpret results.  Also the genetic counselor is skilled in talking about the pros and cons of knowing or not knowing.
I went to a geneticist last year and ran the full gamut, she said there is no known marker for Alzheimer’s
Do not get tested until you have long term care insurance In place!! 

They will reject you if you know you may have it. This is serious. Act like you will get it and make all the informed decisions now because if she finds out she may have it, they will absolutely reject her for LTC insurance which she will need if she ever gets it!
Does anyone in her family have a history of blood clots?  Does she? There is a disorder called Hyperhomocysteinemia that causes blood clots of a specific form to develop.  It is easily treated with a b-complex vitamin.  This isn’t like most clotting disorders that require Coumadin/heparin etc to prevent them, it is a specific form of clotting.  The B complex breaks it down and prevents future clots.  Hyperhomocysteinemia is genetic and tends to correlate with Early Onset, I know all this because I used to be a hem/onc nurse in my younger days and because I have both the clotting and EOA.  It is a simple blood test to check for it.  This won’t clear her for other forms/risk factors but it’s a place to start, at least.  It also won’t affect long term care insurance policies, it shouldn’t trip the alarms.  
Hope that helps.",2022-04-23 17:18:36,Booperton1,uaf3ci
Alzheimers,One of those days.,"9AM,  make breakfast “I don’t want it”. Stays in bed
Midday, make lunch “I don’t want it”. Stays in bed
3PM, snack time “I don’t want it”. Stays in bed
6PM, make dinner “it’s too much”. Stays in bed
9PM, snack time “I don’t like that”. Stays in bed
Midnight, gets out of bed, “I’m hungry”.","So don't sweat it.  Also don't knock yourself out if they won't eat it anyway.  Put the food in the fridge and serve it cold at midnight, if asked.

You might try offering some sweets.  I hear a lot of Alzheimer's patients really crave sweets.  It's not great nutrition but better than nothing at all.
And then walks around all night talking to themselves. Noon is the latest I let my wife stay in bed.
People with Alzheimer’s tend to enjoy more sweet things so you can try that. My dad used to put honey on steak and rice or make beef teriyaki. 

Has she forgotten how to feed herself and is saying that as an excuse to not eat? Many cannot vocally express they can’t feed themselves or how to eat anymore. Have you trie to spoon fed them? 

Give it to them and urge them to eat from their hand? Like a piece of fruit. 

Try cutting up the food into smaller bites and feeding her like a small child/toddler.
Muffins on the counter by the coffee maker, or there's ham biscuits on the top shelf in the fridge.  75 seconds for the coffee in the microwave. Enjoy!",2022-04-23 20:01:12,Bolehillbilly,uai6uf
Alzheimers,Have to put my grandma in a home. I am completely lost.,"I apologize if this post is just a ramble, my head isn't on right at all. I'll try to keep it short.

I had been helping my grandpa and dad take care of her for quite some time now, I've been doing all the physical stuff they can't do(both disabled). She's pretty far along now, she rarely knows who I am, cannot be left alone for literally any amount of time, beginning to lose a lot of cognitive function like her words running into eachother or sometimes it just makes zero sense. We were already considering putting her in a home soon- and then my grandpa suddenly passes. He was my rock, practically raised me and taught me so much more about life than any other adult ever has. He was completely fine a week ago and yesterday he passed while basically in a coma. Not only am I totally torn up right now over his death but now I have to take care of her by myself and I just can't. But we can't afford to place her anywhere. A social worker is supposed to come by Monday, but I'm not sure how that's supposed to help. I know nothing about any of this or what we can and can't do. All I know is if I try to take care of her for the rest of her life I am 100% going to lose my mind. I have no idea how anyone can bear to take care of a family member with Alzheimers any farther along than this.

Any advice at all is highly appreciated.","I'm so sorry; this is hard. You're likely to get a geriatric social worker with experience in memory care placements and transitions to Medicaid. You can also call the Alzheimer's Association's 24/7 helpline at 1.800.272.3900 and ask for a care counselor.

It sounds like your grandmother will enter memory care as a Medicaid patient. The state will not expect you to pay for your grandmother. If you have any idea of your grandparents' assets--bank accounts, 401ks, IRAs, whatever--and his will, it would be helpful to collect the paperwork prior to meeting with the social worker. Sometimes Medicaid admits aren't immediate, so it would be worth asking the social worker if there might be additional assistance available to you in caring for her in the mean time. That's state and sometimes municipality-dependent.

And how are you, and do you have a place to live other than your grandparents'? You need to plan for your own future as well. I know it's a lot at the moment, but if you've been managing to help you're made of tough and resourceful stuff.
It sounds like you're in the U.S.  Tell the social worker you need to apply for public funding and get started looking at places.  She'll guide you.  (or he, but in my experience they're usually women)",2022-04-23 13:14:43,precious_mentality,uaa4kh
Alzheimers,How do I know if my grandma has Alzheimer's or normal memory loss? Scared to ask family.,,"There is no cure for Alzheimer's, but you know what else there is no cure for?  Old age.  

In general doctors are fairly cautious about calling a dementia Alzheimer's, because there are a number of other dementias that don't follow the same path and that have different cell pathology.  But to the family, the main difference is not important, the patient is declining, some times faster than other times.

The observations you mentioned do sound like some sort of dementia.  But they also may be seen in the very elderly.  At a certain point in time, most older people do have a certain amount of brain cell death.  

So functionally, it doesn't matter a great deal which kind of brain dysfunction your grandmother has.  She's getting older and needs family support.  She's going to die, but all of us do.  If you want to be helpful, send her a card or letter a couple times a month, written not email, and tell her what's going on in your life, maybe enclose a joke or a pressed flower, or send her some sweets.",2022-04-23 12:22:41,eudaemoniaa,ua91jz
Alzheimers,Alzheimer's is AWFUL,"I've been blessed to have a very close relationship with my grandparents my whole life.... but a few years ago my grandpa was diagnosed.   


Within the past few months... he has declined rapidly. Everything about it is awful. People can say ""cherish the good days"" but it gets incredibly hard to do so when those become fewer and fewer. It's absolutely crushing to watch someone you look up to turn into a shell of their former self. I want him back. I want more time. I want my grandma to enjoy her remaining years, but instead she's watching the love of her life slowly slip away. She is the strongest person I have ever known but it wears on her so badly. 

The worst part... is that there is nothing more that can be done. It doesn't matter how many times he goes to the doctor or the amount of medicine he's on. We've been told there isn't anything left to do. To know that it will only get worse is sickening. It's unfair.

I know we aren't the first family to ever be affected by this, but it still hurts, it still sucks.","Your feelings are completely valid.  We're all right there with you feeling sad and frustrated and wishing there was a cure. 🥺
I'm so sorry you are going through this. <3
Alzheimer’s has reduced a guy at the memory care unit to a shell. He shuffles around, drooling and moaning. Every two seconds another moan/vocalization. I’ve no doubt he’d be horrified if he saw what this disease did to him.

Keep the faith, friend. 💌
Agreed. It does suck. Wicked bad. 
We're all here in the same storm. 
Keep us updated on how things are going now and again, safe in knowing we can relate.
My Mother was diagnosed with ALZ in November.  She is slipping away steadily.  It's very difficult to experience.  She is still very functional... but nightime is when all of her fears and insecurities pretty much incapacitate her.  My Dad (Stepdad) but oh, what a wonderful man he is.. is a SAINT!  I feel for what you're going through... it's awful... and I'm told (and I know as I'm an RN) that it WILL get worse.  Hugs to you... I know what you're enduring.. You just have to squeeze every bit of positive that you can.  If you'd like to chat.. Please PM me.  <3
I’m so sorry. Your post is so raw and real. You’re right and this isn’t fair.
We share similar sentiments. But grandma is diagnosed in my case. I agree that it's heartbreaking to watch them slowly slip away.. Hang in there, friend.
I don’t know if my husband has Alzheimer’s but he is not the same person I once knew. He does not want to see a Doctor perhaps because he knows there is no cure. His memory is declining, he hasn’t showered or shaved in months and spends his day sitting on the couch, many times asleep. He also seems to crave sweets (don’t know if that is part of this disease). For example, I bought a coffee cake yesterday and had one piece. When I got up this morning it was gone.",2022-04-22 19:42:39,GerttheCat1113,u9s1hh
Alzheimers,lost my mom at 24years old. Would you get the gene test?,"Sorry for the long story. There is a summary of my question and a TLDR at the bottom.

  I want to give some backstory. My mom got early onset Alzheimer's/dementia and over the course of 8years I watched her completely forget who she was, who I was. Near the end before we put her in a care home I was changing her diapers. She would talk to her reflection in the mirror like it was her friend. I'd come out in the middle of the night sometimes to find her just standing there staring into darkness or facing a corner. It was really unnerving. She started getting symptoms when I was about 16 or so and she died when I was 23, my younger brother only 18.  Her dad died of Alzheimer's but his didn't set in until he was around 80years old. Her symptoms started when she was about 40. She always said she wouldn't die of that disease and technically, she didn't. She progressed really rapidly in the care home and In her last few days she became violent, attacking other residents in their sleep. So she was sent to a psych and they prescribed her some medication. Well this medication made her really dizzy and a couple days later she fell and hit her head. She died of brain trauma/internal bleeding. So her statement did stand true in the end, she didn't let that horrible disease be the thing to take her out.. although i believe she died long before her physical body did anyways.. Now none of that is really the point of this post. Since she had early onset that means she carried a specific gene that caused it. This is hereditary so me and my younger brother have a 50/50 chance of carrying it. This gene can be found in a DNA/Gene test.  If I carry this specific early onset gene it is pretty much 100% that I will get early onset Alzheimer's. If i don't carry it there's still always the chance I can get it later in life but it's not a certain thing.

TLDR:  If I don't carry the early onset gene Id get some bit of peace of mind. But if I do carry it there are 2 cons and 2pros that come to mind.
 Con #1- it will most certainly effect  health or life insurance right?
 Con #2- I feel like I'd psych myself out and think about it all the time, worry if any small thing I forget is symptoms setting in etc.
 Pro #1) I could likely start trying tests studies treatments & prevention methods early on and 
Pro #2) I would try harder than I have been to live my life to the absolute fullest knowing that I could die in my 40s. I already live by this to an extent as i know every day isn't guaranteed but I'd definitely spend a lot more time doing the things I love in the next 10years or so.

 I know in the end it comes down to what I want to do but my question for you is, would you want to know?","I’m so sorry you’re going through this and at so young.  My mom had the early onset with similar symptoms (the friends in the mirror!) and it was a bit longer sentence.  She was dx around 60 and died at 74.  I was 30 when she was diagnosed.  

I’ve had a while to think about getting the gene test myself, and I don’t think I want to.  The insurance is a fear of mine as well, probably number one.  But also, I don’t want that existential dread hanging over me.  I know for me, that would hinder how I live.  I think there was a thread a while back and some experts in the gene industry even said they hadn’t tested and wouldn’t want to.  Life’s an uncertainty and just because you have the gene, it doesn’t mean you’ll get it early nor die from it.  Your mom even knew that!

For me, I have a surrogate mom that took me in as ‘like a daughter’.  That’s really helped.  I also have an auntie and a few others who have taken on a grandmother-like role for my daughter.  Surround yourself with people who care, and your mom’s love will feel close.  Take care! And enjoy every day.
Any life insurance offered through work would be a term plan and wouldn’t require a family medical history. 
Any life insurance you purchase on your own will require a family history, but I don’t remember if they specifically ask about dementia. They will ask what age your parents died and what from.  In your case, you mother fell and hit her head and passed from a brain bleed. 

If you plan on purchasing life insurance, do that first before getting testing if it makes you more comfortable. That way you have plausible deniability.

ETA: my mother is 91 and has Lewy Body Dementia.  She had REM sleep disorder for decades that went untreated because she refused to tell her doctor.  Her sister had amyloidosis, which is just a different kind of protein deposit than LBD.  Her other two sisters lived to a ripe old age of mid-90s with absolutely no dementia symptoms, actually one of them just turned 95 on Monday and looks better than some 70yos I know.

My oldest sister has actual diagnosed REM sleep disorder and is being very proactive and in Harvard sleep studies, etc. So as a Family, we’re going to prepare just in case and if we don’t end up with dementia, then all the better. I’m just going to live my life the best I can.
I probably would, and then sign up for all sorts of longitudinal studies.

You should consult a genetic counselor to discuss all these angles.  

Remember, each of us is different, so don't do something just because Redditors say it's a good idea.
Do not get the gene test until you already are paying for long-term care insurance. If you get the gene test and are positive for the possibility of Alzheimer's disease, you will be denied long-term care insurance.

LTC insurance is for care when you're old and can't take care of yourself anymore. It's vital to have, especially if you're at risk for getting it. However, you can't know you have the gene and then buy it.
I’m so sorry about your mom. I’m going through it too and I share your pain. 

I can help answer some of your questions. I’m in physician assistant school and I’m also really interested in genetics, so I’ve done a lot of side research. 

1. Do you have other family members, such as your aunts/uncles and grandparents, on your mothers side who got it EARLY? 

Early onset can happen spontaneously or through the inheritance of specific genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2). The familial genes listed about have a 50/50 chance of inheritance while the spontaneous form does not.  

If your mom had the spontaneous form, which is much more common than the familial form, your risk would be elevated, but NOT 50/50. 

-EARLY = APP, PSEN1, PSEN2
-Alzheimer’s with onset after 65 = APOE 
(There are other types, like frontal-temporal, that have specific genes linked to them)   


2. If you take a commercial test, 23 and me is the only one that provides you with the information. I’m not sure if they give you APP, PSEN1&2 or not. APOE is linked to Alzheimer’s, BUT having it does not mean you’ll get it. 

-other types of Alzheimer’s are linked to different genes. There could be undiscovered genes that have yet to be identified.

-Ancestry will “chip” the genes and report them as the normal variant. The article below is an example of this. A guy took a 23 and Me and it came back with PSEN1. He did an ancestry to look for it and didn’t realize that Ancestry reported the “default” gene. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/opinion/sunday/23andme-ancestry-alzheimers-genetic-testing.html

-commercial DNA tests are not as accurate as medical grade
-we also don’t know enough about the inheritance yet, so taking a test could just cause a bunch of anxiety

3. Prevention!

-Exercise is the best way to prevent/delay it: studies show that daily exercise can help delay the onset by about 1 decade
-don’t smoke
-eat healthy
-keep your blood pressure in check 
-keep your mind active 

4. Realize that science still has a LONG ways to go on completely understanding Alzheimer’s. We still don’t know exactly why it’s triggered early in some people. Maybe there’s an environmental factor that we haven’t discovered yet? Perhaps unidentified protective genes  are involved? What turns the bad genes on and activated them? We just don’t know yet 

5. Seek information from a reliable source! 

-Alzheimer’s association is excellent 
-Cochrane Library is free and PEER REVIEWED! 
it only uses systemic reviews and meta-analyses (It’s a type of research article where the author took several single articles and pooled the results. By pooling the results, you can eliminate bias that a single article might pose).  The reviews are written in a ways thats straight forward, which helps keep it clear. 

https://www.biomedcentral.com/search?query=Early+onset+Alzheimer’s&searchType=publisherSearch

Cochrane Database (peer-reviewed) 
https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com

6. You might be able to enroll in a genetic study that offers testing. I’ve heard that you can decide if you want to know or not. I’m not sure if this gets reported to insurance since it was technically paid for by the researcher and not through insurance. 


Ultimately, taking a test is your own choice and you have a right to know. I would encourage you to use a genetic counselor and not a commercial test.  

I truly tried to find out, but in retrospect, I am happy that my attempts failed. I think it would’ve stressed myself out and probably stopped trying, which could backfire if the test was a false positive.  I think that we have just touched the tip on genetics and this could be completely different in 10 years. Who knows? 

I’m so sorry that you had to go through this so young, it absolutely sucks. Not to mention, you’ve become a mother to your younger brother, which has got to be hard. 

Please reach out if you have any questions. I’m here if you need sound scientific advice or support. We are in this together!
I haven't decided on if I want a genetic test done or not, but I think at the very least watching my dad go through this has shown me that there are steps I need to make sure to take to protect myself in my twilight years. I'm very lucky that my dad had taken care of getting a POA and will long before this became an issue. I'm lucky that he had put aside money for his retirement so I don't have to worry about Medicaid or how to pay for his care. I want to make sure whomever has to make decisions for me when I'm no longer able won't be saddled with more than they need to be should I have something similar happen to me.
Do you know for sure it was genetic and that it is also heredity? I didn't think just because someone has early onset dementia that means their children have a 50% chance of getting it.
Did your mom actually have genetic testing that identified a specific gene?
Did your mom have a hysterectomy by any chance?
I would and then sign up with MAID (in Canada)",2022-04-22 12:55:07,stayinguplatecrying,u9j8yj
Alzheimers,"Need info, serious help",My grandmother has mid to late stage dementia and Alzheimer’s and we’re trying to place her in a facility that can provide the care she needs since we cannot. The only facility near us that can provide the level of care she needs is quoting us about $3000 more than we can afford. Does anyone have any resources that would help us financially? She doesn’t qualify for Medical. And board and care isn’t able to provide the level of care she needs. I’m desperate for any help because we’re running out of time,"We had a combination of insurance, Medicaid, and out of pocket pay. Unfortunately to get any help from medicaid, they require the person receiving care to liquidate pretty much every asset and be below poverty level. The nursing home had case workers that walked us through every step, filled out forms with us, and figure out how to get our payments as low as possible for my dad (which were still about $700/mo out of pocket after all that). Best of luck, it’s so stressful during an already stressful time of life.
When you say she doesn’t qualify for Medical, did you mean Medicaid? And why doesn’t she qualify?
Basically, you're going to have to liquidate all her assets and be below poverty level for Medicaid to kick in. MedicAID is for folks who can't financially make it. MediCARE is for elderly folks. Remember the difference. Aid = help/support. 


Another option is to keep her at home. We are keeping my mom at home for as long as possible and this is typically the norm for Asian families. My father is her full time caregiver and we have in-home assistance but at some point, we may have to put her into a facility even if it means giving up all her assets - she has a small retirement cushion. We can't afford expensive ass facilities that can take care of her and we aren't going to throw her out on the damn street.",2022-04-21 22:45:01,Interesting-Crazy-99,u94bkl
Alzheimers,my grandad has some form of early onset dementia or alzheimer’s. he’s been going downhill all year. what can i expect? how can i help support him and my nana? how do i cope? and more. i have so many questions.,"hello, i am 17. i am ftm (female to male, transgender) but not out to him or many people in my family (although he would almost 100% be supportive. i’m so much sure of the fact he’d be supportive i’m more certain he’d support me then my own mum would) and i am autistic. 

due to my autism i am unsure how i can help, and i don’t think i can process this in the same way as most of my family. but i will figure that out so i am not worried about that. 

i have not had any personal experience with alzheimer’s before. most of my grandad’s siblings had it before they passed away, and he’s 80 now so i guess it was expected for him to get alzheimer’s or something similar. 

his wife, my nanny or nana, is 77. neither can drive and they rely on each other heavily. 

they have been together since they were 15 and 17, turning 18, and celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary last december. 

he’s been my only grandad as my other one passed away before i was born and i’ve never had to properly deal with the passing of a close relative. 

what i am worried about is 2 things; my grandma had a heart attack the day after her husband’s funeral and almost died- and i’m worried that may nana might have the same happens when this horrible disease really makes his quality of life go downhill.

i am also worried because i don’t know what to expect and i have so many questions. 

how long does the decline take to happen?

how do i help him?

how do i help my nana?

how painful is this for him? 

what can i even do?

how much of this can be prevented or halted?

when does he get medical help?

how long will he have to suffer for?

is it a good idea to come out to him or will it confuse him further? 

will he forget who i am?

what do i do?

will it hurt?

will he be okay until shortly before he passes or might he be in pain for a long time before?

are the questions which spring to me.

i don’t know whats going to happen or when and it scares me. i’m close to all 3 of my grandparents; probably more then i am to anyone else in my family, and i’ve never lost anyone as close to me as this, and i’m worried about when i’ll lose him. i’ve never even seen anyone seriously sick long term in my immediate family before. i’ve been the really sick person as i had cancer as a 12 year old and went through chemo for 2 and a half years. but i’ve never been on the other side of this so i have no clue what to expect when seeing him seriously i’ll. 

i don’t know what i’m hoping to achieve from this post. i guess it’s a vent. i think i’m looking for support. mostly guidance and answers tho; though i’m not sure anyone can give them.

thank you for any and all help","Oh sweetie, I’m so sorry you are dealing with this.  You sound like an absolutely wonderful grandchild, and you are asking all the right questions on how to best support your granddad and nana. 
Alzheimer’s can be very upsetting to everyone involved - for the family taking care of their loved one, as well as the family member with Alzheimer’s.  It’s hard watching someone you love struggle to remember things, struggle to do simple day to day things, or always recognize someone they love dearly. 

Depending on the severity of his Alzheimer’s, he could be prescribed a few medications that could help manage his symptoms, but there really isn’t anything yet to stop the progression of the disease.  My mom has had Alzheimer’s for about 5 years, and she’s still here with me, though some days she seems worse than others. What I’m saying is that you could have many good years left with your grandad. And Alzheimer’s is not physically painful - it’s emotionally hard.

I think the best way to help is to spend time engaging with your granddad - talk and reminisce with him whoever you can, and always try to be patient with him. And help by supporting your nana! Ask her how you can help her support your granddad.  Do you have your driver’s license? Maybe you could run errands if your Nana needs something. Maybe it’s an option to have a home health aid come in to help with your granddad and give some relief to your nana, if she’ll have it.

I’m sorry I don’t have all the answers you need, but this is a wonderful subreddit with folks who support each other, and they can offer way more advice then me. Just know your grandparents love you no matter what.
Wow, you've been through the wars yourself, that's for sure.

This is hard. It's just hard for everybody. I highly recommend you look at the brief pamphlet [Understanding the Dementia Experience](http://www.dementiacarestrategies.com/12_pt_Understanding_the_Dementia_Experience.pdf) to start. Also, the Alzheimer's Association at alz.org can be a great resource, as with this description of [dementia stages](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/stages).

I can't answer every question, but here are some. Alzheimer's generally doesn't cause pain--it can mess with emotions and can make it hard to convey when you have pain from other causes, but it's not painful in its own right. There are medications that can help with memory but they're not right for everybody, and they don't stop Alzheimer's from progressing, they just slow it down. The speed of decline is highly variable; usually it's been progressing for a while before it gets caught, too. So you may have years, but you also have a wakeup call not to waste time.

Caring is hard on carers, it's true. Things you might be able to do to help: drive them places if you can, or even just accompany them on the bus. Spend time with your grandpa so your nana can go out on her own and see friends, or even spend time with him at their house so that her focus can be elsewhere for a while. Do some loads of laundry for them. Cook a meal for them or drop by with treats they enjoy. Help with internet-related ways to get support--I'm guessing you're in the UK, so your local council and Age UK would be good places to investigate to see if they're eligible for services that would help.

I would see how your grandfather's doing before I made decisions about coming out. That's something where you need to think about protecting yourself as well, and no matter how much he loves you his illness might make it harder to see you as you are when his memories of who you were a decade ago are so much stronger. That's neither a ""don't"" nor a ""do""--it's a ""you need more information.""

Most of the time, people with Alzheimer's are up and around and hanging around the house much like they always have--they're not in bed being nursed, and most of the time they don't actually know they have dementia (that's actually part of the disease, so telling them is pointless)--they just think the TV remote has gotten really buggy, or the calendar is wrong, or that they put the clothing on wrong because it wasn't made right. So if there are things you two used to enjoy doing together they might still be fun to do. 

As far as being non-neurotypical goes, it may be an advantage; you may recognize some things that are difficult for him are things that have tended to be hard for you, too (sensory overload, for instance, can happen easily with some people with dementia). And in general, you sound like a loving grandchild to a loving grandfather, and it's hard to go wrong just telling your grandfather how much you love him and talking about all the ways he's terrific.

I'm sorry you're going down this road, but I think you will travel in a way that makes your grandparents proud and grateful.
You’re doing great. Good idea to start researching now. The book *The 36 Hour Day* is the most commonly cited “guidebook”.  If he is in early stages, just talk to him a lot, try to make good memories, ask him about old family stories or those from his childhood, your parents childhood. Explore some of the local tourist attractions you never visited. Enjoy mundane nice things and the abilities he does have like walking around and enjoying sunshine, fresh air, music. Record his good days, take photos. Later on, he may get very mean, say very hurtful things; before his cognitive symptoms show. You’ll want to have those good memories to remind yourself that this new mean guy isn’t actually granddad. Look up the term Sundowning to learn how to prevent it. Medications can help a lot such as Aricept and Seroquel. 

Most important is to prevent hospitalization and physical injury in general. Each hospitalization accelerates the dementia, for example if someone becomes bedridden even a short time it becomes hard to practice walking again. So it is important to try and prevent falling. Grab bars in the shower, shower chair, good quality shoes, extra furniture and stuff in the house and on the floor, that is hard for him to maneuver around. If he has hearing loss and it is not yet addressed, he needs to get hearing aids or at least a Pocket Talker. 

continue having conversations about interesting, stimulating, nuanced  topics. If he doesn’t understand or forgets something don’t correct him just change topic or move on. It’s common that people say “don’t argue or correct him” which I always found rather useless. Find reasons to postpone his demands or to redirect. 

If you come out, you may find that it simply doesn’t stick. in which case you decide if it’s worth it to you to go over it each time.

As it gets closer into mid-stage, he may forget who you are but it is patchy and varies by day. He may suffer from the Capgras delusion. Or he may say “you look a lot like my little granddaughter” in which case you can ask him to tell you all about his favorite things about her. You can offer to sit and write a letter to his grandkid that he dictates to you. And you can drop your girl mask in this situation.

How long it lasts, it all depends. My 90 year old grandmother practically fast-forwarded from mid to end stage when she broke her hip and never bounced back. Then there are people who suffer no physical illness and live for 20 years with the disease still walking around blissfully unaware.",2022-04-21 17:50:58,ActualDepressedPOS,u8yjxp
Alzheimers,Family friend pushing me to get POA for mother (65F),"In effort to make this as short as possible,
I (30F) have a strained relationship with my alcoholic mother (65F)  who is mentally ill, and recently diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s. 

My parents are low-income, and have no savings or no plan for the future. They live about 2 hours away from me. Father is negligent and does not care/ doesn’t think what’s happening is a concern. He will not communicate with me or update me about her condition, and is afraid of speaking to me on the phone because she typically walk in and accuse him of gossiping about her. I have one sibling who is estranged and out of the picture, so ultimately no family support at all. The only saving grace is that they do qualify for Medicaid, but I have no idea what benefits IF any will be available to them for assisted living, etc. and need to figure this out. Maybe speaking with a social worker would be a good next step?

I am barely able to take care of myself due to generalized anxiety (can’t drive on the interstate, for example) and it’s all I can do to function and work at my new and very stressful, demanding job. 

There is a family friend who has recently started communicating with me, who is helping me parents by bringing them food, driving my mother to appointments, etc. I am VERY thankful and appreciative that she is willing to help out. She has expressed concern regarding their financial affairs, and is pressuring me to get POA, inform HR at my employer about my mothers condition in anticipation of me needing of take time off of work to take care of mother, etc. 

With everything I have on my plate, I am not able to or consenting to jeopardize my situation at work to take care of my mother. Nor do I want the responsibilities that come with POA. Due to my stressful situation at work, I am unable to attend my OWN doctors appointments, and have had at least 3 appointments of my own come up that I’ve “no show” due to me actually forgetting to go, because of my demanding work schedule. I can’t even see a therapist regularly, which I need. 

So how am I supposed to drop everything and risk jeopardizing my job, my livelihood, to drive to a different city that’s 2 hours away and keep up with my mothers appointments? 

I guess I’m at a loss because I have no experience with any of this, or no family support. I grew up poor, so I have no family members who can help support me financially. My parents fucked up my childhood and I don’t want to be robbed of a decent adulthood. I don’t have the capacity to be a caretaker and don’t know what to do.  

Has anyone been in this situation or can offer any advice?","That sounds like a very difficult place to be. You may try contacting a social worker in their state and telling them this. There may be help available that doesn’t have to come from you.
I'm sorry you're in this position; there are no great solutions in any direction. If your father is legally capable of handling their affairs it might be a tall order for you rather than him to get POA for your mother anyway, and if he'd put up a fight that might just make everything worse. You might want to call the Alzheimer's 24-hour helpline at 800.272.3900 and ask for a counselor. I hear great reports.
A POA is something your mother will have to consent to and sign on her own. So if she's bad enough that a friend is helping out, then that ship has sailed. What the family friend is thinking of would be a court appointed guardianship. 

A social worker that specializes in the elderly is probably a good idea, at the very least so you can feel more comfortable knowing what options are out there even if you personally aren't equipped for caregiving. 

Unless you're in a state with filial responsibility laws, don't feel like everything needs to fall on your shoulders just because they're your parents. It's okay if you can't be their caretaker.
You are under absolutely ZERO obligation to take on care for your parents. They are grown adults who made their bed. As for the family friend: the fact that she is willing and able to help is great! It doesn't mean that she can demand that you get involved in a  situation that is likely to hurt you. 

Put your own oxygen mask on first! If there's nothing left afterwards, so be it. Absolutely don't get that POA if the responsibility is not something you can reasonably carry. And tell that 'friend' to shove it. She is probably biting of more than she can chew and wants you to go down with her. It's a common response in abusive relationships, described as boat steadying (vs rocking the boat, which is what your parents are doing).

I work in dementia care as a psychologist. Family trauma can be huge and it doesn't go away, just because they are sick and old. In fact it can turn even more vicious due to feelings of guilt and obligation.  You are a good person, and you may choose to stay at a distance. This is not your responsibility, it's theirs. Take care.
Call the department of social services, particularly the part that deals with elderly people, in your parents' county of residence.  Explain that they need a competent adult to manage their affairs and that no one in the family is available to do so - one estranged, one just too stressed as it is.  Then leave the matter in a caseworker's hands.

Your friend is ""right"" as far as next steps to take but does not seem to comprehend that you cannot be the one to do it.  There's no law that says all those caregiver functions must be taken over by a relative.  In your family's case, there just isn't anyone to do it.

Be well and take care of yourself.
POA does not have to be you. You’re absolutely right that it’s stressful and like having a second job. You can have an outside person be in charge of her affairs. The family friend is right that she will need this, but she is not right that it has to be you. The Alzheimer’s association hotline can help walk you through how to do this.",2022-04-21 10:11:33,creynolds092,u8ok0v
Alzheimers,Not sure what to do,"I'm really struggling with how to help my parents.

My mom (70) clearly has some cognitive deficits, which have been getting worse for the past 5-6 years. It started with occasional word-finding problems, but now she is confused about lots of things (events that are recent and in the distant past). I know she is seeing a neurologist, but my parents do not communicate any of this with me (41) or my sibling (38). I don't understand if they are trying to protect us, or just have their heads in the sand and want to pretend that there are no problems. If there has been a formal diagnosis, nobody has shared that information with us.

My Dad (78) is completely sharp mentally, but really really stubborn.  He has made it very clear that he has no intention of ever leaving their house (which has 5 bedrooms, no proximity to any public transit, no bedrooms or bathrooms on the first floor, and has a large yard that they have to maintain). For now, this is going OK-ish, but if something ever happens to my Dad (even something temporary, like having a minor fall, or needing to recover in a rehab facility), I'm scared that my Mom won't be able to survive on her own. She still drives, but I'm scared to ride with her. Sometimes she will get lost, or simply forget where she's going after she leaves the house. I can also see her forgetting to turn off the stove and starting a fire.

Both my sibling and I live out of state (a plane ride away).  I don't know what to do. I think my Mom would actually enjoy being in a senior living community with graduated levels of care (she's a really sociable and generally happy / agreeable person, and she would really enjoy participating in planned group activities). We're still at the point where she could participate in the planning. There's a facility near where they live that is really nice (they have multiple friends who live there! they love the on-site restaurant!), and others that are closer to me or my sibling.

How do I address this?

Note: I actually have the ability to move closer (remote work option), but I don't want to become their full-time caretaker, nor do I want to take responsibility for maintaining their house.  I could conceivably use this as leverage to negotiate with my Dad (I'll move nearby, but only if you agree to downsize into senior living. Otherwise you are on your own!), but this sounds kind of awful.

Not sure what to do.","I really don't have much advice other than whatever move you decide to make, don't procrastinate. My grandparents (moms parents) went downhill really fast, and they were never willing to have the discussions and or make the proper moves to protect themselves when things happen (and unfortunately things happen). My grandfather passed away rather quick and my mom is now the caregiver to her mother with dementia. They planned too late and my mom was really overwhelmed with having to care for their house, sell it, etc. while also grieving and taking care of her very sick mother. Family 100% helped her, but a lot was on her. My grandparents were also not poor enough to get the help they needed assistance wise, so senior living and in home care is just not something we can afford. 

I am not saying any of this to be rude, or scare you. I am just trying to make the point that you need to start having discussion, get POA and maybe discuss living options ASAP. Don't wait until a major life event. 

Also, senior living is extremely expensive, as I am sure you know. So don't go into that lightly either. Sounds like your family might be living comfortably so luckily you have options. 

I am sorry you're having to go through this. It's never easy. Wish you all the best.
5 bedroom house sounds like you have enough money (and space) to hire live in assistance if need be. 

any grandkids that could maybe move in temporarily?
I'm sorry I don't have an answer to the primary question, but one thing I would suggest is that you discuss (and if possible convince them of) giving you power of attorney (POA) and healthcare POA for both of them.  You should also discuss other protections like ways to protect them against fraud (a trust?) since your mom may become more inclined to allow herself to be manipulated.  Ultimately, the decisions are your dad's, but part of denial of the reality of the situation is increasing one's belief and actions that they are in control, so discussing the areas where they (or he) may lose control, such as the things you pointed out are important.  

FWIW, (admittedly not much), all this planning is easier to discuss and understand than it is to do.  I created a trust years ago (wife has alz) but still have not put anything in it, set up beneficiaries, etc.  It can be intimidating, so stay strong & get help.",2022-04-21 01:48:18,ImportantEmergency91,u8gi13
Alzheimers,Advice on relieve anxiety for my grandma,"I’m here in US and my grandma is with my parents and grandpa back in my home country. She’s 78 and her dementia has deteriorated rapidly in past 2 years and I am just looking for advice to make her life a little more bearable. 

She’s always anxious, never want to be left alone. 99% of the time she has company and even during that time she’s very anxious always trying to find other people in the house or assuming she’s in someone else’s house and wants to back to her home.

She has no interest in watching television, listening to music etc. So basically she has no way to kill time. I believe she’s mentally suffering every day and it also impacts my grandpa the most as it sometimes gets frustrating for him. 

Is there any way we can relieve some of her anxiety and make her calm and find an activity that can actually keep her busy couple of hours a day. We have tried a couple of doctors and medicines and nothing really helps out :(","We got fidget boards, fidget toys, a box of old greeting cards from her friends and family, a fidget blanket, fidget maps, and my granny still chooses to fold her blankets over and over and over and over again. She used to clean the kitchen repeatedly but she can’t walk anymore without assistance. 

The fidget blanket is pretty good but it only keeps her attention for a short while. We give her stacks of bills to sort sometimes. It sounds awful, but it’s what she did her whole life, so it seems therapeutic for her in some ways?
Have you tried Lexapro?",2022-04-20 02:53:23,Upset-Statement-7288,u7qfls
Alzheimers,"""who is you?""","It is starting. But as bad as this is going to sound, I am not overwhelmed with sadness at this particular thought. 

This week has been unusually difficult. Not only has she had diarrhea every hour for days (anyone got a red bull??), but I also have some things in my life going haywire. 

This morning during a bathroom run at 2am as I was picking her up out of bed, she stated ""who is you?""... She has long forgotten dates, locations, aquaintances, but It's the first time she hasn't recognized anyone that's family. 

If someone had told me she was saying that before we (my 2 yo and I) started staying with her, I would have thought it was the saddest thing. But I'm so tired this week that in my head I'm thinking the same thing! 

WHO IS YOU? Where is my sweet grandmother who never had a bad thing to say? Who is this person with this constant grimace that appears to be some permanent under bite? Why does it seem your goal is to burp loudly on purpose and then grunt afterward like it was a painful surprise? Where is the considerate person who thought of others too? 

I know I'm cruel. I know it's not her fault and she is in there somewhere. But one of her main carers is starting cancer treatment soon. I know she won't be able to keep up her schedule forever. Sometimes when I think about doing this forever, I feel like I'm having an asthma attack. The kind where the panic sets in long before the end. 

Anyway, this post is just a vent I guess. I am trying so very hard but I'm breaking a little too. But like many of you (I'm sure) I save my breakdowns for 2am reddit sessions so that no one else can tell just how much I can't breathe. 

Kudos to all you who are the real angels. I read some of these posts last night during many wakeups and just think how amazing it is that people can love that hard.","This is a beautiful post. Thank you for sharing. It's so much easier to love from a distance, and you're right, the woman you knew is probably mostly gone. That doesn't mean that person still there doesn't need love and support, but it is understandable that you feel she is a stranger. I don't know what else to say. Try to keep some strength and love in your heart, but don't punish yourself if it feels hard to come by, I guess is all I want to say.
It sounds like you are doing a wonderful job supporting her as best you can. You are only a human, and while yes the changes she’s having are sad, they are also incredibly frustrating and taxing on YOUR physical and mental health too. 

It sounds like she has a stomach thing going on and people with dementia are often more disoriented when they are sick, things might improve when she’s well. 

Know that you are a badass for doing this and maybe try to talk to yourself like a friend would talk to you when you’re feeling down on yourself.
I hope at 2 am when you read these comments you hear us all cheering for you. 

I've worked in the long-term care field for a long time and always have a deep level of admiration for family members like you. I also see so many families who don't have a deep love/desire to live in their loved ones changing world with dementia far more often.

Coming here so often reminds me that sometimes doing our best is all we need to do.....and that's more than good enough. 

""Who is you?"" You're the wonderful person who stepped up when so many others wouldn't.

Alzheimers,Song Recommendation for those searching,"Hello guys,

Back in 2016 my grandfather passed. He had a heart attack while cleaning the roof unfortunately. He was really stable and looked after his wife, my grandmother, really well. 

At his funeral, I remember my grandma saying to my uncle that she was “losing her mind”. This was the first sign, and we quickly got her tested. A little after my grandfather passed we learned she had Alzheimer’s. 

In an effort to cope, I turned to music. For those who are looking for a resource and don’t mind country music, I’d recommend Riley Green’s “Numbers on the Cars”. It tells the story of him and his grandfather. I’ve never been able to relate more to a song. 

I like the song, and it still brings a tear to my eye even after she’s passed. 

Hopefully it helps another who went through / is going through what i am.","The song I always turn to is Yesterday by the Beatles. I never got to meet my boyfriends grandma who passed from Alzheimer’s, but apparently this was the only song she could remember word for word. Now I visit an elderly man with Alzheimer’s every week to sing and play guitar for him- so I sing and play Yesterday as well and he loves it",2022-04-19 10:47:23,Benjiboy50fonz,u76vw8
Alzheimers,Help with options for restricting iphone usage,"Hi everyone. My grandmother has been dx for over a year now, with memory issues/dementia onset for quite some time prior to that. She is now living with my mom with her , myself, and my brother as caregivers. My mom has POA. 

Her whole life she's had unhealthy relationships with men and that hasn't settled down at all. Only now she doesn't have the judgement to not give out personal information or enter into relationships with sketchballs. For example she's currently ""engaged to marry"" 3 different men (fake profiles) that she has contacted through Facebook messenger. She's also chatting with strange men via texting, WhatsApp, kik, Google hangouts, Snapchat, etc. She's also previously downloaded tinder in recent history. Sometimes she's initiating the conversation and sometimes they are. 

Our dilemma is that we aren't sure how to manage this---we can't keep letting her put herself at risk but we also don't want to take away her phone completely or prevent her from contacting friends/family that are out of state- most of which is done through Facebook.


She uses an iPhone and is about to get a new one under my mom's phone plan so it would be the right timing to get the controls setup on her phone via an app or whatever else. Ideally it would allow us to see what's going on & remotely block people or delete apps, but I'm not sure that's even possible. Something that could be ran on and Android device as well would be ideal 😬

Wondering if anyone has ran into anything similar/knows of an app that could handle this. Or if we are off base all together in how we are approaching it...","Yes! I need a setting that only accepts calls and txt from a white list that we can add to. This would rock.
A bit off topic but the ability to use a smartphone is one of the first things to go with Alzheimer's.  If she is able to use it so well as to download new apps, set up accounts, and chat regularly using these apps then that is pretty impressive.  Is she more of an MCI state or does she actually have dementia? It seems her judgement is suspect from what you've said.

Are her other more instrumental ADLs still intact such as driving, cooking, using TV remotes, etc?  

As far as ways to lock out these apps,  iphones have a screen time setting where you can change content and privacy restrictions which can block apps.",2022-04-18 19:06:32,tomfools,u6q7nh
Alzheimers,Do you have POA?,"Mom is physically active and appears healthy.  She's not old. She rambles a bit and loses her train of thought easily.  She has sticky notes all over the kitchen. And money (which she always handled) now confuses her. She can no longer differentiate between twelve hundred and twelve thousand.

&nbsp;

We visit her every day. We thought she was fine.  Last month she gave a stranger 87k.  She is NOT wealthy.  Thank God her bank takes 48 hours to process international bank wires.  She will get most of it back. 

&nbsp;


It's like her red flags don't work anymore.  Does anyone have POA?  I want her to have her checking. But I don't want her to be able to touch her savings or retirement account.  I want to get an alert when her checking goes under 5k or when she takes out more than $500 cash.


&nbsp;

I'm so not ready for this.  But with my sister, we'll build a security bubble around Mom. Just wanted to ask if we are on the right track.  Lawyer says we can sign POA paperwork next week.  What are we forgetting?","If you don't have a POA or trust do it now while she is still mostly independent. If she can't consent to it on her own you'll have a much harder route to take.
Get POA.  But also understand what it is. It will not remove her access to her assets; it only gives you the ability to do things in her name.  I'm not a lawyer or even knowledgeable, but discuss putting her assets in a trust.  That way, unless she is the trustee (she should not be, that would be you and/or your siblings or others if you want), she can not access those assets.
Yes. Both POAs. Get passwords, insurance policy info, car titles, investment account info. Get all the bills paid online from a bank draft or a cash back credit card that is bank drafted. You might change the passwords on all the dating or scam sites.

When I took over my wife's check book she was giving to every charity that sent her a plea. I took her name off all those lists.
Absolutely get a POA. I share one with my sister for health which was perfect timing. It was executed just before she had an accident and needed emergency surgery. My uncle has financial POA and it allows us to protect her from people who would like nothing better than to take advantage of her kindness and naivety.
I do not have a POA, I have a conservatorship and a guardianship.  The problem with a POA is they can be revoked at any time and I know my father in law would revoke it the minute he got frustrated.  I wanted something stronger.
When you get the POAs, make sure you have a separate one for financial and medical.  Mom's have both sets of powers on one document and it has caused problems.
Yes, we arranged durable and medical POAs years ago when our estate plan was done.  Once my DH was clearly unable to make his own medical decisions, the medical POA was activated.  

But I started limiting his loss potential a few years ago.  I took over managing the checkbook, removed his password access to Amazon, closed all his credit card accounts, and gave him cash for purchases which involves less risk than a credit card (you can only lose the face amount, not future purchases).  

The sooner the better on things like this.  I'm glad your mother will get most of that $87K back, but it's scary.
Get an elder lawyer, if you don't already have one. They can help you get everything you need, and tell you the best way to go about things for the future
Tell her the POA is so that you can get things done on her behalf like pay her bills and consent to surgery in case she is hit by a bus suddenly one day. She may not think she has any judgment problems and telling her so may make her paranoid that you are gaslighting her.
By the way, POA is not something that you sign only when someone starts going downhill. They must be of sound mind to grant it. POA cannot override the person’s free will. Only to carry out her interests on her behalf.  However with POA you can use online banking to set daily max spending, alerts for online credit card usage, alerts when below a certain balance etc
One of the first small steps we made was to change their card to a pre paid one. (Told them the old one had expired). Never had more than a few hundred on it and could monitor spending remotely.
Try to get all her online banking set up with alerts and emails to the POA. It may be necessary to look into a conservatorship/guardianship soon as well before all her money disappears and she literally signs her life away. Its hard enough with elderly folks who are technically not demented at least by a doctor but somehow fall for all the online, get rich quick scams that show up in their email box or otherwise. (The common ones right now are the Amazon FBA scammers out of India). I have stories on that too, but I'll save it for now, but there are plenty of these situations spelled out on YouTube. These people purposely target the elderly, and will suck them dry of every dollar in their bank account, and are absolutely heartless and ruthless. 😣
If she is aware that the 87k is a problem, you may be able to get conservatorship. After my dad gave away all of his money, he agreed. He still forgets and uses his allowance to open new accounts, but he’s not in legal trouble anymore.
And here is advice for the ones working to get POA or conservatorship for a loved one, particularly if you have children -

GET YOUR OWN AFFAIRS IN ORDER!

My wife and I were required to write wills, set up POAs, health care proxies, etc., when we adopted a child 27 years ago.  Having that all set up before my wife started declining was a godsend.  It’s still hard enough to get the POA to all the organizations which will need it.

Make a note to review/revise it every 5 years or so.  Circumstances change, relationships change.  Your documents should change, too.
Everyone else has covered all the big things, so ill just say good luck to you, hope it all goes smoothly!
Also, when you set up all this paperwork, put in back up provisions.  Plan B and C.  What happens if the person handling everything suddenly passes first? Spell out what happens just in case.  And put in secondary beneficiaries.   Your kids and grandkids will thank you.
Yes we have it.  Mom doesnt handle any money at all any more and Step Dad's spending is closely monitored because he started making questionable financial decisions.
Set up all of her assets in a trust. Get a financial power of attorney and a medical power of attorney. Do all of this ASAP because if the lawyer has any doubts about your mom’s understanding and comprehension they cannot proceed or their license to practice will be on the line. My mom and I went through this last August with my grandparents. Fortunately they had set up the trust several years ago. They decided they wanted my mom to take over the finances. They signed off as trustees and my mom was made sole trustee and financial POA. While they were at it they updated the medical POA and named me for that role. Thank god it all happened when it did because a week after the paperwork was filed my grandpa fell and broke his shoulder. I had to jump in to make arrangements to get him into skilled nursing and get my grandma with him as a respite care. Since then they have moved to assisted living however my grandma’s Alzheimer’s has progressed significantly and my grandpa was just diagnosed. Good luck!
Geeez, I feel like I wrote this post myself. Priority is getting the POA. I got POA last summer and have been working on getting everything under control for her. We have a support worker visiting her twice a week, and I'm setting up a separate checking account/debit card that she can use for small purchases and all her house expenses will be on autopay and coming out of another account where most of the money will sit. And I won't set that account up on her debit card, so in case someone tries to scam her she won't actually have access to anything except like $500.

Glad you're getting most of that money back! Wow.
Get POA!",2022-04-18 17:02:38,Gold-Eyed-Cat,u6nhh9
Alzheimers,Stage 6 or 7? Just need insight,"First time poster. My dad is 68 and was diagnosed with Alzheimer/vascular dementia around 2012. Today my mom is is full time caregiver - help walking, feeding, etc. as far as his interactions - he is familiar with my voice not really names. Not really talkative but says some words here and there. Just curious if it was 6 or 7 and basically how long he has? Sorry just a bit overwhelmed","Our doctor absolutely refuses to name or imply stages in the disease.  I didn’t understand why at first, but now I know everyone’s journey is different.  My mother exhibits many late stage behaviors but can fully clothe, bathe and feed herself.  It’s impossible to put a timeline on it.
I am a hospice nurse in the U.S., we use something called a Functional Assessment Scale to quickly determine where to stage someone with Alzheimer’s. The person might not even qualify for our services because there’s not enough evidence of decline. 
When there is decline we usually start to see that they’re no longer eating/drinking (unless being forced), they’re sleeping more (most of the day), they might have more episodes of not being able to hold their bowels and bladder. They might have more problems swallowing which can lead to aspiration pneumonia etc. As others have mentioned it’s impossible to predict exactly when death will occur 

You mentioned being overwhelmed, do you have outside support from a medical team? Not sure where you live but perhaps if available you can reach out to a hospice agency to have an evaluation done, that might mean more help for you and your mom. And hospice doesn’t mean giving up hope it really means improving quality of life and providing extra support to patients/their families as well.
Can't say. Get him checked out medically and ask their opinion. People can remain in that state a long time if their care is good.
My dad is in a similar stage. He needs help with everything and is tired whenever we see him. Hell sort of smile and try to talk. He also gets up in middle of the night. And my doctor would only every talk about it three stages. Mild, medium, severe and my dad is definitely in the third stage. It sounds like you are in a similar position. Maybe it's unwise for me to say that...based on other comments
There isn't a timeline.   People can spend years in a stage, or months in a stage, and doctors can't predict how long it's going to be.

I'm sorry.  I wish I knew, too.
Have never heard it being given levels before. Where is the source of the numbers?
My mom seems to transitioned into stage 7 Alz around 2017. Stage 6 for sure in late 2016. The last stage has a 2 1/2 to 4 year time frame before end of life occurs from what I have read online, but like others say no one knows for sure. My most conservative estimate I have for my mom is that she has been in stage 7 for over 4 years now. She became immobile almost exactly 1 1/2 years ago. Her doctor had even put her hospice 2 years ago and then took her off again in December 2021. So it varies from subject to subject. It really does seem in my mom's case though she is very close to the end and won't make it past 2022.",2022-04-17 16:21:54,brownpenn,u5vcgz
Alzheimers,Has anyone else personally seen the link between fake sugar and Alzheimer’s?,"I’ve read a lot about the connection and it makes me so angry that these chemicals are legal to be sold without a warning. I feel I have noticed the connection big time. My grandma drinks diet soda like it’s water and always has and now she’s in the last phase of having Alzheimer’s. When I mentioned the connection to my mom, she told me the only other person she ever knew with it was her friends mom a while back that had it come on very early and she drank diet soda like it was water as well. My other grandmother always has refused to touch fake sugar. She is 90 and totally with it. Drives, lives alone, etc. I am pregnant and have stayed away from these diet drinks after reading about how bad they are for unborn babies. Anyone else seriously pissed that this poison exists?? I’m mad!!!!! Why is it approved for human consumption?? And available so readily??? Wtf","My brother always swore real sugar was best. Never drank any kind of soda. He has alzheimers. Every month there is a new cause, or potential cure in the news
My mother and aunt (sisters) both lived on Tab before switching to Diet coke/pepsi.  Both in their 80s now.  Mother has alz, aunt does not.  
While I don't disagree with you on all the crap they put in our food and drink, simply avoiding diet drinks won't do it.
My mother with Alzheimer's never ate/drank artificial sweeteners but is diabetic. I don't think we can blame food on its own.
My SO has ALZ and never drank diet soda.
I don’t know where this link is coming from. Sugar is not great for you regardless but to chisel down an enormous disease with multiple prongs to it, to something as basic as sugar intake, is really almost an insult. The copious amounts of it that are consumed in the US alone would mean a much bigger percentage of Americans would have the disease. My dad has it and my grandmas (his mother) had and neither of them were avid sweets eaters and my dad certainly did not drink much soda or artificially sweetened drinks. The phrase Correlation does not imply causation comes to mind for this.
I worry about the unintended consequences of fake sugar as well, but I haven’t seen this issue in my loved one with Alz. He rarely ate/ drank products with fake sugar.
My aunt was in a study at Vanderbilt and at the time, around 6 years ago, they were thinking any drinks with aspartame could be a cause. She always drank the Wal Mart brand flavored waters back in the 90’s that had aspartame.. I mean that could possibly be a reason? Obviously no one knows, but everyone in my family now tries to stay away from it.
Artificial sweeteners are the most studied consumable on the planet and there is certainly no connection between them and Alzheimer's disease.  Any study that says there is one is very suspect because there are dozens of gigantic studies that found no links at all.
Well it's not exactly news that aspartame is bad for the brain and for health in general.  So those who drink it ""like water"" should be making an informed decision if they follow the news at all.  I would remind you that sodas sweetened with natural sugar are also extremely unhealthy, contributing to our obesity epidemic.

A nurse-practitioner in a geriatrics clinic said we must stop drinking it entirely.  We decided to keep drinking diet drinks but only one a day.  Our philosophy is if you drink a LOT of the stuff, yes it's bad for you, but maybe in limited quantities, not such a problem.  Anyway, we are phasing it out.",2022-04-17 08:04:25,Normal-Fall2821,u5loiv

Alzheimers,I’m sick of my family asking if my grandmother can do things and not believing me that she can’t,"For some background, I was raised by my moms side mainly. My mom and grandmother who I will call nanny here. A few months ago I visited my dads parents across the country to help watch my grandma because my grandpa was having a hip replacement. My nanny, mom and I last saw them when we all visited like 12 or so years ago. 

My mom and nanny  have both asked multiple times about if she can do things, like read and I’ve told them she can’t. It’s like they don’t believe me. They’ll say things like “she can’t read a short letter from us?” Snd they push it like I’m going to realize they’re talking about something smaller but I tell them she can not ever read at any time. When I was there and upset at my grandma being angry at me, they kept pushing ways to help her remember who I am... she doesn’t even know my grandpa is her husband and she doesn’t know she had children.. they would push and push ways to help her remember.. and  say things like “say you’re Jeff’s daughter” “say you’re my grandma”. Just the other day, again when we sent Easter cards , my nanny sent a prayer book and asked and I told her she can not read it. She kept asking and saying “she can read the card though, right? If it’s short? She has to be able to read that” I had to tell her she won’t remember the word she read before even if she can understand the letters together. Alzheimer’s is some scary stuff.. and I get it’s hard to believe without seeing it. That this can happen to a persons brain so quickly, who was so quick in the mind just a decade ago. But I’m not lying or exaggerating and it’s annoying that they don’t believe it. I’m sick of being told to call her grandma to help her remember or them claiming she’ll know who a gift is from","I totally understand. My mum's only 64 and can't read or even understand what people say anymore. She moved into a care home last year and most members of my family haven't seen her since pre-covid times, so trying to explain just how bad she is now is really difficult. People don't seem to understand how quickly this illness can make someone deteriorate. 

I don't have any advice, but I empathize completely.
I think they don't want to believe it; they'd rather believe you've misunderstood the situation. 

One thing worth trying is to send them [this great Jennifer Ghent-Fuller article](http://www.dementiacarestrategies.com/12_pt_Understanding_the_Dementia_Experience.pdf) about dementia, and say ""Before you ask me any questions, please read this in full."" You can send them back to the article if they have questions.

But also you can simply refuse to go down that line of questioning. ""Mom, I'm the caretaker and the expert here. If you're not going to believe what I tell you, we'll talk about something else. How's the crabgrass back home?"" ""But can't she just..."" ""Have you been using Roundup or just pulling by hand?"" You get the gist--it's kind of similar to your grandma in a way in that you don't put in effort to make them understand something that's difficult to understand, you just don't talk about it if it's going to make your hard work harder. Just because you're asked a question doesn't mean you have to answer it.
That sounds maddening.

Can I suggest videoing a conversation with her?  Maybe that will get through to your relatives that your grandma is not who she was.
Nothing like being gaslit by folks who don't want to visit because 'it's too hard to see her like that.'

Sorry lady. We're not alone. :hugs:
I'm sorry 😔 your family is in denial. Hugs for you.
I feel you. I get so annoyed explaining to one of my aunts how this disease works all of the time. I just want to scream at her to use Google.
Sorry this is happening. It’s as if they could grasp it if she was impaired but not totally. Don’t you get the vibe that they would relax if she could read something short but just not a lot of words!
Distant relatives will believe what they want to believe, and often tell the closer relatives how to do things differently.  This is very common.  

You can try to address this indirectly.  So for instance:

Distant Relative:  She can read still, can't she?

You:  Not as far as I can tell.  I never see her reading.

Distant relative:  but she could read a card, at least, something short like that?

You:  It's hard to tell, because I never see her reading.  Sometimes I read the card out to her.

Distant relative:  You shouldn't do that, because then she will stop trying to read and will lose the ability.

You:  I see your point, but it's always hard to know what to do.",2022-04-17 07:56:04,Normal-Fall2821,u5ljqu
Alzheimers,Someone very close to me was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers at only 26 years old. What does a diagnosis like this even mean?,"I can't find any information online whatsoever about someone so young getting a diagnosis like this. The absolute youngest I can find information on was someone who was 31.

What can I even expect here? I'm terrified.","You got me - that is extraordinarily young.  It's possible it was a misdiagnosis, not based on a full assessment but just general screening tests.  There are things that can mimic Alzheimer's, such as alcoholism or some metabolic diseases; also I think I have read Downs' syndrome is associated with early onset Alzheimer's - maybe - don't quote me on that.
26?? Omggg this is so scary! My dad has memory problems from drinking alcohol . He’s in his 50s. My grandma , his mom, has bad Alzheimer’s that came on quickly and my grandpa mentioned genetics to me which is worrisome. I never thought my dad could have Alzheimer’s as the cause of his memory .
I saw an AMA here once with someone that age, and a followup.  Here's the followup, and it has a link to the original.  I hope it helps.        

https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/picow1/i_have_earlyonset_dementia_ama/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3tUt\_MMWLg&ab\_channel=AlzheimersResearchUK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3tUt_MMWLg&ab_channel=AlzheimersResearchUK)

[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18067401](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18067401)

That can help you get started.
It is likely a bad diagnosis unless this has been genetically confirmed and also confirmed via lumbar puncture or amyloid PET scan.  Nothing else would be acceptable to lead to a diagnosis at 26.

But 99.9999% of people in that age range actually have pseudo dementia.  Which can perfectly mimic dementia and fool inexperienced physicians.

I very highly recommend a second opinion with a reputable memory specialist neurologist and neuropsychologist.  Because chances are very high that that diagnosis is incorrect.
Early Onset AD has a direct genetic etiology and therefore I would suspect this is a doctor telling the patient they have the genes for it and may start to have cognitive decline somewhere around their 50s. Do you know if this person already has symptoms?",2022-04-16 22:17:27,razorbeamz,u5d46t
Alzheimers,Suspect that Mom has Alzheimer’s.. refusal to go to a doctor,"My mom is beginning to lose her short term memory. For the past couple of years, I would have to text her instructions or times/dates for things that I needed her to remember. Within the last 6 months, she will tell the same story 3 times within at hour if talking to a group of people. She doesn’t recall doing that. Her older sister passed away from
AD in her 50’s. My mom is in her early 70’s. 

My main concern right now is that she basically has a phobia of going to a doctor. She refuses to go. She hasn’t been examined by anyone in about 3 years. The only reason she went then is because she has asthma and needed a refill on her inhaler. 

She is out of prescriptions and is now getting some kind of over the counter inhaler, that I’m sure it not nearly as effective. We live in the south, and pollen has been really bad. She was boiling water and breathing over it because she couldn’t breathe yesterday and it wasn’t time to use the inhaler again.

I was so aggravated that she wouldn’t go see a doctor and get a prescription that would help her! Several family members have begged her to go and she refuses.. says she will go when she really needs to..

I need to get her checked out in general now that I feel that she may have AD. Does anyone have any tips on how to get their loved one to a doctor? Or has anyone experienced this “phobia”? I honestly think she is scared to go. My dad says she won’t even let him take her blood pressure at home.","You have to make the appointment.  Get them in the car and go.  Don’t even tell her.  When she realizes you are at the doc just say, oh sorry, I forgot I have a doctor appointment.  Go in and make sure you have talked to the doc in advance and he/she knows what’s up.  It will work out.  You can even slip the doc a note, just pretend you are going to the bathroom.  Been there, done that.
You can try to get a video appointment with a doctor that does telemedicine. For a lot of stubborn patients sadly they end up not seeing any doctor until they fall and have an injury that lands them in the ER and/or surgery. Then end up in a nursing home directly from hospital and rehab
Good luck, please get a health care power of attorney and financial power of attorney and health care directive ASAP. 

I have a similar situation, was able to get my dad to the doctor for a cortisone shot to the knee last month. His physical is in two weeks, but he hasn't been to his doctor since 2019 when we got the official dementia/Alzheimer diagnosis, he also gets angry when a DR appointment is mentioned.
When i used to work at a doctor office, there were rare cases that the doctors did a home visit. Maybe you can ask the doctor if this is a possibility?  

Also looks like this is fairly advanced case, take care.
Call the county and have them do a vulnerable adult check. They can then give her choices where going to the doctor would seem favorable to her than other options they could offer.",2022-04-16 10:11:22,Potential_Yellow_104,u4ymzd

I finish up with today’s Wordle.  I’m usually afforded the time to do these as my wife does a jigsaw puzzle or colors in a coloring book just after breakfast.

I find these engage my conscious thought, giving me a half-hour to hour “vacation” from caregiving.  If I take this time, I return to caregiving with renewed optimism and energy.",2022-04-16 00:57:18,davidb43ni,u4qdow
Alzheimers,Help me help my partner.. please!,"Hi, I’ve just joined this group as 2 days ago, my partners mum was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s following a brain scan. He is a neuro physiotherapist so he works with people with dementia so he has some experience of helping people in his mums situation. I however, am going in blind. How do we help her? We are 2.5 hours away from where she lives so I’m not sure what we can do. My partner works Monday-Friday and some weekends and we have 2 children and are therefore unable to pop up there all the time. How can we help from a distance?

Also, side note -  I lost my mum to cancer in February of this year and supporting my partner is bringing up a lot of emotion that I dealt with during my mums diagnosis. I’m struggling to help my partner when I’m going through grief myself? I’d be interested in hearing how you have been supported by partners/support your partners, thanks!","You should get a durable power of attorney setup now.  The forms are available online.  You should not need a lawyer for this.  The Alzheimer's patient and your partner will need to sign the forms in front of a notary.  Work with the patients medical provider to get an advanced healthcare directive setup.  Conversations should be held ASAP if they are still cognizant about their finances.  Your partner will need to know and take over handling any financial issues which arise.  If assisted living or memory care is in order there are people who can help to place them in a facility.  Often these people take a cut of the move-in fee and will not bill you for their services.  You 2 will need to decide if relocating them to be local to you is appropriate.  If it's time to take the car away relocation will be easier.
I am so sorry you're being hit with a double whammy. Big hugs. 

Many people on this & related subs recommend the book *The 36-Hour Day* and YouTube videos by Teepa Snow. These may not supply you a checklist for how to manage dementia from a distance, but will help you understand the disease and how to cope, what to expect. 

The Alzheimer's Association has a 24 hour hotline, https://www.alz.org/, 800.272.3900 where you can ask, vent, seek resources, like IRL or online support groups.

If your mom was associated with a hospital or hospice, they should also have information on support groups to which they can refer you.

Your ""area council on aging"" (search for that online + the name of your or your MIL's city, county or state) may have additional resources, including practical (eg, not only about your own headspace) resources for care. 

Your use of ""mum"" suggests you may not be in the US. My ideas are based on US experience, but I'm sure many other countries have similar resources. If that's the case, perhaps others checking in here may have other location-specific info.

You might also consider joining some other subs: r/dementia, r/caregivers, r/CaregiverSupport , r/eldercare.",2022-04-16 06:00:34,lifewithlaurenx,u4ul6o
Alzheimers,Abusive Grandmother,"Hey guys!

I'm just looking for people to talk to about my family's situation and I don't know really know what resources to look out for. 

About three weeks ago my grandpa passed away suddenly from covid and we recently have taken primary care of my grandmother. She has recently been diagnosed with stage one Alzheimers and my family is deteriorating because of her. She mentally and verbally abuses my mom, accuses my teenage brother of stealing, and calls my dad a murderer and a rapist. Recently she has become physical by pushing around my mom, throwing furniture and we've had to start hiding our knives. My family is struggling and we have to find other housing options for her, but everything is way too expensive, and she doesn't qualify for medicare. Do yall have any pointers and any advice for me so I can help my family? I'm currently away at college and come home every two weeks or so.","Medicare would not pay for a nursing home anyway. Medicaid is the one that does. When you say she does not qualify, what do you mean? A lot of people misunderstand the two and misunderstand community Medicaid versus long term care Medicaid.
Start here to see what government programs exist she might be eligible for (US):  https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/resources/locator_tool

*The 36 hour day* is a book for advice on dementia and how to handle patients. often referred on here.
Hey there! First - sorry you and your family are going through that. I can honestly say I know exactly what you mean bc my situation is the same except I am the mom. I also have a daughter finishing college who is hugely affected by her grandmothers behaviour. We all live together and my daughter has been studying at home bc of covid. 

I know with my mom she/we have an appointment w her doctor after Easter to discuss adjusting her medication. She was prescribed meds for depression about 6 mnths ago but just tonight my sister and I agreed I need to hide the knives, scissors, safety pins. The depression swings into aggression quickly and without warning now. Again, my hope is that perhaps a new medication or adjustment of a current one will help her chill out. Fingers crossed and hang in there! Good on you for reaching out and keep up the great work with school!
In the States, connect with an Aging and Disability Resource Center or Agency on Aging in your area.  That's an excellent starting point.  They can help you with not only locating the right residential placement, but also figuring out how to get it paid for.

Alzheimers,Portal available!,"Hi all,

I bought my parents a Facebook Portal that they used for about a year. Now it sits unplugged on a dresser. I’d like to pass it on to a family that could use it. It’s in perfect condition and I assume it can be reset to factory settings. 

It’s a pretty cool device and helps you connect with loved ones via video when you can’t be there physically all the time. 

Please let me know if anyone would like me to ship this to them—just asking for shipping costs.","Awww! No thank you for me, not needed. But this is such a thoughtful, kind thing to do!
Hi, I have been thinking of getting a device like that. Are you able to leave it on at all times? My loved one would not be able to figure out how to turn it on. But I would love to be available for her to just say my name and I would be connected to her.
Edit. I’d love for her to say my name but she forgot it. I would be interested if you think it would work for us.",2022-04-15 19:36:19,jane_doe4real,u4kthy

Alzheimers,Need a little help,"My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimers two years ago. It is really sad seeing her slowly degrade mentally, even though she still recognize everyone in her family. This is a pretty new situation for me, can anyone give me some advice how to support her and my grandfather who is there for her. It’s a rough time for both of them no doubt. Just two years ago the three of us traveled to Germany and now she doesn’t remember the names of her neighbours and favorite authors. It’s such a strange feeling mourning the inevitable while she’s still here and I notice that I keep thinking of her at least once a day.
Thanks.","Be patient. Don’t get upset when she repeats herself. Support her when she’s frustrated because she can’t remember things. Hug her when she cries. My mother is experiencing this for the past 7 years. Yes it’s sad watching someone who once was independent become dependent. You can post little stickies around the house. I bought my mother a click from Amazon to help her with the time, date and months. It also helps her differentiate between day and night. It’s an Alzheimer’s clock. She if you can get her to go to Senior programs. Try to be ritualistic. Do the same things to give them a routine. Don’t change things around them because they are forgetful. You may have to get Home health services to help out at home. It’ll be hard having a stranger come in but any help is necessary. Take time for yourself and take care of yourself as well. Care givers get burnt out. This disease is progressive. Remember patience and love is the key. Many blessings to you and your family.
Try to keep her socially engaged and stimulated as long as possible. If she doesn’t know or remember something, just give her the answer in a way that lets her save face, and move on or change topic, don’t tell her she’s wrong. She may not know her neighbors today but I bet she can tell you stories from her childhood. She can still experience strong feelings in the moment both bad and good. She may not remember her favorite writers but may still enjoy hearing their work like new. 

If she doesn’t recognize you, she may still know her grandkids (who may be young in her mind) and you can ask her to tell you about them in third person. Focus on what she CAN do. 

Record her when she’s telling stories on her good days. Try to enjoy the good moments, or at least what she is still able to do.

Try to do research to alleviate some burden on grandfather. Research on social programs, adult day activities, government programs she might qualify for. It’s hard to do that long-term research while also actively managing a crisis. Make sure all the ducks are in a row, legally speaking (Power of attorney, will, medical directives, HIPAA permissions etc) “in case she gets hit by a bus”. 

Don’t tell her she has Alzheimer’s or dementia unless she asks you why she can’t remember things etc. Oftentimes patients do not remember forgetting stuff, so when people tell them they have dementia it validates the paranoia and they can believe they are being gaslighted.

if she has hearing loss, she needs to get hearing aids and actually use them. Unaddressed hearing loss accelerates dementia as it becomes hard to hold a conversation with details and nuances.  It is also important to try to prevent falling. Remove stuff from the stuff, extra furniture that is difficult to navigate around. 

She might become mean and stubborn. Especially in the late afternoon, evening, middle of the night. this is called Sundowning. I always found it useless when people said “don’t argue and don’t try to reason with them”. Imo more useful is to change topic, Redirect their attention, or make up reasons to postpone the issue. 

If she gets dramatically worse or even crazy within a short time, get her screened for UTI. 

Get in-home help if she gets combative especially about hygiene. You and grandfather may find she is actually nicer to the aide helping her bathe instead of family. 

It is a neurodegenerative disease.  when she gets worse, it does NOT mean anyone did something wrong. If some strategy stops working, it’s not a failure; it did its job buying you some decent time. There is no cure. The goal here is her quality of life.",2022-04-15 19:57:54,C_A_N_G,u4l7p6
Alzheimers,Just a story and rant,"I was trying to just understand how my wife (69 yrs old diagnosed with Dementia about 3 years ago) thinks, like her thought process. 

I completely understand that her short term memory is horrible but was wondering if she is just living in the moment or she thinks things thru. If you met her you might think she is a little off center but still ok (I hope that makes sense).

I then ask her if she could explain to me how she thinks about doing tasks and I then go on to explain how my thought process works, an example being:

I’m going to play Pickleball so I:

Get Dressed, Grab my stuff, walk to car, start car, drive to court, play, etc……..

I then asked her what her thought process was like, and she already forgot what the question was! 

At that point what is there to really say other then I guess I now have the answer. 

I really just hate the my wife is going thru this and I’m losing my partner.","It might also be helpful to read about executive function (and dysfunction). One of the first things to go in dementia is executive function. Something that has helped my mom is having a list of steps she can follow (such as for making coffee), which allows her to feel like she can still do some things independently.
From what I've seen with my partner, ""thought process"" may be too abstract. And from what I've been reading, and to some extent have seen, the notion of a sequence may be problematic. That is, you have to do one thing, which prepares you for a second thing, and the two of those lead to a third thing and so on.

The individual steps may be known, but that one element builds on others is lost, or the order in which they occur gets jumbled, with some steps omitted. Because really, who actually thinks consciously about the steps to, say, brushing your teeth? 

Pick up toothbrush. Pick up toothpaste. Unscrew toothpaste, left to loosen. Squeeze tube. Hold tube to brush. Swipe paste on brush. Transfer brush to other hand, hold alongside tube. Pick up tube cap with now-free hand. Place cap above tube. Align. Screw right, or with hand holding tube screw left… etc.

It's frustrating as hell, too, because you look down and see a blob of toothpaste smeared along the sink and the toothbrush in the toilet, and you're pretty sure you messed up, but how? And what will the consequences be? But the color of the toothpaste is so ugly, was I really going to put that in my mouth?

We're not there yet, but seems like where we're headed. Maybe it helps that we both have some experience with recreational drugs back in the day. It's like going grocery shopping with someone in tow who's smoked a whole bunch of weed. And wandering into the bakery aisle, when you just stopped in to pick up cat litter. 

At least, that's my take on it.
I'm so sorry.  Stay strong!  Vent here all you want.  PM me if you ever want.  My mom has had dementia for 5-6 years (probably longer)
My husband has vascular dementia. He rants and raves and says the most vile things to me. When it is over, he can’t remember what he said.   It takes a toll on the marriage.
I definitely relate it to babysitting someone on a moderate amount of LSD. My mother is at the ""constant severe senior moment"" stage where we have conversations like

""Where are you going?""
""Sam's club like you asked, mom.""
""No it can't be, Sam's club is in Springdale""
(The club in the next town over, which has been closed for 20 years)
""It's been here for a while now, this is where you always go.""
""Noooo."" (Disbelieving and dismissive no in joking tone of voice.)
(Refusing to argue, leading the way into Sam's club.)
""Oh wait, I DO remember this new place now that I'm inside. They all look the same don't they""

Alzheimers,Grandma lost her smartphone,"Hey guys, so I grandmother lost her smartphone and now she won't keep bothering everyone about where it is. Although, I know that if we give her a new phone she will not like it. How should I handle this?","Tell her she lost it.  This being Alzheimer's, you'll have to repeat that answer often because she'll likely ask it repeatedly.

A smart phone is too smart for an Alzheimer's sufferer; hell, mine is even too smart for me, and I'm the caregiver.  

Not willing to shell out another $800 for another smartphone doomed to be lost soon, I got DH a low-end model for about $150.  He could never figure out how to use it.  So I got him a flip phone (about $30) - same story.  Then I got him an old fashioned land line.  He couldn't figure that out either, and took it apart.  Now if he wants to make a call, I dial my phone and hand it to him.
Maybe a phone without service? Someone’s old phone they aren’t using any more? Then she could use it in the Wi-Fi, but have the calling turned off.
Can you get the same phone as before? Or something very similar?

We've decided we'll only be getting dad mid/low range Samsungs due to his familiarity and their phone finding abilities are a bit more advanced than the usual.
Several years ago I went to a cell phone store with my children. They gave my kids some of the old former display phones as toys. I don’t know if they still have this or will do this but it might be an option (although obviously the phone wouldn’t work, but that is probably not a bad thing).
There's not really a good answer, is there? I agree with all the posts. However I want to add my experience. 

My LO used her phone for a long time. We ended up getting a low end smart phone and putting a bunch of user-locks on it. I think at the end we just took the SIM card out. She enjoyed scrolling through Facebook and downloading games from the various ads she saw (I think she thought she was playing the ads.) 

She was pretty protective of the phone. It was her last corner of privacy (even though we checked it so often). It made her feel connected to the family and friends she knew around the country. It gave her a way to escape - just like it does for all of us. 

We went through an... event that transition her from mid to late stage.  She forgot all about the phone. Now adays she'll occasionally pick up or try to touch the screen of a phone that's laying about. I think she knows what it is... Or something. 

All this to say - balancing quality of life for your LO, yourself, and your pocketbook is tough. Best of luck.
It's likely she'll keep bothering everyone about the phone one way or another, so the choice is what. My inclination would be to go with ""It broke. It's at the repair shop"" because that's not a mystery in the same way, and it can just be permanently at the repair shop without ever coming back.
The best way to handle useless questions (my mom has a lot of them) is to distract.

For example: 

Where is dad? “I don’t know, oh say would you like a cold drink?” Stick to the here and now.
tell her the phone went for repair.
Do you have an old phone you can give her? I don't think she'll notice if it doesn't have service",2022-04-14 19:54:39,peanuthorse,u3uvl1

Alzheimers,"Tips on how the handle the ""I want to go home"" even though we are at home.","Father 83 years old I'm sole caretaker, doing it for 7 years now up's downs you know the gist im ""used"" to it. but for the past year or so like clockwork around 8pm he wants to go home and it takes around an hour or more to make him ""stop"" and be content and stay. man it's so taxing. 

I mean he has incontinence bowel and urinary so I take care of that, and all the other stuff that comes with the territory no problem but this constant ""goin home"" gets me..","We have several different techniques that work with my dad:

The obvious one I take him home, we are lucky that we can leave town drive a short distance and reenter town on a different road.

When he says home he means bed (especially at night) so mum takes him up to their room and he settles. 

He wants to go home to his wife, my sister rings to distract whilst my mum changes her sweater and reenters the house, ie. she comes home.

A dog walk around the block, again exiting their estate on one road and reentering on a different road to break the cycle.

Obviously some of these won't fit your situation but please ask any questions and I will try my best to help.
Sometimes it means they want to go back to when they weren't sick.
My dad would often ask to go ""home"" when we were home and we learned over time it was probably likely he was feeling extra confused and insecure. I'd grab his hand or hug him (to reassure him) and say something like ""Ok, we'll head home after we x (insert activity here)"". Usually that would help. Good luck, OP.
It’s sundowning. My grandmother always wants to start the I don’t know why they brought me here conversation. No one but herself brought her to where we live. She’s confused, I try and get her to focus on what she has here. Do I take good care of you, do you want to have a stay with one of your daughters, do you want to just go somewhere for awhile. Usually she veers back off topic with the questions I’m asking her and forgets the original complaint. It doesn’t make it any less irritating, but it calms her down when I give her the options.
My mom does the same thing, but she is already bedridden. I will just say ""we're here,"" and mention the name of community we live in, but in our case it's the same house for 50 years, but sometimes she still mentions Europe where she grew up and asks for her mom who also passed 45 years ago. You might have to say something and reference the name of community he is talking about if it's not the home you are at now. You can try to change the subject and bring up an old story related to that property. There is no correct answer with any of that though.
Sometimes turning on some music can instantly change their mood. It's like a switch in atmosphere, and most patients with Alzheimer's respond pleasurably to music; it's an area of the brain that remains functional longer than others. It helps distract them and change their focus from ""Home"" to the music.

I like u/kitkatinkerbell's suggestions and have used some of the same techniques when helping my SIL care for my brother, especially ""taking him home"" by getting in the car, riding several miles and returning, saying ""We're home!""

In his mind, ""Home"" might be a childhood home or a home from early adulthood, so there's no way to grant his wish or to even figure out what he's talking about -- this is why distraction and/or humoring him works better than correcting him. 

I admire you so much for caring for your dad! That's such a loving, caring way to honor your father. ...In the day- to-day struggle, I know how much of a strain it can be, how much stress and fatigue you must be feeling. I hope you're finding support with other caregivers who understand your challenges, and I hope you have family or others who can offer relief for you so you can get the rest you need. Bless you!
Hi! Cheers to all the hard work you have done to take care of him! 

Since it is always happening at the same time, it may be from a long forgotten routine from years back.  He is basically not living in the present when this is happening.  Try to engage and ask if there is someone they want to see at home, or is there something they need to do? Or if they just want to be at home. 
It could be they are wanting to reminisce about a memory or talk about someone. 

It may be physical, sensory ,(is it too loud, too quiet?)or emotional need, but he's not able to express it properly. That's where detective skills come in handy.

Alzheimers,Apple air tags?,"FIL is in AL but not memory care, so he can come and go.  I’m not worried about him getting lost because he’s not that progressed and his AL is in a part of town where he’s lived for 40 years (long term memory is still good).  I am worried that he’ll over do it and not be able to make it back home and get stranded.

He wears a medical alert necklace 24/7 but it doesn’t have a GPS locate so I was thinking about adding an air tag with the kind of water resistant cover you use for dog tags.

Thoughts?","Now is the time to start prevention measures so that he does not get lost. Often seniors that go missing are in early stages. This is when they are most ambulatory and can easily get confused. Just last week a lady where I live was still driving and went missing. She was in the early stages and her family was still letting her drive. No sign of her yet.

He does not need to be left alone or allowed to drive. My mom thought it was ok to let my dad drive shortly after he was diagnosed and he went the wrong way down a street. No traffic, thankfully, but he could have hurt himself or someone else. I put my foot down and said no more driving.
My mother's assisted living facility had a system just for this phase of dementia.  She wore a bracelet that triggered an alarm if she attempted to through any of the exterior doors.  Of course, it was an added option that I begrudgingly paid, but it worked quite well.  My mother could do anything she liked within the facility (including interior courtyards) but had to have an escort if she left the building. I'm actually surprised your facility is allowing someone with alzheimer's (albeit in the early phases) to be in assisted living without some sort of safeguard.

I tried airtags with my kids.  It's ok but doesn't give you minute-by-minute updates.  It works great if they go to a friend's house after school, but near useless at an amusement park as it doesn't update frequently enough.  If your FIL got lost, the airtag may tell you where he was 1 minute ago or 30 minutes ago.  That may be good enough though, up to you.  Chipolo makes a very thin airtag compatible device, you could slip it into his wallet.
I am in a similar situation. I use find my friends on my mom’s phone to track her. You can add alerts for when they leave certain places, are not at certain places etc. Of course only works if they have their phone on them. I also track her vehicle’s GPS. We considered the air tag but being an apple user myself, id have to swap between her Apple ID and mine to see it which would get difficult. Tile is another one you can use, but it does emit a sound when trying to track which could be startling. There’s a lot of ways to track and drawbacks to each. As long as you find one that’s reliable and works for you, all the better. Keeping them safe is top priority.
I guess he doesn't take a mobile phone around with him? If so there are apps like Life360 that will give you tracking at all times. 

I haven't used Apple Air Tags but have heard stories about how they helped people retrieve their stolen bikes pretty well so its worth investigating.

How could you guarantee he always had it with him? Sew it in his jacket somehow?

Check out these little Spark Nano GPS Trackers.  They are super inexpensive.  My sis got them for her teen's car a while back and really liked it.  We'll most likely be getting one for Mom soon-ish.
I have an airTag for my hubby. (About stage 5-6) I have an IPhone as does our three children. The AirTag  is assigned to my iPhone and shows up on the Apple Find My ap under the “Items” tab.  I have activated the “Share My Location” option on my phone with each of my kids. They can see where my hubby and I are. This is a safety support for both of us. I put the AirTag inside hubs wallet as he always puts his wallet in his pants and I secured in place with double sided tape. He doesn’t notice it’s there. This has worked well for us.",2022-04-13 13:58:55,CK1277,u2wa1l
Alzheimers,how do I get my dad to stop spending the money that's supposed to pay the mortgage?,"He'll take money out, then forget that he took money out and then take more out. (You shouldn't even be driving himself to the bank where the ATM. We do the best weekend to stop him but it's not easy to keep track of him 24/7)

He gets a state issue disability check every month. And our mortgage payments are set to automatically withdraw from his account.

But he's reckless with money. Always has been. Even before he lost his mind. He doesn't understand how money works. He just keeps taking and taking. Takes out 400 to 600 a month to buy pot. (We still can't even figure out when and how he's getting it.)

In the comments section of a different post someone suggested contacting social services about having his check split between him and someone else. Someone else to manage his money. They wouldn't do it. It was a confusing conversation. Something about how his bank has an overdraft thing. So he can take more money out than he has. Which puts him in the negative. Which means social services can't give him a certain amount of money knowing that it's only going to pay off the negative balance and then he won't have any left.

I hope I'm explaining this right. I hope I'm making sense. We were trying to ask them to put $400 into his account as an allowance. And then put the rest of it into my mother's account. But because his account's always in the negative, they wouldn't do it.

My parents have separate bank accounts. So no one else has access to his account.

Could we ask the bank to cancel the overdraft service? I know typically no one else can make changes to a bank account without the account holder there. But if we explain the medical situation, and we're not asking to take any money from him. Would they do it? Or if we had some kind of doctor's note explaining he's incompetent, could we then take that to the bank and put my mom's name on his account as well?

We've tried to just take his wallet or bank card from him for a few days. We've tried to just prevent him from taking cash out until the mortgage is withdrawn. But he flies into fits of rage when he thinks he's being handled and treated like a child.

Sorry if this is long and rambling. Any suggestions though?","The various things you want to do would require him giving you durable POA (legal, business things).  I take it you haven't had that discussion yet?  What is your mom's role here?  

If your dad has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, he shouldn't be driving.  Why?  Well if he is involved in any accident, any at all, even if not at fault, the lawyers will request medical records, find he is impaired, then he can be sued for every penny, not sure car insurance will even cover him.  

It would be good if somehow the topic of diminishing capacity could be broached, or you have many large fights ahead of you.
Cut up his cards with scissors, take his tires off and roll them to a friend's house. Seriously, he could kill someone driving. Get serious.
My dad used to do something similar. He was taking out cash every week because he only understood cash as really money any more.

At one point the bank wouldn't even let him take out as much as he wanted. Not sure if they were really allowed to do that... but they were aware of his issues. His car got taken away soon after that so I would have to take him to the bank.

Does he have a POA or anything in place? If not do it now while he's still somewhat with it. 

If you don't have a POA you will need him present with you or your mother to get someone added to his account because they need his consent. If he's still with it enough, you may have to make up a white lie to make him okay with why someone is being added. 

 I used to have to drag my dad to the bank because he has a trust which makes everything a pain. He would just sit there and smile while I did everything for him. The bank was aware of the situation and was pretty nice about it. I think they're used to elderly customers having issues and in the end if it's a good bank they want to do what is best for their customer.
You need power of attorney and to prevent him from getting to the assets in the first place. Absolutely file for that ASAP. Explain the situations to his doctors - they may not realize he’s as far gone as he is. You may also need to switch doctors and see someone who can properly evaluate him, because that is exactly why power of attorney was invented. To address situations like this.
Absence an incompetence hearing, and judgment, you need his signature for POA. You're going to have to explain that to him and start putting that in his ear. You get it set up first, and then take him to the lawyer or whoever can do it for you, in our case, it was the bank. Then, you just take him and have the agent explain to him that his signature is for his benefit and have him sign.

I would not take his pot from him. I don't know where you live, but cannabis is one of the most beneficial treatments for Alzheimer's patients. Far better and safer than anti-psychotic drugs. Unfortunately, when it comes time for a care facility, that will not be available to him.

That's my opinion and my experience.

Alzheimers,Caregiver support group -starting in 2 weeks (Florida),"I might have posted this company before because they're doing a lot of work for caregivers especially in Florida. Now they have an online group program with a therapist that takes Medicare and PPOs that's just for caregivers. It's starting in 2 weeks all online. I called them to enroll (I have Cigna), and I'm excited to start soon. I think they may take other states now I forgot to ask but I wanted to share it with you all to help you find some extra support if you need it.

The lady I spoke to was really nice.

Alzheimers,Correcting a person with dementia,"Short version (I can add info if needed), my FIL is stage 4 dementia.  He was living with a roommate with lots of family help (not doing well, but good enough) and then COVID happened.  Roommate almost died and is still recovering.  Family member who was helping lost her husband.

I am the legal guardian and I made arrangements for FIL to go into assisted living.  He can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it).

Even before Alzheimer’s, he was a negative and bitter person.  He has alienated most of his family.  I am stepping up as a humanitarian move.

He initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind.  The problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available.

The reasons he gives for wanting to leave AL are not grounded in reality.  He thinks they’re stealing from him (items he hasn’t owned in years), they’re withholding eye drops (that are literally in his medicine cabinet) and they’ve intercepted his calls so he’s not getting the job offers that are coming in.

He’s not progressed enough for memory care, but AL is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will.

I keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there I don’t know what to do with him.","You can't argue with them you have to trick them. See if you can visit the place a few times and tell him he lives there and you will be back to move his things there.
Maybe you and the AL social worker could sit down with him and go over all his concerns.  

Additionally, you need to remind him it's not as simple as going back to his old house, because it's rented out to someone else, and the roommate/caregiver is no longer available to help him with day to day affairs.

Explore options - maybe he would prefer a different AL placement?  Scope out what would happen if he did check out, where would he go?  (repeating that his house is being rented out to another party and thus is not available).

You and the social worker can also go over some of his deluded beliefs (don't call them that in front of him!).  Show him where the eye drops are, and ask if he'd like someone to administer them to him.  Point out that he is not really eligible to go back to employment.  Items he views as stolen, you happen to know he has not owned for years. 

My DH who I am trying to put into memory care at present, has had similar delusions.  He wants to go back into the military (age 81!) and when he has lost a wallet by leaving it somewhere, he states that someone ""stole"" it.  He can't locate most of the things he needs (constantly losing toothbrushes).  It's partly a matter of ""hearing"" what he is saying but then reframing.

Good of you to look out for this man.  Hope you can work things out.
My dad is in memory care and went through a similarly tough patch where he was paranoid, angry, argumentative, and distrustful. He worried about people taking his car and money (this included my mom, who he said his lawyer would be contacted, because she needed to get out of his house.)

This passed after time, but it was a tough roughly 2 years. Eventually, he just remembered less and less and became easier to fool into believing the lies that helped him feel comforted.

Telling the truth often has no benefit -- it upsets them in the short term, and in the long term, they don't remember the truth and are upset about the same thing all over again. Keep your FIL a little more comfortable by finding lies that will calm him down.
Lie, lie, lie.  Say, ""This is only temporary"".  Or, ""If it doesn't work out, we'll move you back"".  I'm constantly saying this to my mother during every conversation I have with her and she's been in memory care for almost a year.  Now that she is settled (she still isn't happy about it), she fears change and when I bring up finding a new facility for her, the thought of changing her routine scares her and she stops complaining (for a little while)

I was staunchly against medicating my mother for behavioral reasons because I didn't want to lose what little was left of her inside.  But, it really is what's best for them.  Imagine being scared every day of your life, not knowing where you are or what's happening around you?  Even Tom Hanks would get ornery and lash out at people.  Move him, medicate him
One thing I did with my dad is tell him we found him “an apartment with help” that was just a home base for him. At first he liked it, and then he hated it, one day telling me he was never going back. I drove back there with him in my car, and when he saw the building, he said, “That’s a BAD place.” I parked and he asked, “What are we doing here?” I said, “I need to speak to the lady at the front desk.” “Should I stay in the car?” “No, come with me, I said.” He came with me, I checked us both in, walked him to his room, and we said goodbye like everything was fine.

Do what you can to get through the moment. 

Also, if he’s paranoid he may not want to take additional medications, but if he’s already taking medications, you could speak to his doctor about adding something for his mood (assuming you have medical POA?). That has helped my dad. 

It’s so tough. Good luck! 💐
I wish I could help you with advice, but I can say that trying to correct doesn't work. My MIL has a similar delusion about ""them"" trying to steal her house from her, or that the sewer pipe under the house is broken so she won't use her bathroom, etc. My husband and SIL try to logic her out of these delusions with evidence. At best, she will stop arguing about it and sulk. She refuses to discuss assisted living and lives in the same town as SIL. They check on her a few times a week, and my husband will stay with her 2-4 weeks at a time. (We are in another state) The other 2 siblings are no help. (She was also not the nicest person in younger years so they see her 1-2 times a year out of duty.)
If he is a danger to himself, you can gain power of attorney and guardianship.  That will likely give him little choice.  He'll hate you for it.  However, once dementia has progressed enough, he won't remember that he hates you.
My grandmother had moved AL twice and both times she has gone through a phase of this when she first moved in. It went on months the first time, but she had progressed by the second move and it lasted a few weeks.",2022-04-12 09:14:55,CK1277,u1yu78
Alzheimers,How to help wandering,Is there any want to stop/help a grandparent from leaving the house especially at night? I think they’ve tried locks but she figures it out.,"We bought some of those toddler door handle safety covers and that really did the trick. We also put those cheap slide locks at the base of the door and dad never noticed it to open the door. We just slid them open with our toe. 

We had those cheap alarms on the doors but the rest of us would always forget about them and scare the crap out of ourselves when we went out the door. Lol. So those didn't last long.

Dad wasnt too bad about wandering at night but there was a short time he would get up. So, we put a string of bells on the door and knew that we would hear them if he opened the door.
Double keyed deadbolt.
depending how far along your grandparent is, you may try one of those door decals that makes it look like a bookcase or something. Also, an alarm on the door is wise.
My FIL installed double-keyed deadbolt locks and always keeps the keys hidden.
Door alarms - not terribly expensive and they wake you or an overnight attendant who can then intervene;",2022-04-11 20:00:16,_roses__,u1lfz2
Alzheimers,Alzheimer’s and unresponsiveness,"Hello,

I’m not sure if any one can help me or steer me in the right direction but just looking for some help. My grandfather has Alzheimer’s (or possibly dementia) and is in full care by my grandmother (who admittedly is not the best with pushing for better medical care or testing from doctors). This morning he had an episode where he was laying down in bed, seemingly awake (eyes open and moving) but unresponsive to her calling him, touching him, etc. She called the paramedics and when they entered the room he “woke up” or became responsive again and was understandably agitated with them for being in his space. They took vitals and said that he was all good in that are and my grandfather refused to go to the hospital so they didn’t push it and left. 

My grandmother took him to his regular doctor today and said that it was just another stage of his decline. I am still concerned that it could be something else because I have never heard of it. I am the first point of contact for them but I am living out of state and trying to do my best from afar. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Or can provide any more insight on what I should be doing next time I am there?","It could be a stroke or a petit mal seizure, or it could just be your grandfather didn't feel like dealing with your grandmother for a spell.
My mom had a few episodes like this before we knew she had actual Alzheimer’s. I actually think they co tributes to quicker cognitive decline, but the doctors always tested for stroke and other things and said they couldn’t find anything. I do believe it is a form of stroke, maybe medicine just hasn’t caught up with it yet.",2022-04-11 16:23:11,sisroxtexas,u1gle4
Alzheimers,Can't Walk After Hospital Stay,"My dad has been in memory care for a couple of months now. Recently he had backpain and wouldn't leave his chair. So they sent him to the hospital to be checked on. They didn't find a source of the backpain (which seemed to go away on its own) but they did find blood clots in the lungs (blood thinners prescribed) and he was dehydrated so they pumped him with liquid. He was in bed for 3 or so days.

When I came to pick him up from the hospital he couldn't walk. I was really annoyed that the hospital wasn't helpful in that regard, but I chalked it up to his feet being swollen from the fluids. With a LOT of effort we finally managed to get him in the car, and back to the home. 

So I called today to see how he's doing and they said not great and that he's not walking on his own. Apparently they can get him upright with assistance but he can't walk. Sounds like he'll yell in pain when they manhandle him as well. 

The memory care doctor will be seeing him tomorrow so I know I just need to sit tight and not Karen until then, but I'm just so frustrated. He could walk just fine before hand. Dr. Google is telling me older people lose that function a lot faster after bed rest, but it just blows my mind.","It’s not uncommon for this to happen after a hospital visit, but it’s dependent on a lot of factors. Previous conditions obviously contribute but it could just be the new phase he is entering. Or could it pass in the following week, as this happens too. The doctor should be able to determine what’s going on. 

I know edema causes a lot of issues with this population’s mobility, but exercise and compression socks can help fix that; a PT or OT could be suggested as well. I’d say wait to hear what the doctors says. 

Keep us posted.
Well whatever caused his back pain was presumably still troubling him, as it wasn't really addressed in the hospital, and walking or even standing may have been too painful for him.

Look into massage.  It helps my husband with his arthritic spine.  Medicare covers it under certain conditions, which includes chronic back pain.  Also, if your patient has been hospitalized for three days, Medicare covers 100% of a nursing home stay as long as discharged directly from hospital to nursing home.  (Check your insurance but we recently did this.)

If you can't swing that, maybe physical therapy.

Good luck.
I had a similar experience with my mom. Within a few days of moving into memory care she had several falls and then could no longer walk. It was such a rapid deterioration that I was completely shocked. That was right around new years and she has not walked since.
sorry to say this was the beginning of the end for my grandmother. She was never the same after she broke her hip. The muscles deteriorate fast and ingrained muscle memory that is not exercised for a couple days evaporates. Remember that Alzheimer’s attacks the brain’s ability to make conscious choices first. The decision of lifting your foot to step; planting it firmly, feeling confident enough on the first foot’s ability to bear weight 100% for a moment, that you lift the other… this is where she got frustrated and yelled. When she began to tip over, the reflexes of her leg kicked in and step quickly. But she couldn’t make the choice to do so. We tried asking her sweetly to let us help and she yelled and refused for hours. Eventually we had to just lift her into the chair and roll her back to the bed while she screamed bloody murder but then immediately fell asleep. It sucked",2022-04-11 16:30:54,Reichiroo,u1gs3o
Alzheimers,Caregiver struggles with early-onset,"Hey guys. My father-in-law is under 60 years old and was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. My mother-in-law had always said that she would like to put him in a secure safe assisted-living facility if/when he starts to get violent or too difficult to deal with. Well, now it is “well he didn’t mean to hit me, he thought I was the dog” or “he isn’t going to hit me. He’s just making those motions with his fists.”

Let me preface this by saying she has “read all the books“ and she even leads an Alzheimer’s support group. I know she knows what she’s doing but I think her judgment is clouded because it is her husband.

She is not admitting to her kids the full extent of what she has to deal with on a daily basis. She’s not in denial about the fact of the disease is progressive, and that eventually he will be beyond her capacity to help, but I don’t think she is ready to admit that he is far beyond that point. She wants to have kids and grandkids over but also does not want her husband to be upset and stressed and angry.

Her kids legitimately had to have a meeting with her to convince her to get help just two times a week with an outside service that can come and give her a break. 

The hardest part is that she has told me that she doesn’t want to put him in a home because it will make her feel guilty. I know it is hard for me to understand because it is not my husband, but it is so hard to watch her lose control of him and have to take care of him or take him for drives when she really wants to spend time with her children and grandchildren. 

Are we being insensitive in thinking that he is more than ready to be in a secure facility? How do we navigate the conversation that she no longer has the capabilities as one woman to care for a 6 foot 200 pound relatively healthy otherwise man with early onset Alzheimer’s?

Side note: The facility has an excellent reputation and we have family that works there.

Any guidance or suggestions would be appreciated.","There's a saying that by the time a family is ready to consider placing someone in assisted living what they need is memory care. It's really hard to admit how far someone has progressed.

For many people with dementia getting medication right can help a lot with agitation and violence, too, and it doesn't sound like there's a geriatric psychiatrist in the mix. It's definitely worth consulting one.

And on a practical note, is it clear that there's money for this facility? That may be a part of your MIL's reluctance that she's not voicing. A visit to a certified elder law attorney (even though he's under 65) would also be really important in figuring out how to preserve what she has if Medicaid is going to be involved, as it is for most people. In my state also facilities have to have a special license for people under 65, and those who have that license and also accept Medicaid patients are few in number. (Though those facilities may accept private-pay patients who will switch over to Medicaid when the money runs out--that's something that needs to be explicitly asked, and it's also worth asking whether there's a difference in services when they move to Medicaid (shared rooms are likely, for instance).
Has your MIL seen the facility you are considering? Does the facility have a social worker with whom she can speak and voice her concerns? Not a sales counselor but a real social worker. Has she discussed her situation with her support group? Is she worried about money or some issue other than guilt?  
  
I have a friend who was hospitalized after her husband with dementia assaulted her. Once the person with dementia becomes violent it is past time to make a change.
It IS my husband who has Alzheimer's, and I expect to have him enter a memory care facility in the next ten days.  I feel no guilt!  I can't handle the man.  He is not violent, but his constant wandering around the house getting into stuff and causing problems has me at my wits end.  He always told me ""I want to stay home, I don't want to go to an institution"" and I always answered ""I will keep you at home as long as I can, but the time may come when I can't do it any more.""  That time is now.  Actually an admissions coordinator asked when I would want him to move in and I said meekly, ""Yesterday?""
Having to make that call to move a loved one to a memory care or other secured facility is incredibly difficult even knowing it's the best thing for everyone when you get to that point. My mom struggled with it the most and wanted to talk to my dad about it. I discouraged it as it would only make my dad angry (he was too far long at this point) and wouldn't remember. What finally helped my mom realize was when I told her my concern was if something happened to her, his primary caregiver, we'd be forced to put him somewhere and rushed. If we decided as a family, we could research places and coordinate his move for it to go as smoothly as possible. 

We moved my dad in to memory care February 2021 and he passed in November. My mom broke her arm and needed surgery three weeks after we moved my dad in to memory care. I had to move in with my mom for the first few days as she could not do much on her own then her sister had to come stay with her after surgery. So, had we not made the decision, the decision would have been made for us when my mom broke her arm.
Mom and Dad are on the short end. Both were RNs for 25-30 years. Dad, the one with Alzheimer’s, has amazingly reduced mobility. (He had Polio in his teens, so he got off with a limp.) Mom is his caregiver until she makes up her mind. 

It’s a frustrating situation. Personal pride still reigns. You know, until Dad falls again…

I’ve volunteered to help out, but it is up to her to accept help of any kind.
So... he hits the dog? What?

If this were me, I would say I was stepping in. I would say gently that I would like to take over care decisions. It might come as a relief to her. If not, I would have a social worker come for an evaluation of both parties.",2022-04-11 15:39:03,jessfuh,u1fl6r
Alzheimers,Having a hard time,"Hi all,

Sorry in advance for this rant but it’s half two in the morning and I realized I just need to get things off my chest in order to sleep. I’ve been caring for a 92 year old family friend with Alzheimer’s for the past couple years. I (M22) live in the upstairs of her SoCal home and have been doing so for just over 10 years. My dad had to move here for work, but SoCal is very expensive. Thankfully she allowed us to rent her upstairs at an incredible price. My dad passed away in 2017 so I’ve been here alone with her for almost 5 years. Her Alzheimer’s is getting to be quite advanced e.g. - wandering, auditory hallucinations, not remembering close friends or photographs, not knowing where she is or where her parents are. She’s practically family to me now and I’m trying the best I can while also dealing with college. However recently I’ve been battling with some feelings that I’m not liking and am seeking some advice. I keep getting this awful feeling like I’m catching Alzheimer’s just by caring for her, being around her, or touching things she’s touched. This all started when I noticed some personal forgetfulness past the point of normalcy a couple months ago. I’m usually quite sharp/quick and this change kind of caught me off guard. It’s gotten to the point where over the past month I have been constantly second guessing my own memory and testing myself on minute details of my day to day activity. I know you can’t catch Alzheimer’s and I know those suffering from Alzheimer’s need just as much love and attention as we all do, but It’s like a horrible phobia that I can’t shake! I’ve been distant with her, and her daughter only comes to visit for a week or so every couple months. All she really has is me and a few friends who visit for an hour here and there once or twice a week. I just want to do what is right for her and care properly, but it’s impossible with whatever this is I’m experiencing. Thanks for reading and any advice would be much appreciated.","You definitely can’t “catch,” Alzheimer’s, but stress and depression can certainly cause you to be forgetful or have “brain fog” temporarily. I would have a real talk with her daughter about plans to keep her mom safe by bringing in a caregiver or moving her to a facility.
Oh, poor you - saying that in a sincere voice, not a mocking one.  I'm 67 and caring for my 81 year old husband who has Alzheimer's.  Since the early days of his diagnosis, I've wondered ""Is this contagious?  I feel like I'm losing MY mind!""

My support group reassures me that it's due to picking up all the cognitive load that is cast off by the patient in this picture.  In other words, you are doing a whole lot more than you think you are; with far fewer self care outlets such as friendships, parties, playing sports, dating, etc.

My latest stressor is my husband likes to wander around the house picking things up and putting them elsewhere.  He owns too many clothes and keeps taking something out of the closet, wearing it a while, then discarding it any old place.  He is teetering right at the border between middle stage and late stage, so he takes a lot of structuring, prodding, reminding, etc.  It is driving me NUTS.

I am hoping he can go to memory care within the month.  He really would be more appropriate there.  And I could use a little more of an empty nest.

Good luck to you.  One day your selfhood will return!
Stress, less sleep than usual, all things that can cause what you're feeling. For your sake and hers, I hope you have an idea of your future plans because if something happens, you may be homeless real quick. Try to make sure to get some time to yourself where you can rest, relax, etc. Best of luck op!
Oh gosh, sorry for losing yr dad, that's really hard.  And from such young age caring for an elderly Alzhms person on your own, wow super very tough, I don't know how you manage - what a legend!.  Seems you're developing a stress-induced issue?  Actually, most if not all sole carers do.   Depression, anxieties, insomnia, EDs, OCDs, other & all sorts of mental health issues carers develop.  So sorry eh, I feel for you, it's great you are aware & reaching out!  I guess, your memory issues are result of stress, and the worry about that, is tripping another stress reaction.   (Some similar things have happened to me a few times too, over the past years I've been caring for my mum, lost my whole life & all my friends & job to move countries back here to care for her.   It's hard.   Stresses & mental health issues flow around in waves, brain shuts down sometimes in protest  lol.  )   

 Not even trained well paid professionals can do this sort of thing alone for indeterminate years on and on, it's intense.  And unless the family are paying you an adequately substantial amount of money to help out, you need to have time to  be living your own life, right?   Ok you're getting a great deal on rent - but how much of your time and emotional & mental health are you losing?  Like I get the strong bond you have with kind old lady, and you want to be a good human, but you can't run yourself into the ground for other people and cheap rent. 

I think for a start you need respite time-off, for sure.  Some counselling, would also probably be helpful.  A proper talking with the daughter to get some other solutions organised.  And are you connected with carer support orgs?  So often, in the caring for someone else, the carer themselves are left by the wayside.  They endure & suffer being the main pillars of support, they also need aid & assistance to remain healthy happy & strong!   Alzheimers .org or Dementia .org can assist you with finding options & details for all those things.  They are experts in all aspects of memory-loss diseases & conditions, have tons of free resources, information, counselling, telephone helplines, etc etc.   Contact & speak with or visit yr area alzhms / dementia org asap!   They were life-savers for me, & my mum.  

 Of course it's the daughters responsibility to actually organise & arrange services / respite / in-home care / going residential / whatever for her mother, but who knows sometimes family members who live at a distance haven't really got around to finding out all that information - it might be helpful if you can at least get some printed literature / pamphlets / booklets whatever for her, to get things at least productively starting moving along somewhat.  And she needs to start organising some more help sooner, not later, not in 3 months 6 months time.  

It's great you're persevering with college, good on you!  I hope Alzhms org can help you out with lot of options & info.   Hang in there, best of luck to you!   Give an update some time, I'll be thinking of you!   \* hugs \*
I lived in a house with a very old woman that had dementia. I provided the evening meal and did some laundry until she had to go into a home. I was desperate for help and nobody understood. Even the health nurse didn't bother pressing her to see how far gone she really was. The thing was, she could small talk really well and this seemed to give everyone a completely false impression of how far she'd gone. I found out how woeful the system is for coping with things like this, even the professionals other than in the hospital. Because an ambulance came to pick her up one day when it got too much. Only a week before I told her GP that her mental deterioration need urgent attention and I stressed the urgent part. She did nothing. I feel for what you're going through, it's bitterly tough. I found a new level of misery living there.  I'm also sorry you lost your dad, I lost mine in 2016.",2022-04-11 06:17:47,covertcartographer,u14f8x
Alzheimers,"Just a rant, i guess…","Hey all. New member here. 
I guess I’ll give a quick background story; my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s back when i was in late grade school/early middle school. I was relied upon heavily as her caregiver (assisting my mom and a daytime aid we had most weekdays) and it was traumatic, to say the least. She was my best friend and it was just unreal to me that something could ravage a person like that. 
Now, my biggest fear is here. My mom was diagnosed officially last month, but i knew it had been coming for at least two years. The pandemic and some bad doctors really prolonged the diagnosis finally being on paper. 
I guess i y need to talk to other people who get it. My boyfriend, whom i live with, isn’t as supportive as i need. He lost his father last November and he keeps giving me shit for me talking about certain things regarding my mom in the past tense. He doesn’t understand that I’m in a grieving process. I do not speak about her like she’s dead, but i can’t call my mom for advice. Or to gossip. Or to joke about our weird family anymore. We can’t go shopping and try on clothes together anymore. It’s simple things. I feel that (he is a bit abusive but I’m looking for a way out of this, i wish we hadn’t moved in together, it’s so complicated right now for various reasons…) he almost tries to minimize my issues because my mom “is still here”. Some days he’s very loving and consoling but most he’s cold and is very critical of her doctors. He’s never met them, but he always makes sure to tell me every negative assumption he’s made. I finally have her with an excellent geriatric neuropsych, and he’s insisting that more could be done medication wise. I feel diminished. Like, you don’t think I’ve discussed these things to death with medical professionals?! 
Anyway, I’ve been in a dark depression for days now. It’s tough. I’m the only child and my dad is no spring chicken and i worry about how this will take a toll on him. 
But more than anything… i miss my mom. And my partner is not comforting about it. He has a slew of his own family issues which he expects me to always help with, and i do, but him insisting I’m wrong because i use past tense for certain things regarding my mother is irritating.  He doesn’t get that I’m grieving the fact that i can see my mom, but I’ll never get a text from her again. I’ll never be able to go to a Broadway show with her again or bake together at Christmas like we did every single year. It’a all so painful and I’m sick of how alone he makes me feel.  
Sorry for the rant. I’m just so deeply  drained physically mentally and emotionally and all i don’t know how much more of his crap i can take while i handle my mom’s needs. 
Sorry for the rant. I hate Alzheimer’s and i hate the lack of empathy among people. 
Thanks for reading, love and strength to you all 💜","I’m so sorry you’re dealing with such a double whammy of losing your mom and an unsupportive partner. I’ve tried to explain to my partner how many seemingly intangible things I’ve lost with my mother over the last few years (advice, consoling, shopping), and he doesn’t get it either. All I can say is get support where you can, from therapy and a caregiving/Alzheimer’s community.
Sorry you are going through this. Until someone cares or lives with someone with AD , I feel they just don’t get it. I believe men don’t understand the connection between a mom and daughter. My husband (75) has AD and although I was able to see my daughter , we haven’t been able do do any of the fun things we use to do together . it must be harder on you not having those mother / daughter talks and joking around. my best advice is to enjoy the time you do have and  maybe get some videos of her while you can . I don’t know where she is at with the disease but I believe  you will still have some good moments left. She will enjoy your hugs,  the sound of your voice, and the touch of your hands. Also a book that gets recommended that may help you. It’s called the 36 hour day your Dad may find it helpful as well. Best wishes to you and a big hug from a mom.

I am sorry you have to go through this and not get the support you need. You deserve better. You need to grieve in your own way and time. 

You said so much of what I felt when my mom went through the progression of alzheimers. I grieved the loss of the mom I knew for 72 years. I missed the long phone calls about nothing and everything. I missed calling her when I just needed my mom to comfort me and sympathize. I missed so much. 

Then I thought I was so prepared when she did pass away last month. I was wrong. I grieved for her when she was alive,but then when she was actually gone, I couldn't even hug her or kiss her cheek or stroke her hair. 

I know for myself I had to find some acceptance that I couldn't get the old Mom back, so I did my best to find ways to be with her. I played her favorite music, read her poetry, fed her chocolate, and sometimes just talked to her, not knowing if she even knew who or what I was talking about. Honestly, some times I really struggled to visit her,but I did usually feel better afterward, knowing I spent time with her.",2022-04-10 21:09:24,martian_glitter,u0vtng
Alzheimers,"My grandmother has had Alzheimer’s for a couple years now, and it finally crushed me this morning.","Growing up I didn’t get to see my Dads side grandmother a lot. She lived a state over, and so I only got to see her maybe once a summer and over a holiday, unless she drove to see us, and those weeks always went by way too fast. But that was in elementary and middle school. She sold that house and moved to Florida when I was in middle school. I saw her physically 1 time In high school for Christmas and I am now 2 years into college and haven’t been able to see her since then due to COVID and just flights/school. Over my time in high school she developed Alzheimer’s, and we only ever talk when I call her, and it’s dependent on her being at the phone or not having lost her phone. And I loved the talks we had. It wasn’t too bad, just repeating some questions, but she knew most things and what I was up to and what was going on. It slowly got worse, but I cherished the time I had. But then for like a 4 month period she didn’t pick up,  and finally she picked up again. And it was not the same. She was depressed, and lost not knowing where she was. She was talking about her mother and grandfather coming to pick her up soon at the “motel she was at”, and thinking someone stole her car. It took her a minute to realize it was me,but when she reconnected those dots she cheered up, unlike any conversation she has had with my dad, mom, or sister the past year, and she started asking all kinds of questions about things I didn’t think she’d know about or remember. We were best friends, and I’m so afraid I’m on the edge of losing her. After we hung up the phone, I cried, it’s been two hours, and I’m unable to do anything else but think about the conversation we just had. I just want to see her, but I have no means to, and I just don’t know how when the time comes, I’ll function. 😭","With Alzheimer's, you grieve the loss of your loved one long before they breathe their last breath.  I'm sorry you are experiencing this.

A lot of elderly people really value cards and letters.  Unlike a phone call which is one-and-done, a letter can be re-read many times.  You could make a nice difference in your Grandmother's life if you would send her one card or letter every week.  It probably doesn't come naturally to you because of your generation, but I think it would have a big impact.
Firstly, i want to say I’m so sorry this is affecting your grandmother and now by extension you so badly. My grandmother developed Alzheimer’s when i was in middle school and i spent a good chunk of my teen years being a caregiver. I wouldn’t change my circumstances as i, like you, just wanted to see her. 
The first time she didn’t recognize me, it absolutely felt like a punch in the gut, but worse. I’m sad reading this because i have been in your shoes (in it again with my own mom atm but this ain’t about me) so i fully understand and feel your pain. 
As the commenter above me said, Alzheimer’s is hell because we are grieving the loss of someone who isn’t physically “gone” yet for a long time. I’d also agree with them that cards and letters would be a nice thing to consider. If this isn’t too personal to ask, can she still read ok? Only asking because my mom is at a stage where she’s losing that ability, but I’ve discovered that if i can make her a small painting or piece of art, she really cherishes it and it’s something they can always look at and find new meaning in, and even subconsciously make a connection to you in it in their minds. 
Sorry if this was redundant. You can DM me if you ever want to talk to someone, I’m sadly no stranger to this evil illness. 
Stay strong. I wish i could give you a big hug right now (if you’re into hugs, that is lol) but i hope at least me letting you know that you’re understood and not alone can provide some comfort. Sending tons of love to you and your grandma and family 💜",2022-04-10 17:14:33,Nerve_Several,u0r7tl
Alzheimers,You guys can understand,"If anyone can understand, it’s you guys. 

I (33f) am my dads only caregiver. He doesn’t need full time care necessarily at this point but it’s coming. I teach 75 minutes away from my home so my dad can stay in the home he’s lived in for nearly 30 years and I fully financially take care of my dad except for his small SSI check. 

My sister was going to visit from the other coast and take my dad for a few days while I was on spring break so I could live a few days of my adult life in my own home, getting things done around the house that I can’t get done otherwise. 

Woke up to a text that she’s been covid exposed and is waiting on a test but most likely won’t be able to come out and visit. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t lay in bed sobbing at 6am because I’d gotten my hopes up at having a few days of freedom. 

Tonight, went to check the mail and got the notice that the doctors office didn’t get the form in to IHSS for our initial assessment and so he’s been denied. 

There’s no end in sight and once again I’m laying in bed sobbing. I hate this. I hate my life. I have no help, I can’t get help, and I don’t have hope. I’m beyond burnt out and I’m doing this alone. Entirely alone. 

My friends can’t understand because they don’t live this life. I can’t get to a support group and so my entire therapy sessions are just me desperately crying to my therapist. I don’t need advice. I just need someone to understand what this is.","So sorry you're going through this. For what it's worth, as caregivers, we do relate to what you're going through. It feels like you're using yourself up taking care of your loved one, missing out on your best years. You want so badly to be able to concentrate on yourself... Then you feel guilty and selfish because you want so badly to concentrate on yourself.

I wish I could offer more than to say hang in there, it's not forever, even though it might feel like it. Take the small moments to yourself when you can, and take some solace in knowing you're doing the right thing. In the big scheme of things, that matters.
The role of a primary caregiver is usually a lonely one. Family members may have good intentions, but are not involved on a daily basis, and soon tire of the intrusion into their lives. What's more, they tend to offer advice when they are not familiar with the real circumstances. Because of that they have not been able to develop coping mechanisms to stay in the game.

In ten years, I had about a total of two weeks away, and most of that time was spent in the hospital for surgeries and other things, and the family, frustrated by my mother's behavior brought her back to me, the same day I was released from the hospital. In the beginning, I had a knee replacement and because I couldn't get around, elected to take ten days in rehab, so I could partially recover, but my family could not handle my mom, so they brought her back home and dropped her off, and left her with no way for her to get around or anyone to help, so I got two days of rehab before I had to go home.

You will be criticized for your decision making by family members who feel guilt for their own inabilities. In my case, they've talked behind my back about how she should have been in a nursing home long ago, even though they were not willing to take on that process themselves.

Bringing professional caregivers into a home where you also live is usually not practical, and as the patient advances they may become hostile to strangers in their home.

In my case, two of my sisters are nurses, and when the time finally came, I threw up my hands and forced them to make the arrangements for the care facility. We are now estranged.

It is a lonely road, and the point of my rant is that I do understand. Caregiving for a parent is a noble undertaking that is full of surprises and changes along the way, and only the exceptionally strong are fit for the job, so know that.

I am sorry for your difficulties, but steel yourself, because you have only begun on this journey that's full of twists and turns. Bless you. ❤️
I know the feeling. My wife and I worked hard all our lives and had such grand plans for retirement and this damn disease changed all that. I get up really early so I can have a little me time.

See if you qualify for some in home help.
Oh fuck, Im sorry. I can't offer anything but commiseration, and suggesting a few minutes of cute animal videos.

It's ok to bawl your eyes out. Is there anything you can do to give yourself a treat or reward? Some method of self-soothing or relaxation?
I am so sorry. My mom died four months ago now and I'm still getting myself together. I'm so used to taking her from one appointment to the next and eventually her needing nursing home care where the phone rang multiple times a week regarding her rage, I still can't hear the phone ring without panic kicking in.
I feel your pain 😞  I've been taking care of my parents for 3 years now as an only child with not much help from my own family. Both have dimentia and I was just told two days ago my mom won't be able to ever come back home unless she has 24-7 care at home.  That's going to be impossible for me to do so it's a crap shoot getting the help from DSS. I also just had my first kid and he's only 6 months old so dealing with it all has me literally burnt the fuck out. Praying for you in these tough times sister. My mom always said what you put in into life you'll be rewarded in other things that surround you.  Be patient.  Love your dad. Love yourself.  Your doing a great job thus far and God will repay you in many other ways.  If you ever want to blow off some steam feel free to Pm me. There's no playbook or guide for what we're doing but it's the least we can do for the people that raised us to be great people in life.  Goodluck.  Patience is a virtue 🙏
.Hugs.

That does sound truly devastating. 

I also understand the just crying at the therapist. Mine had hearing aids and discreetly turned them down during our sessions. Hah!
I understand.  Teaching is also high stress and requires a lot of giving as well. Will sister reschedule her visit? Even though you won’t be on break-you could get some relief/normalcy?  Do you have summer off?  Can she come then?  The form—can you re-start the process?  The paperwork and appointments can be so overwhelming and they seem to come in waves.  One step at a time. Write things down and cross them off when done(helps me so I can see progress).  Find small things you can do for yourself. Sometimes it may be having a good cry in the shower.  Or a quiet cup of coffee. It’s so hard and no one truly understands unless they’re living it.  Wishing you well.
100% get everything you’re saying. Sounds like you’ve had a bad week/month which gets very overwhelming. I’ve cried my eyes out more times than I can remember.

And for sure, siblings can’t really understand what we go through - they can say they appreciate all you do, and you can tell them all the stressful things you’re dealing with, but they truly don’t GET it. I hope soon your sister will be able to come give you those few days off, and then not only do you get time to yourself, but she can also see firsthand what it’s been like for you.

Feel free to message me whenever you have a bad moment and just need to vent. Take care

ETA: I know you said you don’t want advice, but I noticed you said you can’t get to a Support Group - the Alzheimer’s Association has free Zoom Caretaker Support Groups - it’s helped me to talk to people that get what’s going on, but also have been dealing with it all for a long time and have wonderful advice 🤍
I very much understand!  I’m 30 F dealing with sharing responsibility with my sister for my mom (70 F) and her care. My dad died about 6 months ago and my mom is still living at home but unable to do instrumental tasks (cooking, cleaning, filling her own meds). It’s been a massive struggle especially since I’m expecting my first baby in about 6 weeks. I get burnt out very easily and it’s so hard to not get frustrated. Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk. It’s hard, just starting out in your life, and having to take care of a parent.
Denied for what?
Big hugs. Hear you loud and clear. If everyone could just stop *NEEEEEEDING* me for an effing minute, I would be soooo happy. And if health insurance, etc. would just stop finding ways to screw me over, deny, foot-drag, adding insult to injury, that would be heaven. The disease I could almost cope with, but the shit system of US laissez-faire capitalist Mangled Hell Care is the thing that's really messing me up.
I understand.  \*Hugs\*",2022-04-10 01:17:01,Brilliant-Coast-2222,u0argc
Alzheimers,Does oxygen prolong life,"Hello so trigger warning i guess is in order but a week ago we had to put our dog down as she was in pain from a tumor and that night my grandma stopped eating and the morning after she stopped drinking so it was obvious she was starting to decline and looking to be entering the death process on  Wednesday she seemed to get worse and worse by the day and by that morning her 02 sats were ""low 90s high 80s"" friday she calmed down enough to have her go to a nursing home because her care was overwhelming mom and she required almost 24/7 care so we had her transported there and we came to visit that night and they had a o2 tube in her nose which confused us so we asked and they told us her 02 during transport was 71 so they put a tube in and then they just kept it going at the home i get them doing it during a transport but not at the home they say its for her comfort and wont prolong death but i dont buy it to be honest it seems like a part of death and i feel some people with alzheimers die this way so it seems like eliminating a way of death which to me is prolonging death at a certain point her body just wont function on that low of a oxygen level so giving her oxygen seems like prolonging i get that it might be for comfort but to me death is uncomfortable the body doesnt like dying i can understand the morphine and haldol because those dont do anything other than help with pain and restlessness it doesnt help life but the oxygen seems like it would help her live longer she needs to pass soon and quickly she wouldve hated living like this and she would want it to be as quick as could happen also this nursing home is questionable i went to check on her today and the door was wide open which would be fine if i didnt walk in on her completely naked on the bottom edge of her bed just sprawled out and she had a few visitors earlier shes supposed to get morphine every hour an haldol every two hours both people said in the few hours they were there they never had a nurse come in and they had to get them to go give her her medicine which irritates me so im kinda questionable on their opinion so id like an outside opinion

TL;DR: My grandma is dying shes at a nursing home and they have her on O2 which confuses me since it seems like it would prolong life the home says its just for comfort but it seems as if it would prolong life im all for comfort but death is uncomfortable and it seems like they are preventing that way of death so does O2 prolong life","Not an expert. My understanding is that oxygen just makes it easier to breathe, it doesn’t heal infection or damage to the lungs it just makes it so your lungs don’t have to work as hard for basic breathing. It’s not the same as intubation.
PS i’m very sorry for the loss of your dog and your grandma. My grandma died at home in March. It was about 36 hours from the time we started to notice the “death rattle” sound (a hybrid of gargling and snoring) on Sunday evening until we found her gone early Tuesday morning
Thank you for your condolences my thing would be breathing stopping is part of death so it kinda feels like prolonging life especially when her O2 went from 71 to 91 in a day but if it just makes breathing easier that’s alright thanks for the insight and I’m sorry to hear about your grandmother hope all is well with you and family
Sounds like you need to get hospice involved instead of a nursing home. She will just need a doctor referral, I'm pretty sure.

Also do you guys have a medical directive? We have one for my dad that covers all types of care and we made a decision as a family what we would allow and not allow. Takes the pressure off last minute decisions.
I am an RN on a dementia unit.  I see this a lot.  Current belief is that supplemental oxygen is for comfort.  In addition, we administer Ativan liquid and morphine at scheduled intervals.  Most of my residents pass quietly and (I assume) comfortably.
I assume your parents or other relatives are your grandmother's medical POA, and have already had end-of-life discussions to know what she would want.  Leave these decisions to whoever is the POA.  You don't need to understand the reasons for the interventions.

If she is not being medicated on schedule, call it to the home's attention and ask for an explanation.  Also inform the medical POA, usually a relative.",2022-04-10 02:55:29,Deafboy25,u0c5ma
Alzheimers,Psych hospitalization—how to cope,"Hi there, my dad lives in a memory care unit. He has become aggressive with staff which is so opposite his personality. I know it’s just the dementia progression. He got admitted to psych this evening and they called me to tell me they had to restrain him to his bed because he assaulted a nurse. I am devastated. I’m not used to this part of the disease and I’m just wondering what happens after this. How much worse does it get? I am the only one responsible for his decision making/care and I just want to know what to expect. This is so painful; I can’t even believe this is a real illness.","Without having any information on your father's case: what other care options have been tried? We frequently have aggressive patients who only get combative during personal care. The kind choice can be to deal with a smelly resident, and reduce the amount of showers given etc. Sometimes hygiene care REALLY can't be avoided, but often the frequently can be turned down by a lot. 

Same goes for 'having to sit at the table' or being woken up/ sent to bed/ interrupted from wandering etc. Often the nurses are trying what they think is best, but it's not always what's right for the patient. Your permission to adapt his care can go a long way.
So sorry you're dealing with this aspect of the disease. Is he on any mood stabilizers?
I know what you mean about not being able to believe it’s a real disease. I am a nurse and we get situations like your dad very frequently. Physical restraints are used temporarily until chemical restraints (mood stabilizer and such) are adjusted to a new level required to keep the patient calm. This stage of the disease lasts for a wide variety of time from person to person, but it doesn’t last forever. Some it’s just a short time, they respond to medication quickly, some needs multiple readjustments of medication. 

Allow the doctors to medicate your dad as much as necessary. You and he would both prefer chemical restraints to physical restraints, and it’s ok to tell that to his doctor, in order to emphasize not to keep him in physical restraints longer than necessary.  In my experience, some doctors are too conservative with medication and the patient ends up in physical restraints for days.  But finding that balance is hard, because you also don’t want the patient “snowed” or asleep for days due to medications. Still, being asleep is better than being awake and restrained. 

It may trigger him more to have you visit so sometimes it’s a good idea to hold off, but you can check with his nurses about what his mood is prior to and after your visits to see how it affects him. When you do see your dad, try to think of him not as your dad but as someone who is afraid. He doesn’t know where he is or what is happening to him. It may help you to disassociate, at least during the visit.
I'm so sorry. I'm with you on ""I can't even believe this is a real illness."" It's so cruel.
I would sign him up for the Cassava Sciences pre-screening for their drug in trial. Every patient has shown improvement from as little as 27 days. It is on their website. You can sign up for him. Please take a look.

Alzheimers,*also posted in r/dementia* Wanderer in mother's facility getting into mom's bed at night,"My mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. Last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. She was understandably terrified and had a meltdown. Lots of ""I need to get out of here"" and ""I am going to stop eating"". We got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything ""clean"".  It seems like it isn't the first time this poor man has done this but it's usually not at night. 

Mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her ""apartment"" (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or  not), but she must have not locked it. We talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. So all seemed to be under control. 

Until it happened again two nights ago. There's definitely no malicious intent by this poor man - he's definitely unaware of just about everything around him. However - my mother needs to feel secure in her room. 

Has anyone experienced this before as either the LO of a wanderer into other people's rooms or as a person who's LO has a wanderer show up in their room?  I am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. TIA.","My husband who gets into my personal stuff at home, is now doing the same thing at adult day care.  Staff informed me yesterday he has been going through other people's purses or backpacks and taking items out.  I asked him about this and he denied doing it, but I trust staff's memory of events better than I trust his!

I know it's not the same as wandering, but kind of similar.  No sense of boundaries any more.

No advice, just wanted you to know this is definitely a feature of the disease.  Good luck to your poor mom.  Could the facility alarm her door during sleep hours?
I'm sorry, I find it totally unacceptable that patients are allowed to wander at night. There is all kinds of alarms/technology to prevent this. You never know what could happen to them or other residents. I saw one little old lady that would just up and slap other residents. It's on the facility to make sure residents are safe. You must stay on management, most are profit driven, but you are a vital link in oversight. Raise hell if necessary, I'm sure your paying$$$_.
Your mom’s right to feel safe trumps this man’s freedom to wander at night. I have no doubt he has no clue as to what he is doing; nonetheless, the facility needs to control this behavior or he needs a new level of care. If this were happening to my mother I would be most unhappy.

They need to handle it.
you need to raise hell with the facility. take this all the way up to the top. say everything you said in this post. that it happened once, you were understanding, they told you the solution they would implement, you accepted that, and then it happened a second time and that’s entirely unacceptable. 

it sucks for the family of the man, but you have your own loved one to worry about so I would say that if the staff isn’t capable of protecting your mother from another patient, either those staff members or that patient needs to be removed. and you want monetary reparation on top of that since you’re paying $$$ for the safety and security of the room and its occupant and you’re not getting that, twice now. 

Say you’re considering leaving a couple of reviews online about the negligence of the staff there, and how unsafe your mom feels because they apparently have no alarms, locks, safety measures or competent staff in place to prevent people from wandering at night. that’ll get their attention. 

don’t *expect* them to give you any compensation (and dont threaten to remove her, i’m sure they have a waitlist a mile long and will gladly take you up on that threat), but reminding them that you’re financially invested and have the power of google reviews might put a fire under their ass to do better. 

honestly though, get her on a waitlist for another facility. it seems as though you can’t trust the staff at this one to do their jobs. If the night staff get fired over this, and i say this as a professional caregiver myself, they absolutely deserve to lose their jobs for this level of negligence. it is NOT hard to prevent this situation with 24 hour AWAKE staff plus modern technology...i’d worry about where they are dropping the ball in other places. or that despite the crazy amount of money each resident pays to stay there they are purposely understaffing to make more money. 

I know moving someone with dementia is hard and expensive but this is so unacceptable to me and would raise so many concerns about the quality of the staff and the safety measures they have in place. that man should never even be ABLE to leave his room after bed time. ridiculous. I hope you get this sorted promptly, they give you a discount for her disrupted month, and they hire new night staff.
Oh my god.. I’m sorry but your poor mother, I can’t even imagine how terrified she must have been.  This is unacceptable
My dad was the wanderer but I sort of think he was doing it on purpose because the only part of his mind that worked was the, ""where da ladies at?"" part. We'd show up looking for him and the staff would have to go into the ladies' rooms looking for him. No one ever said he was upsetting anyone and as far as I know the staff tried to keep track of him. He finally stopped. I sure hope he didn't scare anyone.
bed alarm for him.

maybe one of those child safety locks for her door.... so she can get out but it takes a non-dementia person to figure out how to open it
what facility? i am looking for a good one for my dad. feel free to pm if you want.

sorry that is happening :(",2022-04-09 07:48:46,cobaltsvaleria,tzrkv7
Alzheimers,Medicare Wounded Alzheimer's Disease and Future Research,"Regardless of people's thoughts about aducanumab, the Medicare decision will go down in history as seriously misguided.  So they feel that it doesn't work, that's fine, but that's also not their role.  That's the FDA's job, and they granted it accelerated approval.  For cancer drugs, the meds then get covered.  For AD, the [Medicare decision](https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/ncacal-decision-memo.aspx?proposed=N&ncaid=305&fromTracking=Y&ncacaldoctype=all&status=all&sortBy=status&bc=17) states it will not be covered outside a RCT.  

Several problems I can think of off the top of my head: 

1. This is a double standard unless cancer treatments are given the same non-coverage decision.  This increases the stigma of an already stigmatized disease.  
2. This puts serious headwinds into AD innovation and drug development.  Why spend a billion dollars on a trial in AD when facing TWO hurdles: both FDA and Medicare?  
3. This regulatory over-reach will cause chaos if applied to other divisions within government.  Imagine the CDC disapproving a vaccine that the FDA approves.  
4. This harms individual patients who can't get into trials for a variety of reasons: access, language barriers, patchy social support, exclusionary meds or diseases.  They are basically told to F-off.","Alzheimer's is a golden goose for the pharmaceutical company that creates an effective treatment. Medicare's model doesn't include long term care.
Thanks for this post. What about for folks already using Aducanumab? Will they also need to enter a RCT?
It *looks* like in practice this could translate as ""we will cover this phase 3 fda approved drug of this class, if it were in what would essentially be like a phase 4 study but with a bunch additional monitoring criteria not usually needed in a phase 4 study""? 

Does a rule like this exist for any other kind of drug or drug type? 

Could you play the devils advocate here (because you know more about these things) and think of a reason the double standard compared to cancer meds could be justified? Maybe the nature of getting the outcome info they want would essentially be from longitudinal data that could be time prohibitive for it to ever complete a phase 3 trial, but is important for seeing if its worth it? I understand it to be the case that cancer meds that ""work"" only extend life for a short time more (like months or a couple years) and maybe its easier to predict when a participants time in the trial will end.

You said its fine that they are doubtful it works, but what alternative measure do you think would be suitable for addressing the doubt? Maybe if the FDA created a type of study phase (something between a phase 3 and 4) that could include language like this, and medicare created language that referred to the fdas criteria for coverage? That would put more of the onus back on the fda.

Sorry i have only a bit of understanding about clinical trials (i worked in them, but not a career professional) and very poor familiarity with medicare.
Yes, it’s over-reach, but it’s less “I don’t think this will work” and more “we can’t afford it.”  The cost would almost double Medicare D drug spending if 10% of the patients start taking it.  Estimated at approximately $32B.  This same type of oversight is being administered via only paying various percentages of drugs in their arbitrary tiers.  Don’t see how this is any different really.  My wife’s 90 day supply of meds just cost $2700 a few weeks ago.  It’s price gouging.

Edit:  The fact that Biogen just reduced the cost from $56K for a year supply to $27K seems to bear that out.
It's important to also note that medicare's decision also blocks all future amyloid monoclonal antibodies effectively killing this line of treatment regardless of if a new one comes along that cures AD.  And this decision cannot be reversed without a 2 year wait period.

Alzheimers,Don't-Care-Caregivers,"Phew, documentary filmmaking is running me ragged, but I got some time this week to write a couple of caregiver tales!

[Don't-Care-Caregivers: What are the options when you feel like you're out of options?](https://www.stumpedtowndementia.com/post/don-t-care-caregiver)

p.s. Uh, the film is looking pretty amazing! I'm hoping to have a  trailer or first look vid done in the next couple of weeks to share  online.","Wow, I'm still reading but I had to stop to write this:  
I'm just after another crazy episode with my mother, scrolling through Reddit. with one hand on my head thinking of post here this exact same question!  


I just can't do it anymore. my life is ruining, I lost my job, I've depression, NOBODY want's to be with her because she was a horrible person all her life let alone stay and live with her.  


The only reason I'm doing it for the last 3+ years is that I  can't handle the thought of her being dragged to some institute, I was hoping I could handle it at least she'll ""lose it"" and won't be here in her mind.  


I lost my job, I  lost my GF, My Family doctor already knows that I got depression because of this.  


She called the police on me (they're ignoring her already).  
She kick me out of the house at least 30 times during these 3 years after I spend a day collecting my stuff, hiring movers she then calls me anytime between 2 hours to 10 hours later begging me to come back.

  
I've reached the point that I just can't do it anymore. I just CAN'T.  


I lost so many things in the process, I basically will have to rebuild my life when this is over.  


Sorry, just venting out, but I wanted to say the timing of this article was fucking on point.  
Thank you.  


Going back to read, stay strong guys.

Alzheimers,"Seeing the Humor In It, AKA Laughing through the pain","Story I'd like to share. My grandpa has been slowly losing his memories as Alzheimer's takes its toll. He's recently been moved into the memory care unit of his nursing home, and myself and the rest of the family do what we can to visit and talk to him regularly. His ""conversational loops"" are becoming more and more frequent - asking questions multiple times in a single conversation that he's just asked. The thing is, Grandpa has been a wickedly funny man his whole life, and yesterday he commented on his memory loss and the loops himself. 

""I know my memory is slipping here, but the great news about that is that you can never run out of things to tell me. I'm incapable of being bored!"" 

I don't know who needs to hear this today, but growing older and losing one's memory is tragic and funny, all rolled up in a confusing yarn ball. 

Its ok to be sad. Its ok to laugh. Its ok to do both at the same time.","I was watching news with my grandma and bringing her cut up apples, smack dab in the middle of an Ukranian war segment. She goes ""You know what's really tragic here?""

I held my breath, this is it, a truth about life is coming. 

""I thought you were bringing me potatoes.""
We look for the humor too.  My grandma is still in assisted living. She getting closer and closer to needing more care. But so far she's able to stay pretty safe and independent in her little apartment. My Grandpa passed almost 10 years ago.  For some reason, one of her phrases is ""gonna need to find herself a boyfriend"" .... I always ask her why she'd want to go and do a thing like that (growing up she always teased me by telling me to never get married, men were too much work)  after that she usually laughs and responds with ""Well, I don't know, I sure don't want a man""  She has developed many baffling quirks, we always try to find the humor.
My wife and I have found out we are going to be parents. Telling my mother in law that she is going to be a grandmother gets her excited everytime. She usually forgets it shortly after, but to see that reaction again and again is cute. It has its moments very rarely.
We Skyped with our daughter a few days ago and every time my wife walked past I would show her the phone and it was a new experience every time seeing the kid.
Thank you for that, needed the chuckle! Boy do I relate to the endless loop ….",2022-04-07 10:21:29,SOILSYAY,tye4ss
Alzheimers,I need help,"my grandma got diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia something like that

please tell me how bad it is im shaking she’s only 60 

is it true she will only live about 6-7 more years? im 13 she won’t even live to have my first drink with me

is it really one step down from full Alzheimer’s??? please don’t sugar coat the truth","The truth:  nobody can answer your question.  It's different for each person.  I've heard of people who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's and still living 20 years later!  Not the most common outcome, but I think I made my point.
If a drink with your grandma was something you were looking forward to, you can do it now. One drink won't hurt anyone, even if you are just 13.
I recommend reading the book “Somebody I Used to Know” by Wendy Mitchell. She was also diagnosed with early-onset dementia around the same age. One possible benefit to an early diagnosis is that decline can be slower. My mother was diagnosed four years ago at 64 and while she has lost some cognitive abilities, her progression so far has been slow. Guessing someone with dementia’s longevity is hard, but I would say enjoy the time you have with her now. Having a loved one with dementia forces you to really live in the present moment with them. Sorry you are going through this.
I believe you are asking about frontotemporal dementia (FTD)

With my wife it has been a vicious and fast progressing disease.

I know at 13 you are ready to start talking about adult things, but the details and the way this disease changes a person is something everyone should avoid learning about. Watching what this disease has done to my wife has been the toughest thing I have had to deal with in my life.

My advice to you, is make memories with your grandma now, knowing that very soon this disease will change her into a different and very unpleasant person.
All cases are different in terms of speed of progression.  Know this....your grandma will eventually act out in ways she can't control. Remember it's not her, but her diseased brain.  Cherish the good times. Remember her as she is.",2022-04-07 01:54:09,charatatata,ty6abn
Alzheimers,Siblings,"How does everyone handle things with their siblings when it's a parent who needs care? I have one sibling who is great with my dad and very involved but we have a volatile relationship, and one sibling who I'm close to and get along with but who acts like this isn't happening and acts like talking about it is crazy and ""none of her business."" She loves our dad but is a pretty head-in-the-sand kind of person. I don't know how to get conversations and plans going about my dad's care without starting a fight.","Hello, 
I had a very similar situation with my sister. I was the live-in caretaker for my mom and step dad and she was in the same city. We had silly sister problems and had a hard time being in the same room. 
I was drowning in caring for them, having some mental health issues because of the toll of caregiver fatigue. We sat down with a social worker and talked about how I needed her support. Progress was slow, but 4 years later she is my best friend and we depend on eachother a lot. Our mom is now in the late stage and in a memory care unit. 
Please give your sibling the offer of support before they reach that point.
Literally same scenario, my wife and I are the caretakers to my mother in law with mid stages alzheimers. Her son who lives 10 mins away visits once or maybe twice a month. Hasn't done much for her care and I believe doesn't like seeing his mother in her condition. Unfortunately you cannot change them to make them care more, Either they are willing or not. It's a bad situation and I would wish all parties put the same effort in.
I don't know and I've been trying to figure it out myself. It's like every bad sibling interaction from childhood on is happening again with my sisters. It's tearing us apart and I'm thinking it'll not be repaired. 

My brain is tired tonight but it's like family roles, our roles as siblings and roles with parents have created patterns that got worse with ailing parents. 

If I could redo the last few years I'd ensure that my step up sister didn't take on so much. It's very unfair to her. I'd also care less about worrying that I'd step on toes or hurt feelings and care more about stuff just getting done. 

However my family is supremely dysfunctional lol.
The sibling who is good with your dad:  support her every way possible.  Bring meals, do chores, drive dad places, give her money and ask if there's anything else you can do.  Hint:  most caregivers could you use a respite caregiver so they can get to the dentist or have their hair cut.

The ostrich sister (head in sand) you can email her with details of how dad's doing the past three months.  Mention if he's losing weight, is he sleeping well, what goofy thing has he done lately (my DH recently peed in a wastebasket in the night, but didn't remember doing it).  Don't ask her for help, but at least she's in the loop when possibly bigger decisions need to be made.
This can really be tough.  There were five of us.  First we had to identify who our parents had put in charge if any.  Asked them.  Hunted for papers to find out who was the Power of Attorney.  Fortunately for us, our parents had named one of us as POA.  Even though this was established, no matter what, setting up a family meeting with a social worker really is important & majorly helpful.  You could have a social worker come to your parents house with or without a nurse and evaluate your parents needs.  Once the social worker knows what is needed, a seperate meeting could occur with all family members present to hear what mom and dad need.  Responsibilities can be assigned to each in the SW presence to avoid conflict.  Remember though, you need to consider the life of each person.  For example, I had a brother who was currently taking care of his inlaws.  There was no way he could split his money & time to help out with our parents.  It's not that it wasn't his responsibility,  his plate was already full.  Three of us really worked to help our parents out and we were successful.  It wasn't without conflict, upsets, repeated conversations, I'm sorry's. & tears.  We focused on what each person had to offer.  Where there strengths were with our parents.  This helped alot.

If you don't have a POA then ask the social worker what can be done to do this.  It might take a day in court to be established but will give you legal access to handling their affairs.  I hope this helps.",2022-04-06 16:50:54,Snoo23577,txvxar

Alzheimers,My mom just got diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Advice?,"My mom has been seeing a neurologist and a few months ago she took some kind of written test to see whether she has Alzheimer's or not. I'm not entirely sure what the test results were as my mom can be rather private about her health and down play things, but the doctor ordered a brain MRI for her. My mom sat me down yesterday and told me that the MRI does show Alzheimer's. She has not been back in to see the neurologist yet as the doctor is booked out pretty far, but my mom is on the wait list for an appointment so hopefully she gets in soon. I'm not sure how far along the Alzheimer's is or if they can tell that from the MRI, but my mom seems to think she only has 4-5 years left. She turns 57 this month. 

I have suspected for a few months now that she may have Alzheimer's as she has been having memory problems for a while (started when I was in high school) but have noticeably gotten worse recently. Also, Alzheimer's does run in her family. She did have a brain MRI done 2-3 years ago (I'm not sure if it was related to her memory issues or not) and they said that everything was normal; I'm not sure if maybe they missed something or if there really were no signs on the MRI yet. These past few months I have been worried about her. She forgets things we have recently spoken about, sometimes as close as ten minutes ago. She cannot remember if she's taken her medication or eaten. She forgets what she was doing. She doesn't clean things up around the house (i.e her dog pooped indoors and she just left it there). She forgets to bathe. However, I do think things are worse than that. She told me yesterday that she's scared to drive as she thinks she will kill herself or someone else because she forgets to do things such as check both ways before pulling out of somewhere; I didn't know her driving had been affected. I'm sure there's more that she hasn't told me. She wasn't even going to tell me the results of the MRI and was going to pretend that everything was normal but my dad convinced her otherwise. She has not told my younger brother yet.

I feel very lost. I'm about to be 24, so I know that I'm an adult, but I'm still finding my footing in the adult world and trying to figure out my place. I don't want to lose my mom. I know I have to step up and help her, though I have no doubt that she will try to leave me out of everything and handle it herself, as she doesn't want to feel like a burden though I have assured her that she is not one. I'm sure my dad will help her with things but, while they are still friends, they have been divorced for over a decade and he works long, demanding hours. She has a lot of stuff that needs to get in order (i.e multiple properties, investments, a trust, etc.) I wouldn't mind moving in with her to help her but she will not let me. She says that she will stay in her house for now, and hire someone to come during the days to help her. And when that no longer works/helps, she will move into a care home. 

I just wanted to confide in y'all and hopefully get some advice. My mom has told me not to tell any of my friends, which I understand and respect, but it means that I have no one outside my family to talk to about this. 

For those who have a parent that has been affected by Alzheimer's, what was it like? What should I prepare myself for? What is something that you wish you had been told? How do I help someone who feels bad about asking for help? Any and all advice is helpful.","Going forward, you will find that unless someone has a parent with dementia, especially early onset, they just will not truly get what you are going through. Having a grandparent with dementia is not the same thing. You will find that the best support and understanding you receive is from others in the same boat as you. This is a dreadful situation for you, your Mom, and your whole family but it is VERY positive that your Mom has handled this 1000% perfectly imo, in order to cause everyone the least amount of grief and upset as possible going forward. Hiring caregivers and then going into a facility and NOT looking to young-adult children to take on caregiving is 100% what's best for her and you. Her words right now are very important - don't forget them. She wants you to remain her daughter, not become her caregiver. You can't be both. And she wants you to continue your life path, even though you're going to feel rotten and have difficulties and life will be different, you've got to stay on your educational/career/social path and not be derailed by this. This will give her peace and will help you immensely in the future. It's a gift that she has told you her wishes. Many adult caregivers of parents with dementia are totally breaking down under the stress of caregiving, and wondering what our parent would want if they were in their right mind, or if our parent would understand if we need a break and have to hire professionals or place them in a facility. You already have all that information right from your Mom's own mouth.  Dementia varies A LOT from one person to another so keep in mind that your Mom's symptoms and experience may be different from what other people tell you about. Also, unless your Mom has vascular dementia and a history of strokes, I think her 4-5 year life expectancy prediction will probably be wrong. Right now, just enjoy her and try to focus on what she still has rather than what is deteriorating. I'd like to go back to times that I previously was complaining about - because I didn't realize at the time how good things still were. I'm really sorry this has happened to you and your family.
I’m 20 years old, my grandma had dementia from around 70 I would say. She’s 80 now, however I haven’t had to take care of since 2 years ago. I wish I could give lots of great advice, but I’m still learning myself. Just don’t take anything personally (don’t get upset when she forgets who you are), don’t be afraid to take breaks and give yourself some personal time, it’s better to leave/end a convo then it is to argue. Also, it gets easier, you learn what works and doesn’t
I was a few years older than you when my dad diagnosed. I’m so sorry you have to go through this. It’s not fair. Being young makes it even more unfair. 

I highly recommend getting an elder law attorney as soon as you can. They can help you get durable power of attorney, health care power of attorney, etc. They can also help you navigate your mom’s assets. Its important to do this while your mom is still mentally capable. 

One thing that’s not fun to think about, but important, is to talk to your mom about her final wishes. You can plan and prepay for her funeral. You can ask the funeral home to store the funds in a way that makes it so Medicaid can’t take them. It’s also important to make sure there’s nothing left unsaid between you and your mom. Coping with the prolonged grief is so incredibly difficult, but by making sure there’s nothing left unsaid may give you a sense of peace along with the grief. 

The Alzheimer’s Association helpline (800-272-3900) has helped me a few times when I had questions and I wasn’t sure where to turn to. They are extremely caring and helpful. 

I also recommend starting therapy and making sure you take care of yourself. It’s easy to burn yourself out and effect your health when so much of your energy is going to taking care of someone with this disease. It’s also important to make sure you still live your life, you only get one.
I dont have much advice but ill share my story in hopes something resonates with you. I was 29 when my dad was originally diagnosed with AD in 2019 (since then was diagnosed with CBD/CBS). Every day for a month straight after diagnosis, i cried. All day. i felt so lost too. I went to work at cried at my desk. I was a wreck. But every time i saw my dad, i was okay. I didnt cry. We talked and laughed and made plans. It was nice. But when id leave, all id think about was him and just sob. Things have progressed (or regressed) and its now hard to see him but i can cherish every second im with him. Having him keep talking about childhood memories and music makes him light up He is so happy when he remembers the life hes lived. Its such BS though that we have to go through this. Its not fair. I get so jealous when i see my friends with their parents, enjoying retirement. I know that its okay to feel that, and any other feelings or emotions that surface. Sometimes its oddly comforting to know that others your age are also dealing with this. 

Hang in there.
My Mom is much older than yours and she was diagnosed a year ago.  I'm not sure how you can prepare yourself, but there are a lot of resources out there.  [https://www.aanhr.org/documents/resources/alzheimersplaybook.pdf](https://www.aanhr.org/documents/resources/alzheimersplaybook.pdf)

I found the attached to be helpful.  

Best to you and your family.
Hello. Sorry you have to go through this. My dad was diagnosed in 2015 when I was 19 and he was 62. He had been showing symptoms for many years. My dad is now in a full time care facility and he has lost all his abilities. He started to forget me 4 years ago, him and I were the closest and had a very strong relationship. 
I want you to know that it will be hard. You will be grieving and you will be frustrated with your mother. But you'll regret not spending all the time in the world and taking care of her. Please be patient with her. I wish I knew how little time we actually had. My dad got extremely depressed shortly after the diagnosis and kept talking about suicide. He got anti depressives and stopped mentioning it.
Sorry if my comments doesn't make sense. I dont really know what to mention as there's so many things. Ask me anything if you want.
It's hard... very hard.  In 2019, my Mom, 61 years old, was diagnosed with early onset AD -- which, like your Mom, ran in her family.  Unfortunately it's impossible to know exactly how much longer someone with EOAD has, but generally, in the case of EOAD, the long-term prognosis is not great.  Honestly, that doesn't really matter now.  You're going to be taking things one day at a time.  And then later it'll become one hour at a time.  She's going to become very confused, very disoriented.  It's very likely she'll lose any social filter and start saying mean, hurtful things.  She'll become frustrated very quickly, and confuse peoples' identities and relationships with one another.  Prepare yourself now for these things so you don't end up taking them personally when they happen.  My mom has just fairly recently lost track of her grandkids' names (there's only 3 of them) and about a year ago lost track of who's kids are who's and who's wife is who's, but she still seems to very clearly know my brothers and I.  It's the disease that's doing this to your Mom and mine, and it's a fucking awful, no good, bag of shit disease.

If she's not keen on accepting help, then don't be keen on offering it -- you're likely to just frustrate her.  But be present.  Help out subtly when and where you can.  If the dog pooped in the house and she's skipped over cleaning it, then just clean it and keep life moving on.  Keep tabs on her Rx and daily intakes to make sure everything's happening as it should -- and nothing's happening that shouldn't be happening.  If she's second guessing her ability to drive, then that must be stopped immediately.  For her safety and everyone else's.  Don't bother trying to correct her memories and thoughts -- that too will frustrate her, and it's a futile effort anyway.  Do what you can to be as present and patient as possible.  It's very, very hard on the family, but also it's our Moms that are the ones constantly confused, disoriented, and trying to figure out day-to-day life when nothing makes sense anymore.

Another thing... be kind and patient with yourself too.  Forgive yourself.  Take breaks when you need them.  This is going to be a heavy lift for the family, and no one person can do it alone -- it's just too emotionally and physically demanding.
My dad was not diagnosed until 2018 with Alzheimer's and we suspect he'd had it since 2009 or so. He had a severe decline over 2020 and we ended up needing to move him to memory care early 2021 as my mom could no longer care for him. My dad passed away at 71 in November of 2021 and the last few years of his life were some of the most challenging. It really shook me. It's going to be incredibly difficult, OP. If you have personal friends/family who have experience, reach out to them. I found this subreddit to be particularly helpful in my darkest moments. I'm sorry, OP.
Hold her close and enjoy your time while you can. Ask all the questions and get all the history and life stories while you can. Good luck and God bless.
Hi. 
Just wanted to say your story brought me to tears, as it’s bizarrely similar to mine.
I’m only 19, but my mother was diagnosed about a year ago (the date should pass any day now) through her spinal fluid. 
She also started showing signs around the time I started high school. At the time she was a registered nurse, but just before the diagnosis she lost her job at Trader Joe’s. 
At that point, my father was giving her a lift to work and home every day. When I was 18, she destroyed her car in a wreck because she somehow completely missed seeing someone right in front of her. We managed to hide it from the insurance company but she no longer drives, which I think was the best decision. 
**If this hasn’t happened a lot yet, expect it to start.**
*Issues with word retrieval and connecting words to their meanings.*
It’s not uncommon for my mother to hear what I say and even repeat it back to me perfectly, but have no damn clue what I mean, no matter how simply I’ve worded it. 
*Starting a sentence, and forgetting halfway through it.*
My mom will sometimes start, trail off for a moment, and then either forget what she was trying to say or forget she was saying anything at all. 

[I’m so sorry](https://media1.giphy.com/media/VbawWIGNtKYwOFXF7U/giphy.gif?cid=5e214886u84e181f67gwjtuquj7i66dv0s07dhtyzki3qhpe&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) you’re in this situation, and I hope it can bring you some comfort (even if it’s in the most fucked up way possible) that I understand your situation better than most people would. 

[This song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4iGsNju-MGw) from my all-time favorite musical has brought me a lot of comfort, and I cry to it almost daily now. 

Hope I could help somehow. 🤍
The whole process is brutal. My mom showed signs as far back as 2006 when I was 31 and she was 71. One random day she started packing her car full of ""stuff"" and wanted to leave with no destination while sticking the key in the A/C vent. She had already stopped driving 3 years earlier. 2 years later she was already getting lost in her own neighborhood, wandering in parking lots when told to wait, and telling outlandish stories that made no sense and her memories were already bad at that point. By late 2016 (literally 10 years later), she was clearly already in late stage dementia and had no idea what was going on anymore. Prior to that I was fortunate that I had older tenants that rented rooms in her house that kind of looked after her. My father who was divorced since I was a child also came around so that helped too.

I finally had to move back with mom along with my family when she got to the late late stages of the disease in 2018. She got to the point where she would just wander mindlessly in circles around the house, talking to her delusions, and go to bathroom in trash cans, or on the floor at times. Later that year she had no idea who I was anymore and I am her only child. In late 2020 she lost the ability to stand and has been bedridden ever since. She is currently 87 and is completely motionless for over 17 months stuck in a hospital bed and just mumbles to herself all day long.

To say her existence is downright horrible is an understatement and we all suffer right along with her because we really can't go anywhere now and haven't done much of anything for about 4 years and I have to do literally everything for her. I truly believe my mom's case is an outlier case as most patients don't last this long from what I hear from others (even her own doctor put her on hospice 2 years ago and didn't think she would make it far along into 2021), yet here we are still.

Nothing about this disease is predictable or easy. Some days are better than others, the worst years for me were 2018-2020 when she was basically an out of control angry zombie like personality and would try to cause damage with any items or furniture that she passed by. Now she can't do anything so it's a more controlled environment with lots of downtime, but very hard to watch none the less. It doesn't seem like she is long for the world at this point, but we said the exact same thing last April. The hardest part for me now is juggling her care while trying to offer a normal childhood for my two kids, but fortunately my wife helps me alot with the things I just can't do right now. In the end, life teaches you how to be creative with everything you have, especially when nothing else makes sense anymore. We all know eventually this nightmare will be over. Hope this helps, good luck!
My best advice is a second opinion with a memory specialist neurologist.  Misdiagnosis is common in the 50s age group and a brain MRI cannot show Alzheimer's.  They are not very diagnostic and at most you can try to appreciate patterns of atrophy typically seen in Alzheimer's but it's not too absolute.  A spinal tap looking for AD markers or an amyloid PET scan would be much much more useful than an MRI.

Everything that you described is also seen in pseudo dementia as well so it is important to make sure a miss diagnosis has not occurred.
My father is now mid to late stages and while I’m older than you this might help. 
Try to spend plenty of quality time with your mom now and take pictures. Eg go to parks, zoos, beach, hikes. Make some nice memories for yourself. 
Try to get your mom on a good diet now. Decent nutrition Will help keep her mind healthy longer, whether it’s meal delivery service or whatever. 
Do those legal things, even though it will likely be awful. Also find the care home she likes now so there are fewer questions later. 
Best wishes
I appreciate you sharing your story. 30 years old here with my mom getting diagnosed with EO a few months ago at age 59. It has rocked our world as it has not run in her family up until this point. 

I had joined a support group for a meeting but all the caregivers are also older and just felt like I couldn’t connect with them. If you or anyone else would like to connect just to talk and vent about being a young adult who has to deal with this shit situation, I’d love to find a way for us to find a forum to do so.",2022-04-06 09:50:13,carolion98,txmmwb
Alzheimers,Alzheimer's Association push to get Aduhelm approved -NYT,"Personally I'd rather see the Alz association focus on getting long term care covered by Medicare, using the same force and energy they're using for this drug. Or they could do a better job of creating more local support groups. Or publishing more useful guides - it's interesting to me that many of the great guides or books like Teepa Snow never seem to be recommended by them.

Alzheimers,Most mornings I make breakfast for my MIL. I try to give her a variety of items that she can pickup with her hands since using utensils is too difficult for her now. Today we had French Toast bites and some fruit.,,"Nice. We too have gone to all finger food and an air fryer has helped quite a bit. Wife gets Ensure for breakfast.
That's a really smart idea to cut up French toast like that. I bet dad would love that. Thanks for posting! 😊
Really nice. For my mom, we found that small portions really helped. She would get easily overwhelmed by volume.
Bless you. This is lovely. 💕
Yep, finger-food grazing plates are the way to go!

Alzheimers,Tips for dealing with hostility?,"Tl;dr: mom's sick and hostile towards me. How best can I help her, and keep us both safe, until the doctor sees her?

My mom gets incredibly agitated when she's sick and with a fever. She pushes me and grabs my arms and I've no idea how to help her in these situations to calm her down or how best to handle myself when she has me losing my balance.

I do my best to remain calm and try to tell her reassuring words but it seems like it falls on deaf ears. I can't redirect her or distract her like the resources I've been find online say as she only gets more worked up and tells me things like I'm faking being nice to her. I've also tried being in a different room than she is so she can calm down on her own, but she meanders and eventually finds me again and gets worked up. I've tried looking around for other tips but it's not for anything as drastic as her pushing me.

She's sick again and we're working on getting an appointment set up with her pcp ASAP. I don't mind so much that she's taking her frustrations out on me, granted I do get shaken up by it, but I just want her to be feeling better. Generally she's been very sweet since she got diagnosed with early onset three years ago so the sudden mood changes are quick to be noticed and the four of us, my dad, two sisters, and myself, work as fast as we can to give her care.","Does your county/city have palliative care?Palliative care has helped so much more with my dads mood issues that his primary care doctor. It might be worth it to see if they can help with your mom.

My wife’s anger and belligerence was out of control. Her psychologist prescribed three basic antipsychotics that really helped, for my wife Zoloft worked the best. But I started giving her more and more pills chasing good behavior. This led to a toxicity buildup in her system. The psychiatrist adjusted her program and it has worked fairly well up to this point. She is taking eight pills a day and she does everything she can to avoid taking them.",2022-04-06 08:24:10,Cabilope_B-K,txkye8
Alzheimers,"Thoughts on ""The Alzheimer's Solution"" by Drs. Sherzai?","This question was posed in 2017 and 2018 in this sub, but now that a bit more time has passed, I'm wondering if more people have read the book and tried the recommendations? I'm especially confused about how ""extreme"" of a diet do we need to follow? They advocate for a pretty extreme exclusion of all animal products, and then say ""but you don't have to be so extreme for it to work!"" Has anyone here tried these recommendations? 

About me: my partner's father was recently diagnosed, so we're doing research to help. And since  damage starts occurring in the brain starting in 30's / 40's, my partner and I want to make sure we follow a brain healthy lifestyle, given his family history. 

Thank you!!!","It’s not grounded in repeatable science. If it were, the disease would be in a different place. In other words, you can’t prove a causal relationship between the proposed diet and Alzheimer’s progression. It’s unfortunate, but anything that claims to solve or cure Alzheimer’s is unlikely to be real unless it’s brand new, and coming from a major medical institution or medical journal. It’s easy to cherry pick results that make an idea look good, but when you spread it at scale, it generally falls apart.
Sadly it is as horrible as Bredesen, Perlmutter, or Oz. Just a bunch of bullshit.
If you want a diet to help Alzheimer's, cut out as much processed oils (canola oil etc) and with it, fried foods as possible. The genetic link between alz and dementia is explicitly tied to the oxidative byproducts of fats (all kinds). However, processed fats have already undergone extreme amounts of oxidation in the refinement process, so much so that they have literally be ""deodorized"". Cooking at high temps with unstable fats is a major portion of the problem.

Contrary to your book, animal fats have been shown to be much more stable under high temperatures. However, some animal products, especially dairy have been shown to be highly inflammatory

Also, there seems to be some misinformation that the vast majority of alz cases are not genetically related. That is a lie. There are three classes of genetic variants of a fat transport protein in the brain (APOE). One group accounts for 20% of the population, but ~50% of cases (the susceptible variant). Another group 75% of the population, and accounts for ~50% (the baseline). The last group is 5% of the population, and account for ~1% of cases (protective variant). The differences are related to the protein's ability to detoxify the lipid oxidation byproducts.
Exercise, sleep well, heart healthy diet while knowing that it might not work.  Saved you many pages.",2022-04-05 21:40:26,HappyViolets,txasku
Alzheimers,Moving closer to the parent with Alzheimer's,"I have a parent who tells me they've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  My relationship with the parent has been trying for my entire life due to their mental illness and, I believe, extreme narcissism.  

Has anyone faced a similar quandary?  The issue I have is that I'm on my own and they're in one of the poorest states of the country, so, I'd be looking at some pretty limited options in terms of work and life, to say nothing of the fact that they've never really willingly been there since I graduated in terms of safety net or helping me in my career.  The parent has a partner but they're in their 80s so...","Honestly, and I may get tons of shit for this. I would suggest avoiding completely uprooting your life, career and future for a parent you are not close with, and harbor any amount of resentment towards.  It really will only lead to more resentment and mental stress. I honestly don't believe just bc you birthed a kid or two, that you're entitled to their time/effort and anguish..... especially if you were  a shit parent.  And taking care of a much loved relative w/ Alzheimer's is hard on the good days. 

I would see about taking family leave for as long as you can, in order to try and get a sense of what they have going on now/what she needs & how to set things up for management from afar. Get medical POA at minimum, switch all physician contact info to you, also look into financial POA if possible. (May be much harder w/ a spouse or partner involved) If she is still fairly self sufficient, I would try and find a facility that starts with assisted living, and has steps for future memory care.  (We wish we could have gotten my grandma into her facility sooner, when she was more ""with it"" she's always been very social, and if she had more time to adjust prior to decline, we think she would be more comfortable now) if you can get her set up where she's comfortable, and manage her care from afar I would, in your situation.  That or find a facility close to where you are now, and move her there for you.  If career prospects and everything is as bad as you say, I think avoiding it would be overall better.
They moved closer to me, a nearby city where 2 siblings live so I don't get the brunt of it. It's a lot of work, tons of paperwork and research as they decline. 

From my own experience, a rocky relationship gets worse. I have a really hard time fighting my own feelings and being kind when I just want to walk away. Maybe it'd be different if my mother liked me but who knows. 

If it's affordable this is the time to look into transitional living, independent to memory care. It can be complex, so much to factor in. 

Oh jeez I'm sorry to sound so negative! It's just a struggle I'm currently dealing with.
I have the opposite situation as you, my dad is the kindest, sweetest man I’ve ever known. He’s in an “apartment with help” (memory care) 10 minutes away which is centrally located between my siblings and I. And it can still be really stressful. 

My mother died suddenly in November 2020. I believe it was due to the stress of caregiving. She had heard of a statistic that 63% of all Alzheimer’s caregivers will die before the patient dies due to the stress. 

Add to that the narcissism of your parent and other mental health issues you’ve mentioned, and uprooting your life and moving to a place with limited career options sounds like a dream come true for a narcissistic parent and a nightmare for the child of a narcissist. 

Unless they’re willing to give you POA or move to “an apartment with help” I personally wouldn’t move there. If they expect you to move there and be their whipping boy/girl for the rest of their life I would make it clear it’s not happening. And then I would expect them to say what an awful son/daughter you are because that’s what narcissists do. 

I’m so sorry you have to go through this. Please keep us updated! I found a local support group for adult children of Alzheimer’s patients through alz.org. You may find that helpful as well.
Do not move there. If you have to be the primary caretaker, move them to you, or both of you move somewhere with max. options and support.
My family and I did exactly this about 1.5 years ago. Except we were just moving across the same state and moving to a bigger market, so for us, fortunately, there were plenty of upsides.
Don't give up your job and social network to become a caretaker to an aging narcissist.  You might hope to achieve a meaningful reconciliation with her. Nope, you'll simply get verbally abused..

Alzheimers,How do you cope?,"My dad is 50. I’m his primary caregiver, he has early onset Alzheimer’s and every day I see him get worse. He can’t remember what he’s doing, can’t remember names, he’s at a point where he’s asking the same questions every few minutes (‘where’s your mom and sister?’ At the dentist, rinse and repeat). Every day when I wake up I feel this gaping hole in my chest, and by the time I go to bed at night it’s so bad I can barely breathe from it.","Had to get therapy for it
Still working on this. End of last year my wife started asking me things that made it clear that at certain times, she didn't know who I am.  ""where do you live?"", ""how did we meet?"", etc.  Strangely it wasn't surprising, so I wasn't that upset.  But every day is a little worse: more uncertainty, more people and places gone.  This morning I woke up to ""sweetie, can you tell me where the bathroom is?"" (it is right next to the bed).  So coping is really, so far, just a matter of keeping perspective. She is safe, she isn't unhappy, save for anxious moments, and in theory, we have a support system and resources to keep it that way.  But how long I can delude myself thinking that each little decline requires only a little adjustment in my expectations, that I don't know.  I fear that one day, probably very soon, reality will hit. So, I dunno.  I think coping is a matter of letting go of how you want it to be and instead, knowing  what to expect. (and, of course, acting accordingly) 

^(not sure this is helpful. I think I just wanted to type this out to read it back to myself)
I try to remember simple is better. Simple answers, simple expectations and try to care for myself.

I help my mother with my dad, they live with my husband and myself. I vent regularly to my husband. But I also take antianxiety meds. In started then not long after my dad was diagnosed I did try to wean off them butt I got cancer and went back on. Lol. I'm not gonna try to function without them.

Make sure you get assistance. It can be a family member taking over for an evening or an side. You gotta take breaks, even if you do absolutely nothing during those breaks. You have to giver your brain a break. 

Eventually they will stop asking. It's mostly a slow process. My mother struggled with expecting my dad to still be able to do things and communicate but she adjusted.

Just remember to take care of yourself.
My dad got diagnosed at 61/62 for early onset but he was showing signs before that and let me tell you, coping is really hard. Try to put yourself in the mindset of ‘they cannot help it, they’re not trying to annoy you’ …being primary caregiver is a huge burden to carry so try to get as much external support as you can. My brothers and I would work from my parents’ house 1-2 days per week to take care of him while my mom worked, my aunts and uncles would all come by as often as possible to help too. He’s now in a nursing home at 66 because he couldn’t walk and my parents house was becoming a huge danger to him but we visit him every day and feel a little lighter knowing he’s in a place where they have the tools and machines to get him through the day.

Alzheimers,Alzeimer's and Dementia Care,,,2022-04-04 15:51:23,Ambitious_Pepper5224,twb8a5
Alzheimers,My father is displaying early signs of Alzheimers and is refusing to see a doctor,"My father (M, 70) has been confined to a wheelchair for about 15 years, and is reliant on help for even getting out of bed and going out and about. My mother (F, 61) is there to assist him, and we are lucky to be able to afford carers who tend to him. Recently, over the last few years, he has become noticably forgetful - from both small things, such as what day it is, what he had for lunch, or what time someone is supposed to come over, to other more things such as my brother's birthday, his cousin's name, whether people are dead or alive, etc.  Sometimes he will ask the same question 2 or 3 times during lunch or dinner, not realising that we have spoken about it already barely 5-10 minutes earlier. It has reached the stage where it is noticable even to people who don't live with him, but are meeting him socially.

The problem is - he is refusing to acknowledge these things happening. He either tries to laugh it off, claiming he was fooling us (he wasn't), or gets verbally combative, saying we're trying to trick him into thinking he's going mad. In one instance, even when on text message he mentioned something unfathomable, and we tried to show it to him as 'proof', asking him what he was trying to say, he just shuts up and shuts everyone else out. In his opinion, everything is as it should be.

But it is clearly not. Looking at early symptoms of alzheimer's, he is displaying a number of them: forgeting about recent conversations or events; forgeting the names of places and objects; asking questions repetitively; becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things.

But he refuses to see a doctor. We have tried speaking kindly, politely, begging, cajoling, pleading, being harsh, being reasonable - to no avail. He is convinced that we ""want to make him think he is mad"".

I really am not sure how I even proceed with this - I do not live in the same city as my parents, and I know that my mother is quite anxious about what the future holds. In her opinion, even if we just know what is happening, either way, at least it makes it easier to deal with - if a diagnosis can be confirmed, wouldn't it be better to start treating with medicines as early as possible? And if he is being this stubborn now, and he does indeed have Alzheimer's, what is it going to be like as it progressively gets worse? In the last month itself I have felt it get worse. 

Any advice is appreciated, both on how to approach my father and try to make him see a doctor, as well as how I can help my mother cope better with this. Thanks in advance!","you can't really treat it very effectively, so i wouldn't stress about getting a diagnosis, unless you expect you'll need it to get subsidized care or some other form of government help. 

does your father visit the doctor at all? my grandma got a mental ability test during a routine checkup at her usual general practice doctor. you do just a couple of things, doesn't take long and it's enough to get the papers. have your mother talk to the doctor beforehand about what's been happening. i would request that the doctor tells him what kind of test is being done, my grandma felt entrapped a bit, because it wasn't explained clearly to her. does he take pills as is now? it's just gonna be another one. 

it's more important to start figuring out how you'll deal with more and more advanced care your father will most likely need. can you mother handle it alone or should you start looking for help? do you have to enroll him in a home sooner rather than later because of waiting lines? best to be prepared. 

start educating yourself and your mom about the disease (and i mean dementia here as a broad umbrella term, i don't think a specific diagnosis is very useful in patients with gradual onset over a couple of years), it's more about coping with it for carers. you have to stop caring about repeating things and getting asked the same questions, takes a little practice to get used to it. 

for example, my grandma always has this one story about someone stealing her bed sheets (partly true story, partly i removed some when i moved in with her). i stopped convincing her that it didn't happen, i just listen to her, confirm that stealing is horrible and that a bad thing did indeed happen to her, but that she is safe now. that way we both remain calm and move on with our day.

the patients usually don't really know what's going on anyway (my grandma doesn't really remember, that she doesn't remember, if that makes sense). you gain nothing (i'd argue that you often end up achieving the opposite, just causing stress to both parties) by making your father admit he has memory issues, because he'll forget about it anyways and you'll be doing it all over again the next day.
I'm sorry you're going through this. I've been going through this too, and it is probably the hardest part of the condition... the fact that they can no longer be reasoned with because reason doesn't get through.

There's an account that I follow on Instagram (I am in no way affiliated with them, it's just been a really helpful account) that posted something recently. It said, ""Dementia is not an ask for permission disease."" [https://www.instagram.com/p/CbxVGFSMMkN/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbxVGFSMMkN/)

What it means is, they're never going to agree, because they no longer have the ability to judge scenarios accurately. Which means someone else will have to decide for them. Complete autonomy only works in scenarios where someone is not cognitively compromised. I'm so sorry, I hope you're able to figure things out soon. I am with you, getting a diagnosis does help in a number of ways, so I'd try to get one as soon as possible.
When my dad was at a stage that it sounds like your dad was at, he was already out of it enough that we could lie or just not tell him we were taking him to a doc. 

I think we booked the appointment (you could explain to the docs office what was going on so they'd be ready for complications or resistance) and we might have told him but he forgot. Then on the 30 minute trip there, im pretty sure we told him we were going to the bank, or for a doctor appointment for me, or going shopping. He was asking multiple times so we just said whatever to get him to cooperate. 

He sure wasn't comprehending the appointment was a neurologist for him. When in the docs office he was annoyed with the doc, and offended at being asked the ""stupid questions"" that ""of course he knew"" but couldn't answer. He didn't seem to remember the different lies we told him to get him there, so he wasn't outraged at being lied to. Was angry and difficult, but in an Alzheimer's way not a ""you assholes lied to me and im pissed"" way like a normal person. 

And thats how we got him his preliminary diagnosis and how we got him to all the other follow up appointments. 

This really works depending on how long they can retain a convo for tho. If your dad remembers a convo from yesterday, it might not work. If he cant retain for an hour, maybe? The trip itself might make him temporarily ""worse"" too, because there will be stuff going on to distract him.  You could try taking him on an actual nice short day out and see how long he retains things from point to point. 

Alternatively maybe you could luck out and find a doc who makes house calls? 

I do encourage you to try tho, mainly because of the chance that its *not* Alzheimer's and is something treatable or even reversible. A lot of things can cause dementia and they need to be ruled out.  Sometimes, the earlier you catch a cause, the better the outcome too.
Sorry about your situation (mine isn’t too different). One thing, has you or your mom looked into long-term memory care insurance? We just learned about this, but you can only get it before the insured person has been diagnosed with anything (with a broad definition of ‘diagnosed’). It might cost a bit now, but might really help you and your family in the long run.
My husband does not  like to go to the doctor either. It’s probably best to make the appointment and not tell him until the day of. its not worth arguing with someone who has dementia , if he does have it.   You could tell the doc about your concerns before hand and then tell your dad its just a routine check up . The doctor will just ask a few questions and judge his response. You can lie  to your dad about the reason for the appointment, if he asks .  Also people who have it try to hide it at first and some don’t realize they have it . They may have anosognosia. That’s when  part of your brain does not know you have an issue. Good luck . I  think I  know what you are going through.
Oh my, the part where you say “we have tried speaking kindly, politely, begging, cajoling, pleading..”.  That was me for the last 2 years with my dad. Someone advised my to approach it from a place of “This is something that worries me…” and for some reason that was magic. Sort of. Two weeks later he had a referral for a senior eval. I accompanied him to the appt. And he scored a 22/30 on their exam recommended additional follow up, therapy etc. 

He wants non of that. Wouldn’t even commit to scheduling a re-exam in 12 months. So.. baby steps, I guess. Now I work on follow up and recommended action (is his house safe to age in place, etc).",2022-04-04 12:14:42,throwaway040422_,tw5x9i
Alzheimers,Virtual Support Group for Dementia Family Caregivers,"Hey there, I've been following this sub for a while and I really appreciate that it exists.

My grandma - who means the whole world to me - was diagnosed with PCA/Benson's Syndrome (a rare, visual variant of Alzheimer's) two years ago. But her health has drastically deteriorated in the past month. She’s been experiencing visual hallucinations and environmental unfamiliarity.

In addition to this being hard for her, it’s been really hard for me to witness it all. I’m not her primary caregiver but I check up on her every other day and make sure to cheer her up. But sometimes the situation gets to me and I feel very defeated.

We live in Armenia where resources/awareness are very limited, so I’m hoping to engage directly with people who understand what I’m going through. Ideally, I want to find or create a virtual support group for people who have a family member with PCA or dementia in general.

Any words of encouragement or advice will be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance.","I’m so sorry, hun… I’m all in for a support group, maybe on telegram?
I'll join as well.

Alzheimers,My mom's dog died and she keeps forgetting and can't stop crying. Suggestions?,,"It’s important to not remind her of the dog’s death if she asks where the dog is. When this happened to my dad, we always made up some excuse like the dog was at the vet or getting groomed. We also got him a stuffed dog and referred to that as his dog when he repeatedly asked. After a while, he forgot about the dog.
Sometimes it is best to fib for her comfort. You can say she went to the groomers.
Nobody in this situation will get anything out of the truth, so just give an excuse and then redirect the conversation and get her onto a different track. The excuse doesn’t even need to be a good one since she won’t remember it anyway.
Stop telling her the truth. It only hurts her every time. Say the dog is out for a walk, or the vet, or at the dog park. Redirect the conversation. You are only saving her from pain by lying. It is the kindest thing you can do.
Sorry to hear. My first suggestion is: give it time because sad to say, she may forget about her dog or forget how important it was to her.

When my mom’s beloved cat passed away she kept forgetting too and would get sad every time. She loved that cat sooo much I didn’t think she’d ever get over it - I even encouraged her to get another cat and she refused. 

Now she barely remembers the cat at all. She has pictures of him and sometimes she says what a great cat he was, but most of the time I don’t think she is clear on how much she loved it so it doesn’t bother her anymore. Also, I have a cat now and she focuses on him now. 

So my 2nd suggestion would be to get her a new dog to help her focus on that, but only if there is someone living with her that can make sure the dog gets fed and walked in case she forgets to.
It won't stop. My dad had a stroke and died after a brain tumor was found. When my mom would ask where he was, I'd choke up and she'd see my reaction and question me even more. It was just something I learned to deal with as best I could.",2022-04-03 19:43:21,Tomomori79,tvnihz

Alzheimers,How was your loved one diagnosed?,"My dad received his diagnosis during COVID. He had a virtual 2-session “interview” with a neuro-psychologist from the neurologist’s office. Granted, the MRI/CT did show some atrophy as well, but the actual diagnosis came after this virtual meeting. My dad is 70, isn’t the most social person, and isn’t used to virtual appointments. The whole thing didn’t go well. Nonetheless, we toughed through.

Her findings were that he presents with Alzheimer’s and General Anxiety. And that was that.

Just curious how else someone gets formally diagnosed.","I'm a psychologist who diagnoses people with dementia. The GP refers them to us. 

We test their cognitive abilities (2h assignment) and talk to the family+client (1h). The testscores then get compared to people in their age and education bracket. The dementia diagnosis is usually quite clear from that. 

This may sound like it's too vague, but you can look up the MMSE to get a sense of these types of tests. Keep in mind that a score below 25 means something is definitely wrong, as the test is so easy that regular, healthy people should make it flawlessly. Being unable to do simple math, remember 3 words, or know what season we're in says a lot about their minds already. This gets combined with the information from the family: can't remember appointments, unlearned how to work the TV, needs help with finances these days, confabulating stories, etc. All of these are outside the norms for normal ageing. 

I'm not sure I made a comprehensive or coherent response, feel free to ask for clarification.
My dad was diagnosed with probable Alzheimers, I believe in 2019, after an in person visit with a neurologist who specializes in cognitive decline. I know it involved an MRI and I'm pretty sure it involved blood work.
IMO atrophy on an MRI/CT is how the neurologist made the diagnosis. The FaceTime meetings were just to confirm he had the symptoms. I am not an expert, I just have my wife’s situation to base my opinion on.

I started trying to get my wife diagnosed when she was 55. The neurologist said it was not likely she had dementia based on her age. In addition to the ungodly number of tests and appointments with specialists, she had three or four MRI/CT scans. They all came back negative. I have been told it is very difficult to detect early stage dementia with an MRI/CT scan.

Finally the results from a radiated glucose PET/CT scan was interpreted for Lewy bodies. A couple years later based upon her behavior the neurologist changed her diagnosis to FTD.
My mother was diagnosed last year (the 1-year mark should pass any day now), about a month before I turned 19. I think they used spinal fluid. I’d had my suspicions of it since I was around 15-16, but getting the diagnosis and having my fears confirmed was like having a brick thrown at me. 

Sorry to hear about your father. ♡
My mom was diagnosed after about 2 years of no
Pricing some mild symptoms (being forgetful, having trouble keeping up with conversations). It was June of 2020 when she got her initial MCI diagnosis. We get her reevaluated this year and got mild Alzheimer’s diagnosis which is what we were expecting. She currently cannot complete instrumental tasks without assistance (cooking, cleaning, filling pills, some driving)
If progressed enough, Alzheimer's can be fairly easy to diagnose and would not require more than an initial meeting.

That said, I don't put much stock into telehealth/virtual neuropsych evaluations when it comes very early stage symptoms; especially in those of an age that are completely unfamiliar with the concept of virtual doctor visits and videocalls.
Late last spring my father had a UTI. He's 82 now. While they were treating the UTI he just shut down. Was stiff as a board for about a month in the hospital until they brought out other neurologists. In the process of trying to figure out what was going on (turns out Parkinson's), they discovered that he does have Alzheimers.

Alzheimers,Early onset Alzheimer’s runs in my family…I’m 35 and have been taking Unisom for the past 2 years…I’ve noticed mild memory issues. Research and Unisom is an anticholinergic which is linked to dementia risk (please read below as I’ve met the 300 character quota).,,"Early onset Alzheimer’s runs in my family…I’m 35 and have been taking Unisom for the past 2 years…I’ve noticed not being able to remember if I fed my dog or not lately as well as cannot recall certain words (more than feels “normal.”) doing research and Unisom is an anticholinergic which is linked to dementia risk…I want to go talk to a neurologist. Has anyone gotten tested for the genes that cause early onset Alzheimer’s? Trying to do all the research I can and of course very worried if I myself will get this terrible disease.
Wtf. I'm pregnant and the one thing they recommend to sleep at night is Unisom. 

Why are people pushing these drugs if they have dementia risks?
I was taking Kirkland Sleep Aid (doxylamine succinate, same ingredient as Unisom I think) which is considered to increase dementia risk. I stopped taking it and now I sleep like shit again, which is also linked to Alzheimer's risk. And yes, I have a copy of the late-onset gene. Not sure what to do over here. I exercise like mad to try to make myself sleep, including cardio and weights, but I wake at 2 am every fucking morning.
Look into the DIAN network they have great resources. It’s for Dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s and they have great resources for family members that are concerned they might have inherited it as well as studies and genetic counseling and forums on it. Might not be helpful for your specific case but it was for me and my brother as early onset Alzheimer’s has been in my family for a few generations.
i think you should definitely talk to a neurologist. honestly, low chance but, might have a legal case against unisom if you suffered real harm from their product.
Medications like Unisom( anticholinergic antihistamines) do worsen cognition in the elderly/dementia patients but it is unlikely that it actually contributes to or causes the disease itself. 

The data suggesting there is a causal link also included anti-depressants, anti-parkinsons drugs, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and so on and ranged from 55-year-olds to 100-year-olds.  The 50+% dementia risk claimed is really talking about those other very powerful drugs and their anticholinergic properties are minimal, tbh.  The other aspects of those drugs are likely what is damaging.  

The antihistamines (like Unisom) showed a much lower risk profile (2% risk between 366-1095 TSDDs and 14% increase risk if taken over 1095 TSDDs) (TSDD is total standardized daily dose but I'm not totally sure how this was calculated) though that's still certainly not nothing.  The 12% difference in these numbers seems in line with the average % of dementia onsets within the age group studied and may just be circumstantial with the aging population.  

The study showed that antipsychotics have a 70% increased risk of dementia (interestingly 109% increase at lower dose) but this is misleading because the anticholinergic properties of anti-psychotics are minimal and likely unrelated.

edit: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2736353  Here is the study if you would like to check it out. Table 5 is most useful.

""A total standardized daily dose (TSDD) was calculated for each patient with a validated assessment based on strength, daily dose, and length of use for each of 56 drugs with anticholinergic properties.""
I just went through cognitive testing at my neurologist’s recommendation and they discovered I have EOA.  I have other issues that led to the testing but the word searching/aphasia has been going on for over a year or so.  The testing is LONG, a full day’s worth, it’s exhausting, but it was worth it to know where I stood.

Alzheimers,Need help getting treatment,"Any ideas appreciated! This month I (clinical researcher and prior MRI training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family). 

It began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed TIA?). Since then, she’s been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. PCP told her to follow up in a year! I told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then I read through all the reports: MRI shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says “Alzheimer’s”.  

BUT she was ultimately diagnosed as “mild neurological disorder” and won’t get meds until she becomes severe. My friend said he was told there’s nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so I’ve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. What else can be done for her that I’m missing?? Thank you!!","I’m in UK so it’s probably different but even now my dad is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s rather than MCI which is all they’d say initially, it hasn’t unlocked anything. 
The only thing he is prescribed is anti depressants. 
AFAIK there are meds which may slow decline but certainly won’t reverse it, and it’s unfortunately a disease with an inevitable decline. 

I’d suggest as an initial port of call too to start looking in to practical things like Power of attorney, sorting financial affairs, looking at what support there will be for carers in home and out of home when the time comes
The current approach to Alzheimer’s (imo) is shameful. Bureaucracy will close the door to alternative approaches and then make you feel stupid for asking.
Whoa, I thought Alzheimer's drugs including memantine and donepezil are most effective in early stages!  Behavioral interventions are probably more important: adequate nutrition, social contact, fall prevention, things like that.  If she's living at home, she's probably endangered.  You don't mention where you are or what kind of funding.  That is helpful in giving advice.
Id suggest a second or even third opinion. If they are in the US and paying health insurance may as well use that mofo to the fullest.",2022-03-31 22:47:53,Puzzlehead_Rest_18,ttgget
Alzheimers,Being possessive of animal not hers,Need help please. My daughter is visiting for a long period with her dog. My mother keeps saying it’s ‘her’ dog and gets mad when my daughter takes her dog for a walk or feeds her. Mom keeping getting upset and telling everyone to leave ‘her’ dog along. Anyone else have this issue? Thanks so much.,"Have you considered getting your mother a stuffed animal dog? Maybe one that’s the same color as your daughters dog, if you can. That’s what worked with my mom, we got her the joy for all robotic cat that purrs and meows and everything and she’s as happy as a clam. They also make a dog version I believe.
Is it possible to have something to distract her when your daughter goes out for walks and move the dogs food bowls somewhere that mom doesn't go often?

This disease is frustrating because so often there are no solutions outside of redirection or changing our own behavior
We're starting to have this issue with my sister's cat. We live at home with our dad to take care of our mom and lately mom has been claiming the cat is hers and gets authoritative over it whenever we take actual care of it. Mom misreads its body language frequently so it's difficult to address her behavior and the cat's at the same time.

She has her own stuffed dog and absolutely loves it but chooses the live cat whenever both are in the same room. I usually end up hovering nearby to supervise that their interactions are safe for both but that tends to agitate mom and gets more protective of the cat.

How is your mom's balance? If she's able to walk much and the dog's properly leashed trained, maybe see if going out on walks together with your daughter might help?  If that's not an option, perhaps keeping the dog and mom separate and out of eye sight during feeding and walking time might work. Or ask your daughter to have someone else watch the dog.

Try not to tell your mom that it's not her dog as that will only make her more defensive. If she starts to get super possessive, maybe the dog should be kept somewhere else close while your daughter visits and can take care of her pet without your mom being upset.
I was going to suggest a robotic animal but seems it's already been suggested.  I know some patients do well with baby dolls too.",2022-03-31 20:54:38,purplechicken3031,tteceb
Alzheimers,Visiting someone with recently diagnosed with Alzheimers and Dementia after 12 years of no contact,"So, it’s a bit of a mess of a story, but my paternal grandfather was recently admitted to a facility because of Dementia, and his kidneys have begun to fail so he doesn’t have much time left. I am currently 22, and I haven’t seen or heard from him since around 2010 due to my dad making the decision to cut contact with him due to other mental health problems of his to keep both of us safe.

In his final moments, I do really want to be there for him; and my father has successfully been able to do so himself. So far, I’ve only seen him once, and seeing how far gone he was, being nearly nonverbal at this point, absolutely crushed me. Last I remembered him he was healthy and full of life still, and I’m still shocked and tearing up over it.

I have mental health problems myself, and they of course have gotten a lot worse since these developments. I feel selfish because I know how much being visited means to him right now, but all I do is freeze and lose the ability to speak when in the room with him, and then begin drinking heavily for the rest of the day after that.

I’m hoping anyone out there has any suggestions or insight on the best course of action. Should I try harder to suck it up and be there for him, both so he’s less alone, and so that I won’t feel like I didn’t do enough after he’s gone? Or maybe I should stay away since it’s so high stress on my end and for the people around me worrying about my addiction problems coming back, and I’ll just have the pleasant memories of all the things we used to do together when I was really little. I don’t know him very well anymore but from how I used to know him, I believe he would want me to only remember him as he was when I was little.

Thank you for reading, I know how awful dementia is, and I’ve handled it before, but its completely different when it’s family.","If you’re grandfather has dementia, and is non-verbal, the likelihood of him recognizing you is very, very low. I’m very worried about your stress levels. It’s not worth it if your sobriety is at risk. Could you honor your grandfather in some other way, that would not risk your sobriety? If there is a funeral, they will need memory boards. Could you work on the memory boards? Get black tri-fold poster boards at a craft store, and put pictures of your Grandfather in better days on it? 

If you do decide to go, don’t stress about talking. It’s very difficult to have a one-way conversation with someone in his condition. You could read to him, or bring some lotion and put rub some into his hands and onto his feet. That is very soothing. You could hum a song while doing it. If you talk, he’s not likely to be able to follow your words. 

You could tell him in a soothing, gentle voice about your favorite memories you have of him. This would be as much for him as it is for you. 

If you can picture doing these things for him, without your stress levels going up, then maybe you can do it. 

If picturing this makes you anxious, I feel that it is not safe for you to do it. 

Your grandfather would not want you to risk your sobriety for this. 

Good luck, and please keep us posted.
Could you try going with your dad? Might help take some of the pressure off. 

Also, maybe try not having high expectations when you go. Just sitting there with him is more than enough. Turn the tv on, read a book. I’m sure you’re presence is all he needs. Maybe build up to the small talk once you’ve sat there for a little while.

You also don’t have to stay long. Whatever you can endure is fine.
Prioritize your own mental health.  

My observation from being a long-time depression sufferer and father of a recovering addict is that there is no such thing as “sucking it up”.  If you are coping after a visit with him by drinking heavily for the rest of the day, you are damaging yourself.  You have a responsibility to yourself and the people around you to keep yourself physically and mentally healthy.

If your grandfather can still read or has someone who can read to him, you might consider sending a note or card instead of some visits.  You want to let him know that he is loved, and you can do it this way.  It’s probably better - for him and for you - than physically being present but not being mentally or emotionally present when visiting him.
As someone who lives with liver disease, I want you prioritize your own health during this difficult time. I understand it’s hard; my step mother is dealing with dementia herself.

No one wants to hear about how alcohol affects your health; most people know already. The problem is that, there are no warning signs. You won’t feel any symptoms until it’s already too late. The liver is a miraculous organ that helps to regulate hundreds of functions in the body. Many don’t realize that the damaged liver itself isn’t always the problem, but instead causes all kinds of other health issues in the body as a result of being diseased. If the disease progresses far enough to cause scarring (cirrhosis), there’s no undoing the damage. It will shorten your life, and you’ll spend that time with significant health issues. You’re much too young to be dealing with that, and it’s something your grandfather doesn’t want for you. No one around you does. So please take care of yourself during this difficult time.
If you absolutely have to see your grandfather and risk your sobriety over it, consider having a buddy that doesn't drink and who you trust to stay with you before, during, and for some time after your visit.

You could maybe also ask the people who tend to him if there's anything he'd like/need that you could send them? Not sure how applicable that would be, but it might be worth it if you could help him and not risk your well-being simultaneously.",2022-03-31 16:50:38,boostarte,tt9eum
Alzheimers,Need Advise: parent(s) misplacing things,"One of my parents has been leaving salt and pepper shakers in the microwave a few times and (from what I can tell) not thinking it was them who did it.

If they catch on, or you don’t want to hide what you’re doing, tell them. Tell them you cannot have your grandmas death, or the death of anyone else, on your conscience because of their negligence. 

As a mom with a toddler, this scares the hell out of me. Would you rather have a mad grandpa and aunt on your hands, or a dead child? Maybe I went to worst case scenario, but it happens. Remember almost all “accidents” are preventable. 

I used to drive my grandma anywhere, any time I could to stop her from driving. Maybe try to set a schedule so everyone can get grandma where she needs to go. 

Be prepared for people like my shit uncle, who said, it’s not that I can’t help, I choose not to. 

Thanks for caring so much, you’re a good person.
What you can do may vary by your state. You can check your state's DMV to see who reports of a medically impaired driver may come from, but in general it would be a doctor or law enforcement. It looks like law enforcement didn't file on this one, but if you know her doctor you can reach out to them--at a distance, sending a print letter might be the best thing to do. HIPAA won't allow them to tell you what, if any, action they take but it doesn't prevent you from giving information to them. I'd keep the message short and succinct with as much supporting detail as you know.
In the state of NY, when my dad had his accident and the paramedics/hospital recognized he had a cognitive issue, they filed it with the Police and DMV. He was forced to take a road exam with an Occupational Therapist who works with the Motor Vehicles agency. Only he could pass/fail my dad. Removed a lot of the pressure from us on deciding if dad could drive again. He needs to go back every 6 months. See if your state has something like this. 

Now my dad has lost all interest in driving. Go figure….
We had my mom evaluated by an occupational therapist who specializes in driving evaluations for dementia and Alzheimer’s patients.  It was well worth the peace of mind. Plus it makes them the bad guy, not us, when they do eventually take her license away.
You may want to mention, that because of her DX, and now a history of not being capable behind the wheel, your grandfather (or anyone who may have POA) could be held liable for any damages/injuries in any future accidents...
Try and convince her to stop driving and get other family members on board. Tell her she could kill someone.  It’s not just herself that she should be concerned about. Offer to teach her how to use Uber.
Report her to the state DMV.  They'll take her license away.",2022-03-31 09:10:41,butterscotchgamer,tszf6w
Alzheimers,Neurodegenerative drug development summit + current state of Alzheimer's research,"For those of you interested in the science of treating Alzheimer's, there was a multi-day conference over the past few days where a lot of companies laid out how they've been approaching these different neurodegenerative diseases.  [https://neurodegenerative-drug-development.com/](https://neurodegenerative-drug-development.com/)

So far, Biogen has a product that passed FDA trials for treatment of Alzheimer's called Aduhelm.  It was initially listed at $56,000 for a year's worth of medication which was a staggering amount of money.  This was a obviously a real downer because I was initially excited to hear Biogen get the nod from the FDA until I heard about the price.  If anyone has experience with it, I'd be interested to hear about it.  It was somewhat good to hear that there weren't many takers at that price so it sounds like they'll be reducing the price by 50%.

What's great though is that time is running out on them being the only treatment.  It turns out that there are actually a lot of other companies that want a chance to perform trials and get something to market which will likely reduce the price and the possibility that one of these companies will knock it out of the park and for a reasonable price.

Merck had one get to phase 3 trials, but wasn't able to pass.  I believe they're still working on it.  I think there are other big pharma projects as well.","The cruddy thing about the Biogen drug is it did not actually show cognitive improvement in the participants, rather it showed that it can clear amyloid which they think can slow progression. Also, there was practically no diversity in the trials. It’s a little nuts.

While we wait for a drug that is a cure, there are great programs to help people with the symptoms they have. For example movement programs can help. This is a great one sponsored by NIA https://togetherseniorhealth.com/current-research-study-rp
Not trying to imply support for or against, but if you wanted to get involved in trying to lower the cost of aduhelm, the Alzheimer's Association has been trying to get it accessible to all for a while: https://www.alz.org/news/2021/change-of-aduhelm-price-by-biogen-is-only-a-step-t

You could see if there is an Alzheimer's association near you, especially their local advocacy activity. In my state they have us talking to lawmakers to push local and, if you want, national issues like aduhelm pricing, and using social media or whatever you're comfortable with. 

Science moves slow...its the nature of science. ..and legislation can be slow too, but advocacy is one way us ordinary folks can speed some types of help along.",2022-03-31 10:09:08,TopTierTuna,tt0l7z
Alzheimers,Hospital recommends nursing home for my dad. Do I tell him?,"My dad (78)is in the hospital as he has quickly advancing Alzheimer’s and he wasn’t eating or drinking enough. It is no longer a medical emergency ( it was)but he’s still not getting around like he was or taking in as much food as he should.
Also he’s confused and Sun Downing.
My mom can’t take care of him.
Problem is a few months ago he was so healthy and active and still driving etc.
It was a huge quick decline😔.
They are recommending a home.
When I visit he constantly says he’s doing better and eating, doing his physical therapy etc etc.
He’s asking why he’s still there and wants to be discharged.
I haven’t told him yet but keep saying “ just a bit longer” and “ once you get your strength back”.
Or I play dumb like I don’t know either.
At some point very soon the staff will tell him.
How do I handle? Do I just hope he immediately forgets that conversation when it happens?
Help!
TIA","In general, the recommendation is no, don't tell the person with dementia--it would usually be more for the person telling to feel better than for the person with dementia. If you think he's going to forget immediately, what's your goal in telling? 

""Just a bit longer when you get more strength back"" sounds like a fine answer in the meantime. When it comes time for him to move, some people frame the move to memory care as ""your doctor wants you to be in a special rehab until you improve more,"" but that's a case by case thing.
We told my dad the house needed construction work and it was dangerous so he had to stay at the home. We never used the words memory care or nursing home and acted like it was a hotel or apartment. 

He's been there about a month and has stopped asking to go home.
Quick decline sometimes means UTI. Some doctors can remember stuff but aren't critical thinkers. Did they check?
You first response is fine. Morally, I think keeping the present pleasant and positive is the way to go. I'm caring for my Father who has Alzheimer's and as much as my brain has conflict with white lies my priority is his immediate comfort. His ability to grasp concepts are declining so keeping things simple is important. Best of luck to you, it's a journey that's for sure.
Sorry for your situation, it does suck. Don't know what your folks money situation is like, cause every option is costly. Is there any possibility of getting your Mom some assistance and keeping him at home. Wish there were good options, but there really are not. My Mom has been in memory care for years and while it is necessary, it's horrible. If you dad is still somewhat functional he will probably be very unhappy. Good luck, and prayers for you and your family.
no chance of any younger relatives to move in with them?
If he truly was intact a few months ago then something else is going on.  Alzheimer's disease does not advance remotely that quickly.  Has he had a proper work up from a neurologist?  I would assume they checked for UTI?  UTI's are notorious for causing complete delirium in elderly patients and can mimic a fast progressing dementia, however most of the time the patient returns to baseline after some time has passed and it has been fully treated. 

Other possibilities would include Nmda encephalitis and other autoimmune encephalitis diseases which can progress rapidly.  

The most common finding though is that the patient has been declining for years but it just went unnoticed because people are so used to covering for them until they're unable to do more simple things.

If he hasn't had a proper neurological workup that's what I would recommend.  As far as the nursing home, I can't imagine it will go well if he just shows up at a nursing home and no one told him he was going there.  It really depends on how well he would probably tolerate that news.  But I have seen families just bring their loved one to a nursing home that they never knew they were going to and he became so combative that he was kicked out of the nursing home fairly quickly.   I also recommend a very deep research into the nursing homes available as most of them have pretty shady reputations.
By any chance did he experience a stroke? My grandmother on my dad’s side (both my grandmothers had Alzheimer’s) had a stroke which led to her rapid decline. She actually was not able to verbally communicate anymore after that. I would tell him what is going on and get his doctor’s recommendation as to what the next steps should be. If you can and if you have the support for it, I would suggest bringing him home to be cared by family. We did that with my maternal grandmother for 7 years.",2022-03-31 07:22:10,stamm74,tsxk27

At this point, the incontinence issue is probably worse than the ALZ, since he is in fairly early stages of it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!","Routine helps a lot. After a meal, have him go to the bathroom. Every two or three hours, have him go to the bathroom as well.

We got Depends for my mom. She does remember to go to the toilet sometimes - but sometimes it just comes out. And the Depends are a LOT easier than cleaning up the mess, especially because she doesn't always realize she's made one. 

On the other hand, we do still have to make sure she throws the Depend away when she's done, and doesn't try to rewear it. She's also tried to wash them in the sink and in the washing machine (they get really big!) and tried to dry them in the dryer. And sometimes she will put regular underwear underneath them. But it's still better than no diaper at all.
One thing that seems to help my mid-stage partner: reminders. She apparently recognizes the urge, but sometimes simply forgets the urge is present. Sometimes the sound of my using the bathroom is also a prompt.

It sounds ridiculous, but just askng ""do you have to use the toilet"" may be able to break into the zone-out and get action started. 

Of course, then it's on you not to be absent-minded.
I increased the nightlight level in the bathrooms. That helped my partner's ability to use the bathroom at night.
My advice is to talk about this straightforwardly and buy him some disposable briefs.
Unfortunately it'll slowly get worse, at some point it'll need diapers for both #1 and #2. Constant reminders and a schedule help so you catch it before it happens. At some point they'll start missing the toilet even if they try to go, soil their clothes and not notice and walk around your house sitting on everything
My mother in law developed double incontinence at the mid-AD stage - the part of her brain that tells her she needs to go to the toilet has been affected (common in AD).



We tried taking her to the toilet more often but she was v reluctant and resistant. It got to the point where we had to get adult pull-ups. In the UK you can get them for free if your GP refers you to the Continence Clinic. I don't know where in the world you are, but perhaps there's a similar scheme you could utilise? 



As an aside, elderly people are more prone to UTIs, and they have a huge effect on dementia patients (my MIL would become more aggressive/violent, paranoid, even forgot how to walk) - it's worth testing weekly (I bought the UTI strips from Amazon).



Wishing you the best of luck on this journey.
Yep. My mom would go in her pants while she was walking around. It literally didn’t occur to her. That was 9 months ago. She’s had a couple of minor TIAs since then and seizures that robbed her of her speech and mobility. Got the call today that she had another stroke and prob won’t last much longer. In the car heading to see her before it’s too late. Disease sucks
Father has the same issue, but his incontinence is due to the meds he's on.

I live in a different country to my parents, so the only solution we've found is diapers ...
Dad is on the more affected end of the Alzheimer’s spectrum and has a prostate issue. Continence garments are a must at this point. Routine is key until it doesn’t make an impact.
If he is taking any anticholinergic medications for his incontinence it would exacerbate his dementia.  Typical ones are oxybutynin, detral, and toviaz

Myrbetriq is the only incontinence medication recommended for dementia patients since it is not anticholinergic.  A condom catheter is another option and of course Depends.

Incontinence is usually pretty tough to treat in dementia.

Also be on the look out for doctors trying to label him with normal pressure hydrocephalus with his incontinence  It is commonly misdiagnosed in the Alzheimer's population.
Routine can help. Diapers too, but call it briefs so they feel less demoralized. A foley may be another option but that increase the risks of an UTI.
Mum is incontinent and it started off slowly. She had some sort of episode the day before she went into hospital (never found out what - we thought it was a stroke, but wasn't) and from that day onwards she was urine incontinent 24/7. She doesn't get any sense of an urge until right before but by the time she stands up it's too late.  Adult diapers are now the norm for my mum. It is very distressing for her as she is still aware enough to realise, but not understanding enough to know that it can't be fixed. Very sad. Sorry you're going through this with your dad, too.
Forty years of dealing with Alzheimer's, yes. I see my comment has been down voted. That's OK, it's a natural reaction to something people do not like to hear. But, the fact is that out of control infections are the result negligence on the part of so-called ""caregivers."" I understand that it is hard to continually take your parent to the the hospital, but there is no answer on Reddit that solves that. You cannot absolve your responsibility with a post on Reddit.
Chronic infection is a sign of negligence.
Incontinence is usually due to infection in Alzheimer's patients.",2022-03-30 10:57:03,Alexstarr718,ts8ask
Alzheimers,"Mom is finally at peace , but it still hurts","Mom (91) passed last night. It came on quick. I live out of state and wasn’t able to see her the last three years. she had vascular dementia and had gotten to the stage where I couldn’t talk on the phone with her. I  prayed she would pass easily one day. Still  it was unexpected. I didn’t know she was taken to the hospital until she was gone. I was hoping I would get to see her one more time . . And what really sucks , is my husband has Alzheimer’s and I can’t travel with him. He isn’t ready for a home yet. But he is  delusional  at times . Last time I drove  long distance with him he tried to  find something to cut the seatbelt and he opened the car door while I was driving on the interstate.  So going to moms funeral is out of the question. I don’t dare fly with him . We would probably kicked off the plane. I would love to have some closure. I’m not really asking for advice or sympathy. Just putting it out there because AD sucks. So I’ve been  talking to mom and letting her know how much she has meant to me and all the things I wish I could have talked to her about the last 8 years. Before she was afflicted. I hope she can hear me. I love you mom .  And fuck you dementia.

&#x200B;

I want to thank all of you for your kind remarks . my sympathies go out  for those who have also lost someone. WE are all dealing with this everyday and I hope you all have bright moments and find your own little space of calm and peace .","I’m so sorry for your loss, I hope that peace and closure find you in other ways ♥️
I lost mom last Tuesday morning to AD.  She had stopped eating and drinking for weeks + she slept almost 24 hours a day.

I wanted to hear mom say “I love you son” one more time.  I wanted her to say it BUT I wanted her to mean it too.  Didn’t happen.  She was gone mentally for about a year.

She didn’t say what I needed to hear BUT I know she felt that way.  So, I’m good.
So sorry for you. You are not alone. I’m sure she’s cheering you on right now. A mom couldn’t do anything less.
Fuck dementia, my mom is 61 and has early onset Alzheimer's. I'm afraid to lose it the day she will leave. I feel your pain
I'm sorry for your loss and your inability to grieve the normal way (with support of others and comforting funerary process).  Just remember she lives in you every day.  Sorry about your husband too, I'm dealing with that myself right now and wouldn't even consider traveling with him.  May you find peace.
This is so heartbreaking.
Wishing you gentle moments.",2022-03-29 22:00:27,Lollipoplou,trvmyj
Alzheimers,Problematic caretakers,"My dad has dementia and is going to need full-time help soon enough. (Driving, shopping, etc.) My mother is a half-functioning alcoholic (half the time sober and amazing, half the time binge drinking/in bed.) I wouldn't say they are in denial but they are 100% wanting to kick the decision down the road and don't seem motivated to face it. How would you deal with this situation? I live several hours away.","Plan a visit with them. Prepare for a very difficult but necessary conversation about BOTH of their end-of-life care. tell your mom in advance you plan to discuss this during your visit and ask if she can dig up a copy of her will if she has one, and if she would be willing to “get some things squared away” with you “just in case”. Or if you dont think she’d take it well, dont mention it but it may make it easier if she is prepared as well for the discussion. 

Ask her when she would like help caring for your father. not *if* but *when*. at what point will she not want to be his only caretaker? when he starts to wander out of the house? when he nearly has (or does have) a bad accident in the kitchen? discuss finances available for that care. maybe there is a neighbor or a friend that can stop in for a couple hours a day to watch your dad and do a couple of chores for her, and care could ramp up from there as he progresses. 

Discuss their wills and ensure they have everything they want in the way they want it. Discuss medical proxy, and possibly be prepared to draw up forms to make you the primary person to make decisions on your mother’s behalf in an emergency, rather than your father. 

Discuss what your mother would like the later years of her life to look like. this may also soften her up to the idea of caregivers if she is against them...thinking about her future as a full time caregiver 5+ years down the road. 

While you’re there, check their house for hazards. People with Alzheimers do better in bright light, especially in the winter when the sun sets so early; ensure they have a lot of good light in their house. it also helps prevent falls and injuries since depth perception can go with alzheimers as well. discourage the use of thick area rugs that have edges that can be tripped over, as well as any other trip hazards. offer to install a bar or a chair in their shower if they need that. just do some general things so you know theyre a *little* bit safer on their own. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this, and it might be hard to have those conversations with your mom but its the only way you can sleep soundly knowing you tried your best to get them to be safe short of uprooting your whole life and moving in with them.
I'm in a very similar situation.... my step mother's drinking causes me massive anxiety as well knowing that she's my father's caretaker. I wish I had helpful advice.  Unfortunately I'm looking for some advice as well as this situation is a train wreck coming. I feel your pain.
That’s a double whammy. I don’t know how to approach the drinking because people get super defensive when approached about that. But maybe if you get your mom into some support groups (even informal support groups) for people living with family with dementia she may start accepting his diagnosis and decline and perhaps get motivated to get herself together so she can be a better support for her hubby.

The Alzheimer’s Association is a good resource for formal support groups. For something more informal you could try an online program- this is an NIA funded movement program that includes some group interactions https://togetherseniorhealth.com/current-research-study-rp",2022-03-29 17:26:28,Snoo23577,trn963
Alzheimers,Nervous to Meet Someone with Alzheimer's for the First Time,"I've never met anyone with Alzheimer's before, but am visiting my aunt who was diagnosed in 2014 next week. I haven't seen her since 2011. Although I will be with her daughter, whom she lives with, I am still nervous-- I know she won't know who I am, but what questions do I ask? How do I introduce myself? How do I converse with her while still treating her with respect and as a human?

Thanks in advance for the answers.","This may sound crazy, but let her lead the discussion.  Don't ask questions, and I probably wouldn't even introduce myself -- just be friendly and warm.  If she doesn't know who you are or wants to know, let her ask or defer to the others around (those more familiar with her condition) to facilitate any dialogue with her.  But let her lead the discussion and just be warm and friendly.  Don't correct any mistaken memories, don't engage in any topics beyond, literally, the here and now.

Follow-up thought: be prepared for her to say things that are uncomfortable, perhaps even to the point of being mean or rude.  Don't take any of this personally.  My Mom and her father both have/had (respectively) early onset AD, and like many people with AD, they have no filter and are prone to unknowingly say cruel things off the cuff.  They both also get/got agitated very easily.  Just be friendly and patient, and don't take anything that does or doesn't happen personally.  This disease is fucking horseshit of an experience for the patient and everyone around them.
Also depends on the level but my dad likes to just make really random jokey chat. It’s his way to cover that he doesn’t really know what’s going on.
So avoid referential conversations that need them to remember something you said a moment ago, like talking about your job, asking what she did yesterday etc.
Instead just tell funny random anecdotes or make chat about objects or surroundings.
My advice is to just act like you normally would. They will probably ask you some of the same questions repeatedly, but each time just act like it's the first time they have asked.
Just relax, if you f up, they won't remember. It's just really sad, my Mom is in a memory care facility and all in all, it really sucks. Looking after and care for family is necessary, even if it breaks your heart, everytime.
You'll have to play it by ear, because you don't know at what stage in her illness she is.  She might surprise you by remembering you!  Or perhaps she has lost language, and there is no point in asking her anything.

You have nothing to be afraid of.  She's unlikely to bite you.
People with Alzheimer's tend to be different person to person and even day to day. If you have time, a good YouTube playlist is Teepa Snow's [Making Visits Count.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUgPm8RMa48&list=PL2E2lPBsUeBjA1Utglo8q6yANAijEf8cX) (It's like an hour talk in total, it's just broken up into smaller chunks.)

With my friend, my theory is that I meet him in his world, because he can't travel to mine. He's not great with questions, so we just take turns remarking on things that he takes pleasure in, like the view or the cats or his beloved wife. The conversation doesn't go deep, and we cover the same ground frequently, but that's fine--the point is the togetherness, not some intellectually probing discourse. He also remembers me better as we start to laugh together over silly stuff. 

If you can get tips from the family on things she currently enjoys or appreciates, that's a great place to go, and if not, just note what seems to draw her attention and go on with that.
Her brain is damaged. The best thing you can do for the both of you, is to play along. Her time is more limited than yours is. If you want to visit, remember that it not about you.
My dad has early onset and doesn’t remember me but remembers some friends of his so you never really know. Just go with the flow. This might be obvious but try to avoid phrases like “remember when” or “you just said”. Like someone previously said, if they start talking about something that isn’t true just go along with it. My dad and others at his facility really enjoy listening to music so sometimes when he gets frustrated I distract him with music on my phone. I’ve noticed many people at his facility enjoy the little things. Find out what she likes. Try different things. I was amazed to see that although my dad doesn’t communicate much, he LOVES hitting a balloon back and forth. Not sure if this is the case with your aunt, but although my dad isn’t really “there” he does pick up on nerves or sadness so try to enjoy yourself the best you can. There’s no one way to approach someone with Alzheimer’s, I wish there was. Just do your best :)
Play some of her favorite music. She'll love it.",2022-03-29 03:40:09,myleswstone,tquhig
Alzheimers,anyone have any experience being a Rep Payee?,"I found out that to ""manage"" someone's Social Security benefits/payments, a Power of Attorney is not enough - you need to be the individual's Representative Payee.

But I don't know what the SSA means by ""managing"" benefits.  Does anyone have any experience in needing to ""manage"" the benefits, so that becoming a Rep Payee makes sense?  I don't understand the need, and why a POA wouldn't be enough for most cases?

TIA!","Going through exactly this right now. I need to establish rep payee to sign my dad up for medicare in the next month (his diagnosis was poorly timed there). POA means nothing to SSA, they don't even want to see it. Had to go through a nightmare of calls to get to people who gave me the steps, and am now waiting to see if it worked.

Also pisses me off that POA isn't good enough for some financial institutions. I had to get notarized letters of incapacitation and shit to gain access to his assets to pay for care. This took over a month in some cases! Just over this crap.

For those who have POA, don't assume it won't be a circus to actually be able to use it.
I'm rep payee for my parent. It's super annoying, and as you say POA isn't enough. Neither is guardianship. You have to specifically go through a process with the Social Security administration that in my case resulted in the need for a recent statement from a doctor that my parent is incapacitated because the guardianship documentation was not recent enough. You also have to answer questions demonstrating that you're the best person to do it and you have to provide documentation.  You also have to sign stuff that says you'll follow all their rules about how you can use the funds on the person's behalf (the managing part). You probably need a new bank account for the person to accept the funds, which you are required to set up direct deposit for, and you have to do a yearly accounting for what you did with the funds. Fun, huh?
Hmmm, we haven't run into this. We just added my wife and I to my mom's bank account. So between our POA and being on her account with our own cards, we've been able to handle everything.
We are going through this now. My grandmother was the rep payee for my uncle for years. She just had his SSDI sent to his checking account, never filed reports or anything. Now SSA just sent a letter saying that since she died, they won't send him money until a new one is identified.

Alzheimers,"My dad just turned 80, had a CT scan that showed mild brain atrophy and he is becoming very forgetful. How do you differentiate dementia from alzheimers?","My dad has become increasingly forgetful. He frequently forgets how to get home, or he forgets a conversation that we just had 15 minutes ago. Once I remind him, then he remembers. For example, he needs surgery on his carotid artery. I'm arranging it for him. I was on the phone with him talking about it. I hung up, called and spoke to his doctor to set a pre surgery appointment. I called my dad back, literally 10 minutes or less later. I said ok dad we have to meet with the surgeon before they will schedule your surgery. He said ""What surgery?"". 
I said, the one we just talked about. Your carotid is 80% blocked. We just talked about it. After a slight pause, he said oh oh ok yeah now I remember. Stuff like this happens a lot. Then suddenly he will be fine. 

How do you tell the difference between normal aging, vascular dementia and alzheimers?","You leave that to the professionals.  They combine clinical exam, neuropsych testing, and brain scans to  come up with the ""best guess"" which is really all they can do, prior to a post-mortem.

Get an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in dementia, or go for geriatric assessment at a Department of Geriatrics.  You father's primary care doctor can refer him.  It's a good idea to communicate either by mail/email or telephone ahead of time with some of your observations, to clue the doc in that a real assessment is needed.  Also it's best if you accompany your dad (or someone does), or he's likely to hear what he wants to hear and report back to you, ""Doc says to just enjoy myself.""  (That's not what Doc said!!)
Alzheimers IS a form of DEMENTIA.  The only way to diagnose Alzheimers is post death via autopsy.  Vascular dementia and Alzheimers typically go hand in hand.  My Mom was dxed with both.

Best to you and your Dad
Please check into getting his driver's license revoked. My dad got in a pretty serious accident, lucky no one was hurt but two cars were totalled. He was just going to the grocery store about 1/2 mile from his house, his accident was about 3 miles from the store, he forgot where it was.
Basically Alzheimers is the advanced progression of physical impairment of the brain via shrinking and other damage.   


What you have there is a lack of bloodflow and that's another (hopefully correctable) condition.
The current state of the art for diagnosing Alz is an Amyvid PET scan, which looks for amyloid plaque. It was quite the task getting insurance to pay for it though.
My dad was diagnosed w early stage Alzheimer’s via a blood test and spinal tap. There are specific markers the Dr looks for in those tests. He had several other cognitive & motor tests along the way as well.",2022-03-27 22:53:41,saynotogrow,tpzlg4

Alzheimers,insight into stubbornness and decision making,"Hi everyone,

I know both being stubborn and having trouble making decisions are symptoms of Alzheimer's but I wanted to know why this is, if anyone knows. As time goes on my grandma has been getting increasingly disinterested (?) In choosing things, like we will ask what she wants to eat or what shampoo she prefers or if she needs stuff and she'll just say ""whatever"". She was always kind of easygoing about that kind of thing but it's like she's incapable of making a choice, like she literally has no preferences.... Is this the case or can she maybe not express her thoughts right...?

The other problem recently is stubbornness. Like I said above usually she just goes with whatever people are saying but there's some things she's chosen as like her hill to die on. For example she saw something in our neighbor's yard and asked my mom if it was in neighbor #1s yard or neighbor #2s yard. My mom said ""its in neighbor #1s yard"" and my grandma said things like, ""maybe YOU think so"", ""they might think that but it's in neighbor #2s yard"", ""hmmm I don't believe you"". Another example is taking showers. My mom will ask her to take a shower and recently she even yelled and said ""no I don't want to!"" My mom asked her why not and she eventually said it was difficult...to open the shower door. This takes maybe 10 seconds and while it might be hard it's only 10 seconds and then it's over? We are lucky to get her to take a shower once a week at this point.

Does anyone know anything about these? Why this shows up in Alzheimer's, how it's a part of it and what we can do to address it? Thanks for any suggestions.","I really recommend Teepa Snow for understanding more; she's a very respected name in Alzheimer's caregiving, and she's practical and funny and smart as a whip. I got into her via [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUgPm8RMa48&list=PL2E2lPBsUeBjA1Utglo8q6yANAijEf8cX), but there are lots of other videos.

The short version is it's because the part of her brain that can make those decisions or perform those actions is damaged. You're still thinking of it as a behavior that she's adaptively choosing rather than ability that she's simply lost. 

Think of something that's going to be natural to a lot of people but that you might struggle to do. For me it could be college-level calculus (or any calculus at all, really). Imagine being in a family where everybody does this breezily and then being asked to solve a calculus problem--that's likely to be how your grandmother feels when asked to make a decision. Not only can't she do it, it's stressful to be asked. What she wants more than chicken or steak is not to have to make the decision in the first place.

The shower thing could be any number of things, and I wouldn't overfocus on what she *says* is the reason. But even if it is, I would ask you to reconsider the ""even if it's hard, it's only 10 seconds and then it's over."" The same could be said for drilling a cavity without novocaine, but not many people sign up for that either. So maybe it hurts her hand, or she's not sure if she's opening the door correctly and that's why it's not opening, or the bathroom lighting is confusing or the floor is slippery or it's cold, or she's struggling to get clothes on and off, or she forgets why she was in the bathroon, or she doesn't give a damn about taking a shower now because she can't smell anything bad and she doesn't enjoy them, so why bother?

Addressing it often means letting it go. On the first, don't ask her to make decisions, especially time-sensitive ones where somebody is impatiently waiting for an answer. The answer to ""They might think that but it's in neighbor #2's yard"" is ""Oh, could be. Good spotting."" 

For the shower, it might be time for assistance in the process, not just the direction to take the shower. Physical objects are great for taking the blame in this--""That door is so tricky it takes two people nowadays, so let me give you a hand to take a shower now,"" and while you do it you can note anything else that seems to be an obstacle along the way.
The decision issue is because thought is much harder when you have dead brain cells.  I try to be sympathetic about it, or sometimes order for my husband and he seems relieved.

I don't agree that Alzheimer's people are necessarily stubborn.  They might find something confusing or upsetting, and not want to admit that.

As to what to do with it - roll with the punches.  Never argue back with a firmly held position, either say nothing, or agree that ""I see, that's reasonable.""

Two other things to know about dealing with dementia.  It's okay to lie, as long as it's something not likely to be found out; and redirecting is much better than direct confrontation.

Good luck!
Never argue with a dementia patient, even over something as simple and clear to you as the property lines of your neighbours. As their brain changes due to the dementia so does their perception, understanding and ability to communicate effectively about the situation. 

As for making decisions, lets say the question is steak or chicken for dinner? Does she understand you are asking her to decide? Does she remember what the choices are? Has she forgotten how to eat a steak dinner? Does she think she needs to help cook, but can't remember how? Her lack of preferences could be down to multiple different pieces of information that just don't exist for her anymore. 

Many dementia patients hate taking showers as the disease progresses: one of the big reasons is due to not liking the water hitting their head and the other is not remembering what to do. Things that can help: don't give her a choice, make sure the bathroom is warm, have warmed towels or robe ready for after she is out, you may need to get in with her so be ready for that, treat it as very routine.
You just have to know that they can't remember 5 minutes or even 5 seconds in the past. They resort to their natural defenses. It will get much worse, and there's no learning curve associated with a deteriorating brain. Stubbornness and the other problems are going to seem minor when she can't feed herself or walk anymore. The most difficult thing to accept is that Alzheimer's is progressive, and there is no rationale that changes that.
so, for the decision making: yes, it comes down to the fact that they can no longer think of options and try to cover it up by just acting like they’re being indecisive. the way to handle this is to say “would you like chicken or steak for dinner?” rather than “what would you like for dinner?”. simply stop asking open ended questions! either-or, or yes-or-no will be relieving for both of you. 

for the stubbornness: similar reason, its because they can tell they’re missing information and it makes them angry/frustrated more often than not, no one likes to feel like they’re forgetting or they’re wrong about something they *think* they’re sure about. solution? just agree with them. even if they are wrong. agree and redirect to something else. make them feel validated because there’s no point in making them feel like they’re wrong and putting them in a bad mood.
Try reaching out to your local Alzheimer's chapter.  They even have support groups for you to share your experiences and ask questions.  

Imagine just having your mind go blank.  And you know that's not right.  First you get scared.  Then you try to figure it out.  Any distractions just makes it worse. Then you go to fight or flight mode.  Just keep it simple.
My mom has had cognitive decline since before the pandemic but was able to hide it pretty well, no socializing probably accelerated it. April ‘21 I visited after being vaccinated (she in SC, me in NYC) I knew she needed someone to come in to help but she still refused so I let it go. Fast forward to January 22… she had a heart attack in the shower and was down for about a day before I sensed something was wrong (spoke with her on a Saturday, she was very disoriented, didn’t return my calls a few days later) & asked a neighbor to check on her. I’ve been here at her house caregiving since; she is and has always been stubborn and hard headed as hell. I’ve learn to deflect and redirect just like when I hang out with a drunken friend. Dementia is brain damage… it won’t get better. Just be kind and try not to take everything they get fixated on to heart. Good luck 🙂",2022-03-27 00:59:04,froggyfriend726,tpcwhp
Alzheimers,Helping support my mum,"Hi guys,

I hope this post is fine. Basically today my mum has been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, most likely alzheimers but we will find out more on a second round of tests in 3 months. It's heartbreaking for her because she has worked in the NHS in the UK on dementia wards for the last 15 or more years and has said it's her biggest fear to forget who her kids are.

I'm out drinking at the moment (just a disclaimer against typos) but I wanted to ask some advice. I am going to have some food and a chat with her shortly. Of course part of that will be emotional support but another part is practicality. I want to start a conversation about doing things to make her life easier because she is okay at the moment but things will be different in ten years time.

For example, she had recently talked about selling her house and mortgaging two to rent out to make passive income. I don't think this will be sustainable with everything in mind so I wanted to advise her to buy something outright that she can own and not have having over her if that makes sense? Similarly I would advise her to live close to myself and my brother so if she needs us we are close by. This isn't at all intended to be patronising or anything I'm honestly just trying to start a conversation around ways to make her life easier for the years that are ahead.

With all that preamble I wanted to ask if you had advice of things we could think about or start talking about in terms of preparing for the future to make sure she is comfortable, happy and independent for as long as she can be. I'm sorry if I am wrong or stupid with anything that I am saying; she is an amazing woman and my hero and has been a mum and a dad to me and I am just searching for anything I can that will make life better and give her less stress if that makes sense?","If you were in the US, I would tell you to get a durable power of attorney and living will. I don't know if you need that in the UK. There are a bunch of resources pinned to the top of the Dementia subredit. 

I would recommend you have an honest conversation about what she wants for her future while she is still able.

I'm so sorry you were just hit with the probable diagnosis. Sending you a big drunken hug.
Between my grandmother and my mom, I've been dealing with Alzheimer's for forty years, and when I read these sad stories, I want to be in support, but I still never know what to say. This is going to be a tough time, and keep it simple as possible, but if your mom is still lucid, take care of the financial matters as soon as possible, with an eye towards the very real possibility that living in her own home will not be permanent. The more you can prepare for in advance, the better. Having other family members to help, is very important, as well, if you have them.

Cheers! 🥂
Don't rush her talking about extended decisions.  It could overwhelm her.  

One thing that has worked well for me is to involve a social worker in some difficult discussions.  

You might also want to get in therapy yourself to help you cope with the stresses and sadness.  It doesn't have to be weekly, maybe monthly or quarterly would feel right to you.  I see a psychologist monthly and find it very helpful.
I second the top comment. Get a power of attorney and a will. Im in the UK and helping my nana with it now. It covers both finances and health. I know it sounds controlling and patronising right now - but down the line there will be a point when shes no longer in capacity to make decisions and that is where you as a family will need to step in. This is as a safeguard for her wellbeing and assets knowing its someone she trusts managing this when she cant in her best interest. She expresses the wishes and powers she wants, and who she appoints to act as her attorneys as though they were her. It doesn't have to come into effect until she's without capacity if thats a concern right now too! There are loads of options. I'm in Scotland so if youre in another nation im not sure of the protocols, but speak to the memory clinic about all of this (they usually have handy info packs for both patient and family/carers). Most importantly, look after yourself as well as mum! Its so exhausting doing all of this at times, as much as you love them. Reach out to carer and family support services for advice on how to proceed. Theyre the experts at the end of the day. But ill also add that your own mum is an expert in herself; having a frank, open and empathetic conversation (while acknowledging there may be conflicts of opinions or difficulty in accepting diagnosis) is the best way forward to ensuring things are done the way your mum sees fit for herself. Its still her and her life, youre just helping making things a bit easier. 

Other little helpful things, you may or may not use them yet depending on how troublesome her memory can get at present:

-leave notes for all important stuff like brushing teeth twice a day next to mirror in toilet, how long and what temp to cook food in micro or oven. Keep a notepad by the phone for her to write things as soon as the call ends.

- buy a big digital clock that says the time and full date and the time of day it is in full display in common area (nana loves this!)

- have a weekly wall planner that has reminders to do things like go food shop or do a bit of dusting

- Speak to Occupational Therapy through social work to get adjustments to the home that make appliances and things more user friendly and safer to ensure shes independent at home as long as possible

- continue with stable routines/habits e.g. leaving keys by table at the front door, going to see you for coffee at the same day and time

- if she takes medications, get the GP to change them to blister packs that portion it into the day of week and time of day which js delivered to her home weekly. Call to remind and wait until shes taken it, if this is a point of issue. 


Good luck and stay well all of you xx",2022-03-24 18:54:45,bb-Dozer,tn7v5m
Alzheimers,I can’t tell if my dad (62) is developing Alzheimer’s or just getting old,"Firstly I want to apologise in case I use any terms or anything incorrectly, I don’t know a lot about Alzheimer’s so I’m going with what I’ve read.

I (18) have noticed my dad’s changing behaviour since around 2020. At the start of the pandemic specifically he became irritable and argumentative, we assumed it was just him being bored and angry about covid so he was taking it out by saying outrageous things and fighting with me and my siblings about them. Though me and my dad have a great relationship and have never fought about anything major, he always loves to be a contrarian so while it was annoying it wasn’t anything crazy out of the ordinary. 

In fairness, a lot of his behaviours sound like symptoms of dementia although he has never really gotten “worse”, is always just the same eg he gets very stressed about things like making dinner, giving lifts or going on trips. Recently he forgets things like what I’m doing, eg a couple days ago I had to travel to a different city and told him I needed a lift to the bus, and on the day of he forgot and I had to jog his memory quite a bit before he remembered.

Basically, I can’t tell if this is just him getting old or if it’s signs of early-onset Alzheimer’s. Or if the term “getting old” actually stems from a misunderstanding of what Alzheimer’s is? The thought of it affecting my dad petrifies me and it weighs on my mind a lot. I’m scared to “lose” my dad since I am so close to him and my siblings and I are still pretty young. I don’t want to bring it up with my younger siblings or my mother who works 40+ hrs and is also pretty much full time studying, as I don’t want to scare any of them especially if I’m just overthinking. Thank you for taking your time to read :)","Some of these things could be indicative of dementia, but honestly, what you are describing does not sound like dementia to me. Only a doctor can say.

For context, what we've experienced over time with my mother who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, was much more the classic progression of memory issues.

She started having difficulty keeping up with her finances. Forgetting to pay bills, paying them twice because she forgot she paid them already, ordering things she already had, then not knowing where her money would go. Etc.

issues with short term memory. Forgetting what day/year it was, what state she was in, whether she had eaten or not, forgetting recent conversations or events. Asking the same questions or telling the same story over and over.

hygiene issues. Things like not bathing or brushing her teeth for days. When we would bring it up she would insist she had just taken a shower or brushed her teeth.

forgetting what to do or how to operate during normal daily activities like using a computer, her phone, using the tv remote, the microwave, etc.

She hid it well at first, but over time it became more and more obvious she was struggling.

Again, I am no doctor, but what you are describing sounds more like age-related forgetfulness, but it's hard to say without getting him to the doctor to be checked.
Alzheimer’s is really difficult to diagnose just by symptoms so there’s no real way for you specifically know he has it, there’s so many things that have to be ruled out before a neurologist considers it Alzheimer’s (coming from someone whose dad was diagnosed with it at 61/62). The symptoms he’s showing could be caused from other things that maybe should be looked at by a primary care doctor first (I’m not sure exactly what but there’s plenty of possibilities) 

If he shows more serious signs of forgetfulness you can and should encourage him to go to his primary care doctor and/or neurologist. He will probably fight against going or roll his eyes but IF he is experiencing dementia there is help out there to slow things down so getting to the root of it sooner rather than later is a great move.

I wouldn’t jump to conclusions but I very much empathize with your situation, hope all is okay with your dad ♥️
I am not an expert but if you are noticing those things at his fairly young age, it is worth looking in to. Try talking with your mom about it; this is a lot for you to carry alone. Your mom could be noticing things but she’s afraid to worry you about it. Ideally you or Mom could talk to Dad about it. If he is willing to talk w his Dr about seeing a neurologist that would be best to sort things out and get treatment if needed. You are an intuitive person and your dad is lucky to have someone like you in his corner.",2022-03-24 17:32:58,bunny2guns,tn64gw
Alzheimers,Safeguarding? Really?,"My mom's neighbour is getting worse and her half sister and friend are doing next to nothing to help her, instead, just leaving it all to my 81 year old mom to worry about. The neighbour, who I'll refer to as F, does not look after herself, wears the same clothes for days, repeatedly goes to the bank to withdraw money, which she then secretes somewhere, forgets where it is, then goes back for more, and is often lost, dazed and confused in the street, a mile or so down the road.

Meanwhile, despite my mom relaying all this back to her half sister and friend, all they say is that, because F is adamant she doesn't want strangers (carers) in the house, their hands are tied. They also just say 'she has safeguarding in place'. Uh, ok.

So, it's all on my mom.

Aaaaargh.","You can call adult protective service and have someone check on her. When my mom had memory issues and was living by herself, she fell.  When the doctor checked her she was ok but  he had a social worker visit the house W  They were actually very helpful with us getting the care she needed and some physical therapy.  We had talked to mom before her fall and she insisted on living by herself. The accident  helped her get the help she really needed. hopefully she can get some help before anything serious happens.
Well, if it's too much for your mom, she can always step back - she isn't family, after all.  But maybe your mom likes to feel needed?

If you call the local social service agency, and describe the above, they most likely can have a social worker make a friendly visit.  They won't drag the neighbor off in chains, it's more social.  They can perhaps offer that there are free rides to lunch at the senior center, or something like that to get her involved.

Nice of you to care!",2022-03-24 17:59:41,danger_of_biscuits,tn6ozv
Alzheimers,Alzheimer’s Association 24/7 Helpline 1-800-272-3900,"There are a lot of you on here that ask for resources to help you as a caregiver. I just wanted to plug that the Alzheimer’s Association has a free 24/7 helpline that can be translated into over 100 languages. The people answering the helpline calls are all social workers with a masters degree and can help with any question you have - ranging from “what is Alzheimer’s” all the way to you being in a crisis and need guidance on how to handle the situation. They can also help connect you to local support, like support groups, care consultants, education, etc. It’s an amazing resource that I highly recommend.","Thank you so very much
This hotline SAVED me when I was navigating my mom’s first steps into her Alzheimer’s. They are so kind and so helpful. If they don’t have the answer, they are great at directing you where to go to get one. 10/10 give them a call if you need help!",2022-03-24 12:54:25,kimbehr,tmnb9h

Alzheimers,Are there any apps for Alzheimers patients or their caregivers?,"Title is pretty self explanatory, it could be for Android or iOS, the more suggestions the better, and thank you in advance.

If you use it and could describe why and how it helps you, that would also be much appreciated. What are the features you like and what features did you wish it had?

Thank you!","I use an iOS app called Memory Lane with a patient when I need a distraction.  It is a VERY simple trivia game filled with photos and nostalgia.  It was designed specifically for Alzheimers patients.  And it is free with no adds or upgrades/offers!

[Memory Lane](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/memory-lane-games/id1517193093)

I wish there were more apps/games for entertainment purposes.  It is impossible to find simple games (like maybe a match 3 type game) that DON’T get harder as you play, don’t have several in game currencies to unlock features, and don’t require navigating through menus to start game play.

I also had to use an app to create picture button icons on a smart phone that can be used to call loved ones.  I don’t remember the name of it.
Whoever is caregiving for someone with Alzheimer's, try joining support group.  I was in a few.   Some better than others.
There is an app called Alz Science Hub. It’s mostly focused on research, but also has good information about resources for help.",2022-03-23 15:22:23,No_Werewolf_6517,tl8zgl
Alzheimers,My mom was admitted to hospice,"If you saw my last post, I was just exploring the possibility that it could happen, and now it’s official. I ended up having a talk the week before last with my mom’s (64 F) daycare about her general decline, they agree she has declined, and said they didn’t think it would be any trouble for her to be evaluated and qualify.

We had the hospice referral appointment with her PCP last Tuesday, and it hit me harder than I was anticipating. So much so, I ended up calling out sick for work the next day, and took a me day while mom was at daycare. The first hospice agency referred to us by the PCP was not a first choice of the woman who runs the support group that I’m in, and I trust her opinion. She sent me some recommendations, and we ended up signing with the second agency on her list. My mom really qualified without any second thought. They’ll provide a shower chair, a wheelchair and a hospital bed as soon as I have room for them to. I got her a rollator last week that has been helping at daycare. Other supplies will be provided as well. Of course I just did a pretty recent big restock of diapers and wipes…

I’m a little nervous that I’m not actually going to get the extra help and relief I need. A nurse will come out twice a week, and an aid can come out 5, but only for an hour to get her ready for the day. She can still go to daycare and be on hospice as long as she does not become completely hard to care for in their facility. She will be assigned a social worker who may be able to help me figure out more in home health services or short term respite care. I know I need to see how this even plays out to start. They can arrange a 5-7 day skilled nursing facility stay for respite otherwise. 

My mom doesn’t understand much anymore. What do I tell her about this? Do I keep it simple and just say they’re new friends coming to help, or do I tell her that she’s on hospice? I have a feeling it’s the former, but want to get some input. She’s also interestingly started to increase the frequency in which she says things like “I’m going to die,” “just leave me to die,” or even “I don’t want to die,” when nothing of that topic has even come up around her. Is this a sign she knows it could be happening, or is it just the insecurities of the disease? I mean, she’ll say it at the most random times sometimes. I could be putting her socks on or getting her out of bed, and she’d say it. 

I’ve been extra emotional this week. It’s so hard having so many emotions and not knowing what to do with them all. These past few weeks have been stressful as hell, and I’m starting to feel it in other ways too, which is scary. I probably need to have a physical scheduled as soon as possible.","Hey there. I am in a very similar situation, my mom (67) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 7 years ago. She has been on hospice for the last 3 months and they have been wonderful. Accept the extra help, yeah you can shower your mom but it's great to be able to hand off some care.  Caregiver fatigue is a real issue, please make sure you're taking care of yourself. I am deep in this too, message me if you want to chat.
Waa, you've done some tough miles!   It's great for you both that you'll be receiving additional hours & help, well done!  I suppose just tell her they're new friends coming to help.   I'm in Australia so our system is different, Idk.   Probably a 5-day break would be really good for you, give some time to catch up with yourself.  Best of luck with everything!
Hi.  Just put your Mom in hospice.  Tough go.  U did wonderfully!!!   My dad passed from dementia.  Mom elected to keep him at home, for familiarity.  Before mom passed, she & my brother arranged for 24/7 care.  He did ok.  Fortunately, his heart got him in the end.  I kept praying for our Lord to take him Home.  He was confused, yet always pleasant.  On day he was brought to hospital, he even complimented an employee of his tie.   Dad wore many ties, & he knew ties.
I applaud your efforts getting your Mom into hospice.
She may not understand why she's there, perhaps telling her those are her new friends is best.
Best of luck.",2022-03-23 01:10:47,shady-pines-ma,tkmllj

Alzheimers,Ptsd after losing someone to Alzheimer’s?,I don’t know if ptsd is the right word I’m sorry if it’s not. In 2020 I lost my grandmother to Alzheimer’s and that was hard but just last month I lost my second grandmother to Alzheimer’s I was much closer with her and saw her decline first hand Since then I’ve been having panic attacks and freak out when my mom or other family members forget things. I’m laying in bed crying worried about having to go through that ever again does anyone else have this problem?,"PTSD is a very sensible way of describing what's happening. The mind watches the world around it, creates memories, and ""marks"" (whether chemical or physical structural changes, I don't know) some memories as ""more important than others."" This is apparently an evolutionary adaptation to help us see potentially dangerous situations ahead of time, and take appropriate action to avoid the same danger in the future. That's PTSD in a nutshell. (I'm not a doctor or psychologist).

You might want to reach out to a therapist. You're not ""broken,"" but there are probably strategies you can use to desensitize you to those messages from your brain, place them in clearer perspective.

Another direction might be reaching out to a grief therapist. You've lost two loved ones to a vivid, horrible disorder in a short amount of time, and during a point in history where there's more than enough upheaval, chaos, death, stress, and just plain crappy news to go around and mess anyone up. 

My sincere condolences on your losses; and big, warm internet hugs to you.
Other commenter is right, i definitely had diagnosed ptsd when my dad had it and after he died it changed but it was still there. Hair triggers, recurrent nightmares, hypervigilance and everything. 

I would also suggest you consider joining a support group. They are free, and they used to be in person, but since covid there are many online: https://www.alz.org/help-support/community/support-groups . The anxiety you describe is similar to what many folks experience.. you may find comfort that its not just you. 

Maybe you can find a good fit for you. . Good luck.",2022-03-22 01:55:47,hakunamatada2244,tjw586
Alzheimers,It just feels like it happened over night,"My grandmother was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago, but we knew long before she finally agreed to see the neurologist. Since the diagnosis it just feels like everything has now progressed so rapidly. Just last week things were bad, but after going away for the weekend I returned to the news from my mother that she had gotten substantially worse in the few days I had been gone. 

A couple days ago my grandmother was barely capable of holding a conversation, but now she isn’t even able to string together a couple of words coherently. She can no longer walk on her own, though she was shaky before, to be fair. The scariest part is I’m sitting in the ER right now, and I can swear I hear the death rattle.  She has also been mumbling what sounds like my grandfather’s name. He has been dead for 15 years.

So far we have ruled out a stroke, and they don’t seem to think she has any sort of infection. I just can’t wrap my head around how quickly this is all happening. My own theory is that she has just given up and is ready to go. It is heartbreaking. 

I’m sorry there is no real point to my post. I just sort of needed an outlet for my feelings with some people that understand. There is so much more going on with it, but the last couple days have been hell.","I'm very sorry to hear this. Alzheimer's is a fucking awful disease. My first thought was a UTI. My mother has Alzheimer's and she would get very, very bad when she had an UTI. She made sandwiches for my dad who died in 2011. She couldn't read a clock, understand the time, or why it was dark outside. She was angry and threatened to punch me. She went outside in the middle of the night to look for the family dog we had 40 years ago. She made no sense at all. I sincerely hope your grandmother is just going through a bad spell.
So sorry for you!

My mother is also rapidly getting worse in the last few weeks.  
She's still ""here"" but I can really feel the disease now when before she was only was asking the same questions a lot.  


  
Stay strong for both of you.
Every timing is different, my mom has been calling for her mom for a few years now and she died 45 years ago. My mom has been bedridden and immobile for almost 17 months now and her limbs have been ""frozen"" for well over 6 months now. The big change that just happened a little over a week ago is she no longer responds when you try to talk to her, but she will still carry on to the ""invisible"" but in a much lower voice than she did months ago.

It really does seem like she is near the end now but we said that throughout all of 2021. She is 87 and has been at stage 7 for well over 5 years and with obvious moderate stage dementia for over 15 years. My mom definitely has the prolonged version of the disease and it's been terrible for several years now.
Memories usually go back to where they remember people from their past, that’s maybe why she’s saying your grandfather’s name. Definitely check out the UTI connection tho!",2022-03-22 10:10:40,imwalkingafteryou,tk3vn5

She should not be able to know her own name or formulate a sentence let alone write a book.  

Truthfully the vast majority of people diagnosed in 2014 with early onset Alzheimer's would likely be deceased by now or completely debilitated.  There's no way she could have contributed to this book unless the diagnosis is wrong.

 Even her first book in 2018 (4 years after diagnosis) is far too along in an early onset Alzheimer's disease course to be able to write a book even with assistance.  Smells pretty fishy.",2022-03-21 17:28:20,Bolehillbilly,tjmib4
Alzheimers,What were the first signs that your loved one has Alzheimers?,My grandmother is fiercely independent but lately has not been able to function the way she used to. I'm in a worrisome debate if it's regular aging or signs of something more serious.,"Forgetting conversations we’d had the day before and misplacing car keys and stuff all the time
2011, my mom was complaining about the fancy new name that they gave the “tidal wave” that hit Japan. I knew for a fact that she knew what that word, even pulled a book she had of historic Japanese painting that showed a tsunami that she showed me and read the text. She just had no clue. It bugged me for a long time. It might be small, insignificant, but looking back it was one of many things that she just lost over the years.
There were a few things for me:

 - His driving got worse. An excellent driver, he started to get into car accidents. He would drive over the white lines in the middle of the road. Drove a lot slower than usual and would  ignore usual traffic ""politeness"".

- He would forget basics of computer games he had played thousands of hours with me.

- He wasn't able to grasp new games, even with my guidance.

- We would call each other over Skype to play our weekly games. Did this for years. He started calling me on Facebook instead.

Those were the main ones. My Dad was always defined by being a very smart geek, with excellent driving skills. As soon as I started to see changes to those key abilities of his, I knew something was off.
Not being able to pay bills or follow recipes, she would just get too overwhelmed.
It started with loss of words, then using same words over to describe different things. Then, came rambling words that didn’t make sense. All the while, refusal to see a professional. Hiding and denying changes. And, of course the frequent accidents that weren’t her fault.   It took a year but the state finally took her driving privileges away.
Reversing pronouns. “He” was always “she,” and “she” was always “he.” That started cropping up in 2017 when she didn’t even register as having MCI on the MOCA (scoring 29/30). That was also the year my 23&Me came back showing I had a copy of the APOE4 gene and I knew then, in my gut, my mom was on that path. A few months later, her 23&Me also showed she had a copy of the gene. 

Then, slowly over the next few years, more and more words began to be replaced, if a store closed, it had “died,” if a tire was flat, it was “dead.” Now, on her worst days, every other noun is just a “thing.” She’s still early stage and can live independently with very little assistance, but she’s right at the tipping point to middle dementia.

Fell on the carpet) I called his regular doctor and asked him to order a urine test. Of course it came back as a major bladder infection. He’s now on antibiotics. What would have happened if I hadn’t followed up and just let the infection rage?!? What could the hospital possible be thinking by not running such a simple test?!? Ugh, so frustrating!! So, insist on a urine test!","That’s insane.   You can buy uti test strips even on Amazon.   I kept them in the house so I could check as my husband was prone to them.  Everytime he acted oddly I could rule that out without it being a big deal.  Prior to that his primary care Doctor just had me drop off urine to test.  I combined these so I only had to get the doctor involved when I was sure it wasn’t just a odd turn.  It’s not always a UTI but it’s nice to rule one out before it becomes severe.
My dad has had 3 bad accidents/falls on account of having a bad UTI. First was a car accident (still early on in his diagnosis), another was a horrible face plant onto pavement, and lastly a tumble down the stairs.

What is it about AD patients and UTI? It’s crazy how much damage they can do to people with Alzheimer’s.",2022-03-20 20:37:57,ntenufcats,tiz8mg
Alzheimers,How old were you when your parent was diagnosed? Should I go away to school?,"I’m 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when i was 17/18. I lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel I missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. He has narcissistic personality disorder so I was also dealing with that abuse at the time. I had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like “you’re the only reason i’m here” all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. This obviously lead me to think if i left he would attempt suicide (which he has multiple times). 

I’m having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. I feel like i’ve made so many decisions based on everyone else’s happiness instead of my own, it feels like it’s been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i’ve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. Some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. It makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. I want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what’s going on with him and help to make decisions. I’ve realized i guess all i can do is give the court my and my fathers truth and at a certain point it’s out of my hands what they choose. It’s hard for these things not to absorb my whole life, it becomes all i think and worry about and i begin to feel so hopeless. 

I guess i’m wondering people’s thoughts on that, whether you’re my age or someone older. Am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? I’ve never left my childhood town long term, i’ve always wanted to. It’s so hard because i want to be true to myself and give myself these experiences, but i feel like i’m potentially betraying my father. Also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer’s at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it. 

I think if my dad wasn’t sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. He always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. Thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts. 

- my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week","Imo, go.  You are not a bad person.  Alzheimer's is already stealing what is left of his life.  Don't let it steal yours.  

That being said, I'm a 45 year old man, missing out on many things, including things with my own child, to continue caring for my mom who is on hospice and could remain so for god knows how long.

It sounds like you have already put your father before yourself.  I think you should focus on yourself for a bit.
I was 22. Had just graduated college and was going to attend graduate school. Ended up not going to go stay with my mom and try to care for her (no official diagnosis at this point but she was not able to hold a job and had very clear signs. We knew it was Alzheimer’s)

You should go to school. You’re not a bad person.
Go! He is not your responsibility and you need to grow into adulthood.
Go to school. You're not a bad person for wanting to start your own life. My dad has it too. My mom thinks that he's had it for a while, but his symptoms started getting worse when I was 14ish. I'm in my 20s now and I'm in a similar situation to you. Do what's best for you.
I am glad I lived my life and if I had stayed 24-7 to care for my parent, I would be bitter considering it's a likely possibility for me.  

As long as my memory lasts, I have no regrets.
I echo every one else here - go and live your life to the fullest you can.  I'm hopeful it will be what your father would wish for you.  Good luck OP.  It's truly an awful situation for you to be experiencing at all, never mind from such a young age.  I'm 39 and cared for my dad for about 10 years - we tried to keep him at home for as long as we could but it came to the point that it was no longer safe or dignified for him to remain there.  The respite provided to me since he has been in a care home has been significant - I feel like I can live my life again and do things I've been unable to for the past 10 or so years - and it feels good.  Please don't feel guilty OP.  You deserve to live your life now!
You only get one life, you don't owe it to anyone but yourself.

&#x200B;

I'm proud of you. Please let your parents make their own decisions for their own lives. Live yours.
Alzheimer’s destroys everything. Even if you weren’t within your rights to escape his narcissism (which you are), you would still imho be justified in pursuing your own life. It’s tragic and it’s horrible. But Alzheimer’s destroys everything and that will still be true even if you stay. Good luck with your decision. ❤️
Chiming in with everyone else to say...go! Live your life. Don't feel badly about this. You deserve to be happy and these youthful years are precious ones. Sometimes the kinds of sacrifices that you would need to make can leave you feeling bitter and resentful for many years to come. I don't think your dad would want that for you. He will move through this illness as others have.  And you won't be able to change this trajectory. But you can take charge of your life and your path.
Don’t do what I did and be afraid to live your life.
You are not responsible for his mental health. He has already had his chance to treat you well, and he threw it away. 

That being said, you aren't just losing your father to this disease. You are losing what he could have become. It's hard to grieve a loved one, but it's especially hard to grieve when the relationship is complicated. Please seek out support for yourself, you deserve an ally.

And what ever you end up choosing, do right by yourself first. You can't 'do right by him' if you are burned out. Your health, mental and physical, comes first. Don't break your back.",2022-03-21 01:13:39,dfuqklls,tj4603
Alzheimers,Looking for info RAL/AFC home,"Would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house. 

Better or worst than long term facilities?

Do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio?

If you have worked in or own one I would love to hear from you. Would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion.

Thanks in advance for any help or information.","I have not used either of these, but there was a period where I was looking into them as an option (mom decided to keep dad at home in the end).

Im not sure but i *think* a major deciding factor would be more about what kind of care the facility is qualified to give, and what kind you need. Like some facilities have staff that are allowed to administer medicine, and some may not have staff thats allowed to (patient has to give medicine to themselves). Some facilities aren't allowed to keep someone from wandering out, and some have a special status where they can. Im not sure, but I think both of the types of residences you described may or may not have these features. 

You might want to see if your state and county have a dept on aging or elderly or dementia. They may have guides describing rules that may be specific for your state or maybe even a handy list of facilities identified by type of care. Depending on the level of care, you could eliminate your options quickly. 

Sorry, in case this wasnt helpful i know its not really what you asked.",2022-03-20 10:08:43,ginjamginjam,tilv2e
Alzheimers,Out of options and looking for advice,"my father (68) has alzheimers and up until recently was being cared for exclusively by my grandmother (87).  over the past year, my father's condition has progressively gotten worse and he's started showing signs of anger, anxiety, and aggression.  anti-anxiety meds helped some, but it still got to a point where it was no longer safe for either of them to be in that house together and we made the decision to move him into memory care.  

unfortunately, the transition to memory care did not go well.  within 4 days of moving him in he had assaulted another resident, cornered and threatened a staff member, and refused to eat or take his medications, until the facility finally asked for him to be transferred to a hospital because they couldn't handle him.  

fast forward 6 weeks and in that time, he's been in 3 different hospitals and 2 different geriatric psychiatric facilities.  he was transferred back to memory care after the first psychiatric stay when they thought they had figured out his medication, but after 4 days he had assaulted another resident, was tearing pictures off the wall and throwing them, and had defecated on the floor of another resident's room.  

he's currently on his second geriatric psychiatric stay as they once again try to tweak his meds but i' m not hopeful.  we are one week into what is supposed to be a 1-2 week stay so he's going to be discharged soon.  the memory care facility he was originally in won't take him back and so far we haven't found any others that will take him.  i don't see how he could come home, even with in-home nursing help.  i just can't see how it would be safe for anyone.  

i've checked into some nursing homes but supposedly they are going to cost between 10-15k per month and that's not something we can afford.  i don't believe he will qualify for medicaid as he has a pension that would put him over the eligibility requirements.  

making all this worse is i live on the west coast and am having to manage all of this remotely.  this last 2 months have been so draining and we seem to be out of options.  he can't stay where he is and he can't come home, but there is no place that will take him.  what are we supposed to do?  

i'm posting in hopes that someone maybe has a solution or something i haven't thought of but it all seems so hopeless.","With my mom, we had to private pay until she was bankrupt. In her case, the only med that worked to ease her rage (she broke her own and other people's bones in attacks) was injections of Haldol. Because they had to be injections, we had to have 24-hour skilled nursing, and the doctors reported that it was a must to keep her from being a danger to herself and others. Once she was bankrupt, the way Medicaid worked was they took her pension and SS and returned it was I think $70 per month for her to have personal spending money. If you haven't talked to someone in Medicaid locally, it helps to at least have the conversation with them to see what happens next.
I'm really sorry you're going through this, OP. I was in the same hopeless boat back in October of last year. My dad has increasingly gotten aggressive. Because of COVID, no geriatric psych places would even consider taking him in. His doctor at memory care was having no luck tweaking his medications. His facility was kicking him out and we couldn't find a single place within the state that would consider taking a man with ""behaviors"". We began looking out of state. I also asked about hospice and they agreed to have him evaluated. 

Hospice believed my dad was probably suffering from terminal agitation and we signed him on to hospice. They gave him dilaudid but it didn't slow him down one bit. One of my nurse friends (seeing how hopeless the situation was) recommended I ask hospice about contacting APS. They did and got some social workers involved to help us out in finding a new facility. In the meantime, we had to hire 24/7 caregivers to live with him IN memory care. It was insanely expensive and sad. Somehow we found a facility nearby that would give him a chance as they typically handle people with ""behaviors"". 

We moved my dad to the new place (having hospice on-board was nice because they provided  a hospital bed). He lived there for 2 weeks before passing. I don't know how far along your dad is but ""terminal agitation"" was an entirely new term to me. I'm just sharing my experience.

Reaching out to APS can be scary but we got desperate. Nobody would take my dad and I knew if he got discharged ANYWHERE, that his current memory care would not allow him back in. I feel like I truly tried everything. Sadly there just aren't many resources for when your loved one gets aggressive/violent. And no, you cannot take him back in to the home with your grandmother.

I'm so so sorry. I was in your position only 5 months ago. It's truly awful. I'll be thinking about you. What I did was enlisted my friends' help in asking them to make calls to facilities for me. All they needed to ask was if they were willing to take a man with ""behaviors"". Having someone else make those calls and keep a shared spreadsheet was probably the most helpful. I hope you have friends you can call on.
Such a heartbreaking disease.. so sorry..
You should try posting this question on the forum at agingcare.com the people over there tend to give better advice about these kinds of situations and are more realistic.
This is a long shot, but I was just getting a massage today and in the waiting room, I read something in a ""Massage Therapy"" magazine about Alzheimer's and massage.  As little as 5 or 10 minutes of gentle massage, head, shoulders, neck, back or hands, reduced agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's patients.  It can be done by a CNA, it doesn't have to be a licensed massage therapist.  See if you can get his carers in the hospital to try that every day for a week.

I'd also want to know if it happens only in the latter half of the day (sundowning) or if he has a UTI.  Music might be useful.

Sorry there is so much difficulty with your dad.
I was able to take care of my spouse who got Alzheimer's in 2012. When the violence started the doctor perscribed risperidone .25 mg 3x a day. It was an amazing transformation and helped me be able to do everything at home until passing in 2020.

 I got hospice involved in the last year and a half or so, which set us up with a hoyer lift, hospital bed,  and nursing care 3x a week all covered thru insurance and medicare, when walking no longer was an option.

When covid started I voluntered to do bedbaths and the nursing was reduced to 1x a week to avoid unneeded traffic and risk of covid. This was during the time when it was so horrible in the nursing homes, before vaccines.

I am grateful for the extra time I had, grateful that I didn't need to rely on any of the kids who all had jobs and families, grateful that I didn't need to bankrupt us or move out of this house we have lived together in for 35 years, grateful we never got covid.

I miss my spouse so very much.  Hope this helps and God bless.
I'm sorry I don't have a good or cheap suggestion, as we went through it with my MIL when she was fist admitted to a mental care facility.  She was basically kicked out of three facilities within a matter of a year - anger, aggression/assault, the entire spectrum of bad behaviors.  We were finally able to get he placed into a facility which was able to manage her, both through medication, and through having ""large"" skilled nurses and aides who could control her outbursts.  Unfortunately self-pay, but ultimately became where she was comfortable and realized folks wouldn't tolerate her being an asshole.  Once a lifetime of savings, the home, everything was gone, medicare stepped in and took over.  Facility received every dime, social security, Navy (spouse retirement) pension, everything except a few hundred bucks a month we were able to use for upgrades in food, cable TV, and a room with a view of the plants/garden outside.

What breaks my hear more than anything is I'm on the front edge of this journey with my wife, who was diagnosed with early onset, and is now 67.  I'm not emotionally ready to have to watch the love of my life disappear from me in slow motion while I remain helpless and heartbroken and incapable of making anything better for her.
Please speak with the hospital Social Worker (or have his POA do so). This is a HORRENDOUS situation - none of it is fair or easy & I know it just all feels so brutally overwhelming. The reality is that Dad is likely going to need further adjustments of his medications & an onslaught of behavioural approaches to try & find the balance whereby he's not a danger to himself or others. What I know to be true in my province is that a hospital cannot discharge someone who NEEDS constant care if a sufficient solution is not available. Is the hospital the right place for him, long term? Probably not but until his situation stabilizes, and a Home is found, then I would not be accepting responsibility for him to come home. It's an impossible position to be put in, & the system is SO very broken & I'm so sorry that your family is having to wade through this walking nightmare. Talk to the Social Worker & reach out to the local Alzheimer's Society/ Society For The Aged & ask them for advice as well. Sending you such support over the interwebs. Xo
There’s an anti-psychotic medication that my FIL takes that really helped his aggression. If you want to know the name, DM me, I would have to ask the wife.
Regarding ~~Medicare~~ Medicaid you should talk to an elder care lawyer. Typically, if a person qualifies for  ~~Medicare~~ Medicaid funded care they pay all their assets first, minus a very small amount, and ~~Medicare~~ Medicaid covers the rest. This varies from state to state so be sure to find a lawyer in their area.

How far outside the box?  In an era of finite research spending, there has to be some criterion of study-worthiness.  The ones you cited, OP, seem like a handful of disjointed hypotheses.

Alzheimers,Alzheimer’s or Something Else?,"I’m worried about my mother. She can’t remember the most basic things. She asks me the middle names of my children, names of family members, birthdays, etc. This seems like the early stages of Alzheimer’s. 

What is more alarming to me, though, is her obsession with things. I’m not sure if it’s related to Alzheimer’s and I want your opinions. 

For context, if it’s relevant, She’s on Klonopin and has been for 20 years. She doesn’t take it at the same time each day and often skips some to “save money”. 

She OBSESSES over stuff. For example, if an app she has resets and she loses her ability to login using Face ID, rather than a password, she will spend HOURS trying to fix it. 

When she asks me a question and I’m speaking with someone else, if I don’t immediately answer she will say “SAY” or “HELLO?”

She needs IMMEDIATE answers to text messages or she will send 8-10 at a time. 

She leaves hateful voicemails if I don’t answer the phone. 

She is rude to the waiter / waitress and doesn’t “read The room” or follow social cues.

Alzheimers,Need meds advice.," My mom is well into the later stages of Alzheimer's and can no longer do  any self care. She is constantly anxious and fearful people she sees  will be bad and hurt her. Her restlessness and excitability is really  tiring, so we requested a medication to ease her anxiety. To my surprise  an anti-psychotic ( Aripiprazole ) was prescribed, and while she does  tell imaginary stories I do not see how this drug will address her fear  and anxiety. Anyone got any experience with the effect of this meds with  Alz patients, and any relevant advice? I thought something like  lorazepam would be prescribed.","I do not have any experience with Aripropazol in dementia patients. 

I will say that after my grandmother (probable Alzheimer’s) started taking Seroquel, her mood improved dramatically. At mid-stage, she went from sundowning like 4 times a week to about 3 times a month. we actually had a good many pleasant conversations during that time. I have a family member who is a neurologist who has also seen Seroquel help quite many dementia patients. I bet many other people here can attest to Seroquel’s impact as well. My understanding is that if the dementia is Alzheimer’s it will have the intended mellowing effect, however if it is a different type (FTD or LB, don’t remember) it will immediately make the mood worse. 

My grandmother was also prescribed lorazepam while she was in hospice, but she was one of those minority of people for whom it did not have the intended effect. although it made her sleepy, she became extremely paranoid with the delusion that we had kidnapped her and were holding her hostage. That specific delusion dropped as soon as we cut the lorazepam.
My MIL (moderate stages) takes hydroxyzine twice a day and it works well. She takes 10 mg in the day time, and 25 at night. It has certainly worked well  to keep her anxiety and temper tantrums at bay. 

It is actually an antihistamine but works well for anxiety and can be taken long term.

Since she has high blood pressure and takes meds for that, I doubt she'd ever be on Seroquel.",2022-03-18 16:15:47,WesternWilson,the31z

Alzheimers,Neurologist said something weird? Should we get second opinion?,"Okay, so my dad was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. Because I gave birth to a child and didn't live super close to my parents I was never able to attend many of his doctor appointments. Now I have moved closer and my child is older, so I'm paying closer attention to his health and helping out my mom. One thing that was never made clear to me is what type of dementia he had. So at his last appointment with his neurologist, I asked her what type of dementia is he diagnosed with. And she said, based on his scans it's either Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. She explained that it's hard to tell and that's there's a lot of overlap. So is that a thing? I guess I was looking for something definitive. Not: maybe this, maybe that. I guess from her perspective it's all under the same umbrella, but from my prospective I'm just confused.","Yes, it's a thing.  My Mom also has vascular dementia and alzheimers.  Remember, alzheimers is a form of dementia so you're right, it's all under the same umbrella.

I wish you all the best!

ETA: there is no definitive way to diagnose alzheimers while the patient is alive, it's only when they die that they can say (via autopsy) that it was alzheimers.
Dementia is a symptom with many causes, the most common of which is Alzheimer's. Another common cause is vascular dementia.  A person can also have both. As others have said, Alzheimer's can't be diagnosed with 100% certainty until an autopsy. 

 I've read that Alzheimer's presents as a slow progression whereas vascular dementia will process periodically with sudden changes. A UTI will also appear as a sudden change, but treating the UTI will help improve the sudden problem.
My grandmother has vascular dementia and dementia. Although I did assume they are the same and it's not? Interestingly enough, not diagnosed with alzheimers. 

We went to different doctors and honestly, none were much help. My grandmother is on medication, it's really not improving her symptoms. 

I think going to get a second opinion will help in the sense of getting the right mix of medications if you don't think the Dr. is doing what he can. 

It's awful no matter what, good luck.
My SO has a dementia, undefined diagnosis at this point. For me it appears to be Alzheimer's, but it could be a similar degenerative brain disease. But without an effective treatments or accurate tests, I am not pushing for further diagnostic testing. We are four years into the dementia, I am focused on positive support, seeing that she gets good food, plenty of rest and limit her over stimulation. I give her opportunity to be functional, but step in when she get confused.
Had a similar chat with my mom’s doc when she was diagnosed. He told me that the only true way to tell if it’s Alzheimer’s is to do an autopsy after she passes away. Until then, they use standardized testing.
Just echoing what others have said, Alzehimer's is a diagnosis of exclusion, there's currently no way to actually say for sure, but a blood test is being developed.
I read somewhere that MRI scans show shrinking of the brain with Alzheimer’s, more so than regular senile degeneration. While I’m assuming vascular dementia shows less blood flow>>>less circulation from kidney disease or diabetes>>>cognitive functional decline",2022-03-18 04:28:23,crabblue6,tgwmd9

You know what I’d absolutely melt for? If I came home from work one day and someone had arranged for my mom to be looked after so that they could take me out to dinner as a thanks for everything. 

I know there’s no medals for this, and I don’t really expect it, but making time to really acknowledge your dad’s dedication might really mean the world to him. 

My family is great, but we’ve never been the best with communicating feelings- I keep them updated on my mom, but it would be very out of character for them to ask how I’m really doing.
Go together with him to a support group or 2, whatever you can find, and folk there likely will know of counsellors / therapists specialising in carer support / grief processing.  Folk often research for support but then not follow through - if you find when & where & tell him you're going together with him, then that breaks the ice & starts him off.   Or ask your area alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org, they know for sure.   good luck!
It sounds like he's open to a counsellor—hardest part of the battle. Get his blessings before you take the next step—but my 2¢, select the counsellor, set up an appointment, make sure his ""shift"" with mom is covered for the time he'll need, and gently push him out the door with enough time to get there. 

How to select: If there is a nurse who comes in, then there is some kind of institutional apparatus behind the nurse: hospice, hospital, Medi-care/caid… Reach out to them for referrals, best kind of counsellor to seek. If not, contact his PCP for a referral.

Why you need to set wheels in motion: Dementia is contagious. Just kidding, not kidding. Caregivers need to remember, sequence, execute millions of ADL tasks for self *and* for loved one. Self-concerns fall by the wayside as ""not urgent,"" ""not immediately contributing to loved one's care,"" ""too complex to add to an already cognitively and emotionally jangled mental load."" Lack of self care leads to lack of care for loved one, leads to lack of self-care… vicious cycle. 

God bless you for caring for the caregiver. My dad was similar, caring for wife & emotionally reserved & struggling with his own issues, and he was a total mess.
My dad found a class that he was able to take virtually through the local adult day care center. It was a HUGE help for him. He isn't the type to find a support group useful, and won't go to a therapist/counselor, and my mom is too clingy for him to be able to focus on a book for long.  The class was perfect. 

The class included video examples, a handout binder broken into sections like ""eating"", and a live instructor that was able to answer questions and also curtail some of the winding stories from other classmates. PM me if you want and I can share the local day care details - there may be something similar in your area.
I find it almost impossible to be able to join and attend a specific group, but have gotten a lot of great information from this YouTube Channel, which I can watch anytime it's convenient for me.

If he's financially stable, then hire an assistant to help out a few days/nights a week.  Nobody can be a care taker 24/7 and stay sane.  Not even the best of us.  Ask the nurse for a list of recommended care takers.  The nurse or the social worker can provide this.  Take care.  It's a tough job to take care of the dying but even harder when we love them.",2022-03-15 22:47:02,Magoonical,tf7fzu
Alzheimers,Could getting a diagnosis make my parent worse?,"Do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? That’s what I’m struggling with. My family and I can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad I worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. We’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. I am pushing to get it done but the more adamant I am about it, the more I wonder if it’s even the right choice. I have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly I don’t know what to think anymore. Thanks in advance for any advice.","No; a diagnosis will not affect the disease. It's biological. What I've had happen, though, is my loved one stopped trying to fake being neurotypical. She stopped nodding her head when she didn't have a clue in discussions. Stopped making excuses when she couldn't complete a simple task. In a word, she appears like someone with more pronounced dementia than previously. That's while she's around me. Hasn't quite stopped trying to put on a big old friendly grin and pretend everything is fine and dandy around people she doesn't know well. But around me she's starting to relax into what's actually happening in her mind and body. 

We talk about dementia—openly, gently, with respect. Having a diagnosis helps me know better how to help her maintain her dignity. Helps me learn strategies which would violate norms for neurotypical people, but that have now become helpful—completing her sentences, tying her shoes, asking ""do you understand,"" cutting her slack when she can't remember or do something. 

Thank you for your kindness to your father. I've set down my experiences; YMMV.
I get you’re worried your dad will feel sadder with a diagnosis, but in my case - my mom knew something was wrong with her, and it upset her not knowing why or what was going on. 

Now that we have a diagnosis, I think it helps her to have an explanation. 

Now when she gets upset because she can’t remember something, I tell her “Well mom, it’s because you have Alzheimer’s. It’s not your fault. The Alzheimer’s makes you forget.”  It weirdly calms her, I guess because there’s a reason for what’s happening, and knowing what it is in that moment might be helping her confusion.

I can tell you from my family’s experience, getting the diagnosis is the right choice. Once you have it, you can move forward and get information and help on what to do next.
It's not going to make it worse. It will get you some clarity around what's going on. And maybe, if you're lottery-winner lucky, you'll find out it's not Alz but something treatable. 

Odds are, though, they'll agree it's probably Alzheimers. And then you'll know, and that's better, because you then you can start to plan for what will come next. 

One side note worth mentioning: my mom was also called back for extra testing. At the advice of my BIL, an MD, my dad asked a lot of questions around what they were looking for specifically, and found out that particular neurologist wanted to enroll my mom in a very expensive drug trial.  The extra testing (which my parents would have paid for) only would have shown whether she was a candidate for that trial.  So... ask questions.
what sort of further testing do they want?  Neuropsych testing is pretty comprehensive.  If his neuropsych testing did not diagnose dementia then he may not have it. Severe depression can mimic dementia as well.
I experienced something similar to what you describe - I would just say treat it like it’s in your head … at the end of the day, your doing the best you can and make sound judgments while accounting for all evidence.

My moms second round of tests showed major decline, enough for the neuro-psych to say “most likely dementia”, and then no follow ups or anything (after a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and small vessel ischemic)

There are times when it seems like a diagnosis makes it worse, mom is relatively lucid and any diagnosis would be perceived by her as straight up gaslighting (hence she refused to see the neuro psych again anyway). But a couple hours later she may think she is in her childhood home and wondering where her parents are … 

In sum, I think the diagnosis is critical to get help in the system (I just changed her doctors so she will be more comfortable) - but it may also lead to a lot of crazy fighting (especially if they think they are fine, or constantly forget about the diagnosis).
With my one data point, I say no. I have tried changing things up numerous ways to try to manage and try to stay ahead of my wife’s decline. Her decline has been a constant steady progression. It seems like every week I noticed a subtle little thing she can’t now do. But her decline will seem more remarkable at times because it’s tied to milestones. When she can’t feed herself or use the restroom properly it seems significant, but I see the constant steady decline.

Staying on a constant schedule of sleep and meds seems to make for much better next days.",2022-03-15 16:39:19,HillbillyOfTheDesert,tezqvo

Alzheimers,Predatory Marriage Pt 3: Intervention and Escape,"In December, my father P (M 78) who has Stage 6 Alzheimers got engaged to be married to his girlfriend of 18 months (F 72) N, who had managed to isolate P from his friends and family and gain control over his finances. 

In early January, we learned that P & N were meeting P’s longtime accountant and another lawyer to rewrite his will to remove his children and grandchild and give everything he had to N. P had the original will written in 2019 shortly after receiving his diagnosis.

Although P had failed a capacity test in December and could no longer legally sign his new will or sign his Trust Fund over to her, he could still get married as the bar is very, very low. Despite his severe dementia, P still had many lucid moments and could seem totally fine for short periods.  

If P signed a marriage certificate, N would have legal control over his health decisions. It would also give her the cover she needed to drain away his financial resources in secrecy, a process she began even before the big day by redirecting the pension payments he received into a bank account she controlled. 

All N had to do is move him somewhere away from his meddling kids and take away his phone and he would be effectively incommunicado. We would never see him again and we wouldn’t even know when he died. 

Something had to be done. We started by emailing P’s large group of friends and telling them about N and what she was doing to P. They all responded with support for us and with love and concern for their friend. Scammers preying on the elderly in their community was nothing new to them. We also reached out to P’s accountant and found that he was greatly suspicious of N but stayed silent out of respect to his friend.

P’s friends and fam began to plan an intervention over Zoom. The idea was that his younger son J (M 51) &  daughter in law S (F 52) would go over to P's house, surprise P with a meeting with all of his friends who would then confront him about their concerns about N and her diabolical plan. 

After that, J would show P the evidence that they had learned from the background check that N was a Lonely Hearts romance scammer who had already been convicted of fraud years ago and had lied to him about her own financial situation, telling him she was “loaded” and did not need his money, despite having a huge tax lien on her house. 

They would also show P a [checklist ](https://maggiesresource.com/are-you-in-an-abusive-relationship-c110.php)of abusive behaviors to try to get him to see how terribly she was treating him. Once he was convinced, they would call the locksmith to have the locks changed, help him pack up his stuff, and drive off to a prearranged Airbnb out of state. 

Our worst fear was that N would somehow get wind of the plan and whisk him away for a quickie marriage. We also worried she may become physically abusive if he resisted her. Early on we had learned that N had quite a temper which worsened when she drank. What would she do if she learned her Golden Goose was going to break their engagement?

Timing was everything here. Thankfully, P's caregivers gave us a heads up that N was out of town that weekend and that she would not see him until she returned on Tuesday. J set the intervention for Monday.

When the day finally came, J arrived at P’s house to find that P had been primed by N to tell him that he no longer wanted his younger son in his life as he was interfering with his relationship with N. 

During the zoom meeting, P seemed unmoved, his face emotionless. His friends warned him N had proven to all involved that she was up to no good and implored him to break the engagement.  He said he had no plans to marry N (N wanted this kept secret!) but he was an adult and knew what he was doing. 

The zoom meeting ended in sadness and frustration.  It didn't seem like we had gotten through to him at all. 

About an hour later I received a text from my sister-in-law reading: on our way to Arizona with P!!

Apparently, P thought that N was a “wicked woman” (his words) but that he did not know how to break up with her. It would be a difficult situation for any person to realize they wanted to break up with a partner and take the necessary actions to do this, but for someone with dementia they may well be helpless. You can’t drive away, you can’t explain your feelings to people, you can’t call for help, you cannot defend yourself if the other person refuses to let you go. And the caregivers he lived with (as wonderful as they are) could not interfere. 

If J hadn’t persisted despite the emotional agony of having his Dad cut him off, this woman would have ruined him and his family.

The other thing we found was that P’s dementia was much much worse than we had known or suspected, despite the increasingly dire caregiver reports. Since our contact with him was increasingly limited to short visits and conversations after N arrived on the scene, we had not been able to grasp the severe decline in his memory and communication skills. N took advantage of P’s confusion over his own condition to convince him that he only had MCI (Moderate cognitive impairment - his initial diagnosis), which was vital in constructing a reality where she was simply marrying a man she loved and who loved her, instead of financially abusing someone dying of a neurodegenerative disorder.  

On the drive to the airbnb, J reported P had become incoherent after nightfall and kept asking them who they were and where they were going. They learned they needed to keep him out of the kitchen as he would wander around and touch all the knives and even play with the oven burners. It became clear they needed to get him into a care facility as soon as possible before P could endanger himself. Thankfully, even at his worst behavior, he continued to be a very sweet and loving person towards J & S. 

It would take about a month to get P examined by his doc and admitted into care. 

Until then, they had to keep a very active senior safe and happy in a relatively small space, arrange for a high quality yet affordable memory care, reconstruct P’s finances after N put them under her control and then trashed them, clean out P’s condo and arrange for sale, and do a FT WFH job.

Then the calls started. First, a man claiming to be a local police officer called asking if P was with J and could they speak to him? When asked his badge number he mumbled something and then hung up. 

P’s caregiver called: I know you told me not to tell N anything but she was so sad about P I had to tell her you were in AZ! 

J: How could we trust you with P? You are fired. 

Another call from LE in P’s county, this time the real thing. It seems that N reported P as a missing and endangered person, leading to them calling J and asking to speak to P. They asked if P was there under his own free will or being abused in any way.  P: Yes and no. Officer seemed satisfied. 

Then 3 days later another call from law enforcement, this time from J’s home county. The sheriffs were standing in front of J's door (they not home) and wanted entrance and to speak with P to verify his condition. This time J refused to allow them to speak to P, as he had already been checked on by LE - here is her badge number. They leave and don’t return. 

These LE calls were only the beginning of N’s harassment, and we now understand she won’t ever stop trying to get to her ex-fiance. But P is in a beautiful safe place now and seems very happy. He already has a bunch of new friends because he is still charming and handsome as ever. 

I hope this story helps anyone who cares for  a person who may be vulnerable to this kind of vile predation. We appreciate the supportive comments.","Wow, what a saga, and terrifying to realize there are people out there who will do this sort of thing. Thank you for sharing, and so glad your father is in a better place!
The very same thing happened to my friend's father. That lady cleaned him out, moved her son into his home and when the money she had access to was gone, so was she and her son. So sorry this happened but elated that you were able to rescue P!",2022-03-15 14:31:45,COMMODOREXXX,tew7rj
Alzheimers,Waited 18 hours for an ambulance that never came,"My dad became unwell yesterday - very high temp, extremely confused, unresponsive at times, unable to walk.  I called the GP who triaged over the phone and advised we call an ambulance as dad was deteriorating and needed hospital care. 

After 6 hours we called again and were told it would be several more hours. My parents live in a flat and we couldn't get dad up from the sofa, let alone down two flights of stairs in order to take him in ourselves. 

This morning I called the GP back in tears. He came to do a home visit and has decided that dad is ok to stay home under the care of the community team as his condition is improving. 

I'm relieved that dad seems to be better today but absolutely appalled. I work in the NHS but I've lost all faith that there's any support.","Wow, roller-coaster.

Alzheimers,Useless birthday celebrations,"Yesterday was my Mom's 64th birthday, and the first that she had absolutely no understanding of or context for. This milestone, although obviously inevitable, has probably been the most difficult yet.

In past posts and comments here I've used some pretty foul language to try to express my feelings about this disease, but right now even all those words and phrases seem so inadequate -- and probably worst yet, futile.  I hate this. Although I was never particularly close with my Mom, my heart breaks for my Dad -- her primary caretaker -- who must endure this trajedy day in and day out, as he helplessly watches the mind of his wife of 38 years completely disintegrate. 

I'm sorry, I have nothing constructive to add to the dialogue right now.  I just needed a cathartic vent.","It’s so awful for so many reasons to watch your parent not remember so many things, but to not be aware of special days like Birthdays is even harder. Keep on venting or whatever you need to do that helps you through this.

I hope you and your Dad are doing okay and are able to support each other. Take care of yourself the best you can.
We hear you and understand...
I am so sorry for your mom and certainly your dad. My wife was diagnosed approximately three weeks ago. She and I have been together for 30 years, I am 55 and she is 54 years old. I feel the same way you do, sad, a little bit uncertain. Not so mad but I am in the extreme early stages. What I do know is that music can be very helpful and make sure you do all the things that make her happy.

Hang in there- for this life can be painful but it can also bring joy to see hear and feel.
Yes, our birthday visit with my MIL this year was just terrible. She is so, so unhappy and there is nothing we can do. She couldn't really realize or care it was her birthday because the hallucinations and bathroom issues are all-encompassing.
We gave up on birthdays.  It just causes confusion and frustration.
You're correct....there are no adequate words to describe how much this disease sucks. My Grandma is the most amazing person I know. She helped anyone and everyone she could w/o judgement...her father was an emotionally absent, controlling narcissistic ass hole. My Grandpa, though great and caring in many ways, experienced a LOT of trauma as a child, and became an alcoholic. Was definitely not an easy man to be married to.  He unexpectedly passed away at 67 years old. Not too long after, my grandma was dx with Alzheimer's.  She finally was at a point she could do what she wanted, travel where she wanted, live her life w/o having to answer to anyone..... Alzheimer's took it all away.  (& COVID fast tracked it) Now my Mom is stressed with having to handle all of her medical & financial needs/decisions, while her last remaining sibling is zero help, complains about not being in charge of $$, is selfish, and second guesses every decision while giving zero constructive help, and undermines her whenever possible.  This disease destroys so much more than the person that has it.",2022-03-14 21:09:13,AestheticCopacetic,tecwap
Alzheimers,Free Cohort-based program for caregivers,"Hi everyone! I hope you’re all doing well. We are HelpMate, a company run by PhD and Master's students with a mission to help caregivers and people living with dementia navigate their post-diagnosis journey.

**What are we doing?**  
Currently we are gathering expressions of interest for our free pilot cohort-based program which aims to educate and upskill caregivers. The program will run for 4-weeks, comprising of a live session each week led by a specialist in the dementia space (GP, occupational therapist, nutritionist, nurse consultant, neuropsychologist) as well as hearing stories from people living with dementia and their caregivers. We are currently looking to start this inaugural cohort in late April/early May.

**Are you interested?**  
If you are a caregiver and are interested in being part of a tight-knit community of caregivers and want to upskill yourself, please fill in the form below and we will be in touch!

[https://airtable.com/shrPPWzu0ODUh7GBx](https://airtable.com/shrPPWzu0ODUh7GBx)

**Why us?**  
Our team has been navigating this space for months. We have spoken to over 50 different people including caregivers, people living with dementia, loved ones, clinicians, and academics and one thing was very clear to the team. We believe the dementia space lacks a medium for many new and existing families to learn about how to adapt to their new situation. It was also evident that for many families trying to find specific information for their situation, this can also be very difficult as dementia is different for every single person and family.

We hope to offer caregivers and their loved ones access to necessary information and surround them with a community of people who share their journey, with our cohort-based program.

Alzheimers,My Grandmother [80] is currently stuck on my home and wants to go to home but my dad doesn't want her to go home. Is this alright?,"My grandmother has been living alone for about 2 years and at that time more things have had happened that wad worrying as such.

AShe has gone away for 2 times already in which my father just bought an gps tracker for her so that she wont go again. Her hand got injured and got bloated because she fell down the stairs.

After this my dad was much more worried about my grandma, and made her stay here by lying to my grandma that she needs to wait for my uncle.

In the first few weeks it was fine and my uncle was able to come to our home again and again, but then in the fourth week or so my uncle left to go to america since he lives there nowadays. 

This became a problem for her to get distracted and to make her not leave our house, and the weeks were pretty sufferable since we always needed to distract her so that she can't go to her home.

This time it was different, it was today where she went out of our house and tried to go to her home. Surprisingly she was near the place and she could've actually gone home. 

Right now my grandma is arguing with my dad on trying to go home, she just wants to go home and me and my mom are very stressed about this situation because it is very irritating and since my mom is a baker, she always gets in the home. And my dad has had enough and had a mental breakdown about my grandma and surprisingly my grandma was fine about it and said sorry afterwards.

What do i do in this situation? I desperately need help because it is very stressing for my entire family and my mom wants to leave and rent an apartment somewhere so that she can work in a nice enviroment.

Please help.","Does your grandma have memory issues? can someone move in with her so she can be at her house?  if she really can’t live alone and she likes to bake, maybe try baking with her so she is supervised.  I am sorry I can’t be of much help. I Have more questions than answers.
I assume your grandmother has Alzheimer's Disease or something similar. There is a point where someone with that condition cannot live alone.  From what you described, she could be at that point.  I don't know where you live, but you could see if your local community has any daycare programs for someone like your grandmother. Then show your parents the options.

Alzheimers,Sudden facial expressions that appear to be astonishment.,"My friend is in memory care. I don't even know why because I'm not family but was told by a staff member that it was alcohol that caused this, but I think it was inappropriate of her to say so. It seems more parkinsonian in that he can barely use his frame anymore and his foot hurts constantly even though there seems to be nothing wrong with it (now) He badly injured his foot about 7 years ago but it looks fine and wouldn't prevent ambulation. His voice comes out in short bursts. He has no memory of the past and I've met people with alcoholic dementia that certainly do up to a certain point. They would also constantly confabulate or retell the same story. His only story is ""going to get a car today"". 

The last time I visited him before omicron lockdown I was sitting at the dining room table with him and on two occasions his face suddenly contorted into a look of astonishment (while looking at me). Both times his face went back to normal as soon as I started talking again. Any thoughts would be well appreciated.

Alzheimers,Hospice When Not Seemingly Close to Death?,"It's been a rough couple of weeks with my mom (64 F). The week before last, she was stuck at home with me because she developed a skin infection on her butt from her nighttime fecal incontinence, and couldn't go to daycare because they wouldn't administer the medication she needed to treat it. On Thursday this past week, daycare called me to let me know that my mom was having a really difficult time and complaining of pain in her legs, crying more than usual and just not herself. ""Okay,"" I thought, I'll take her to urgent care when I pick her up. Well, when I picked her up that day, they came out with three bags of clothes saying that she peed through her clothes I sent her in, her spare clothes, and walked out wearing pants that were loaners. It was suggested they thought maybe she had a UTI and that might be why she wasn't seeming like herself. The problem there was, she had not been exhibiting any UTI symptoms at home. Urgent care ended up not being an option because they all need appointments, and the only clinic that takes walk ins is closed now for the foreseeable future after an electrical fire that happened the week we were there for her skin infection. So the only option was the ER.

They got her triaged and we waited in the waiting room for a couple of hours before she started sundowning and just would not stop crying over every little thing. The sundowning actually ended up saving us, because we were able to get her into a bed faster, and who knows how long we would have continued to wait if I didn't bring it up.

So we get her into the room, they cath her and say she has the cleanest sample they've seen in awhile, no UTI. No real explanation for her pain and exacerbated cognitive state. The pain is so difficult to help her with, because in the previous occasions I've had her seen for pain, it's really hard to pinpoint what's real and what's phantom, and then usually she's fine, but something does seem to be off. She screams as if I'm going to kill her when I try to swing her legs out to get her out of bed, or when I need to try and get her to sit up straight in bed, rather than hunched over to her right, or straining her neck, which will actually end up hurting her.

Anyway, the ER doctor was really sweet and talking to me about life with her as it is now, and suggested looking into getting a hospice referral from her PCP. Hospice had been suggested to me by a family friend, and that my mom doesn't actually have to be knocking on death's door, that we may be able to get the extra help just for comfort care. After the past two weeks, I feel like maybe these smaller conditions have just progressed her Alzheimer's further, and it might just be the disease pushing her into a new stage (she's already progressed so fast this past year, and has been settled in moderate to severe over mild since after she moved in with me last February).

I kept mom home with me on Friday just because we were up way later than she's used to while at the ER for hours, and I wanted to make sure she got some rest. Well, Friday morning after she woke up, she was really unsteady and unbalanced when trying to get her into the bathroom to change her, and she fell. I could not get her up. I could not get her to understand how I needed her to help me help her get up. She was too preoccupied with the fuzz on the carpet or with her shirt. When she was a caregiver for a man with Alzheimer's before she developed her own symptoms, the man she cared for fell all the time (not hard falls, usually he'd slip out of his recliner), and my mom could never get him up. The man's daughter told my mom she just had to call 911 each time he fell to have EMS come pick him back up. It got to the point that EMS told my mom that if she called one more time, she'd be reported for elder abuse and negligence. So imagine my immense dilemma when trying to decide if I needed to do the same. I did though, the guys who came were all great, and they were in and out in less than 10 minutes. But now I completely understand why my mom needed the extra help with the man she cared for.

I'm thinking hospice might definitely be something I want to look into, but I was hoping to get any perspective from those of you who may have had similar experiences with hospice. Any input, general information I might not know, suggestions or advice you may be able to offer would be really helpful! I'm also looking now into either a rollator or a wheelchair for her at this point, because the last thing I need is her falling at home, but also when we're not at home or she's at daycare. That's also kind of difficult to reconcile, because if she is at the point where she's not going to walk anymore, it's just going to make caring for her until I can get her into memory care, 10x more difficult, and it means that she is becoming further and further from who she used to be.","Hi OP, I'm really sorry about what you are going through. I'm just going to share my experience with my dad, Alzheimer's and hospice. We had moved my dad in to memory care February 2021. In September, my dad started having some aggression issues and violent outbursts. We tried really hard to get a geriatric psych eval but nobody was open due to COVID. By late October, his facility told us we needed to find him a new place. Unfortunately nowhere in the entire state would consider taking a man with ""behaviors"". We began looking out of state. 

I had been asking about hospice for a couple months and they finally agreed he should be evaluated for it. They told me in order to qualify for hospice, they have to have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. Hospice came the following day to evaluate my dad and decided he qualified. They started him on dilaudid. It did not slow him down one bit; he was up and motoring around. We finally found him a new facility that would take him and very fortunately it was just a few miles down the road. We moved him in and the new place seemed great and much better equipped to handle my dad. I visited him a few times and they had a family Thanksgiving gathering. I had no idea that would be the last time I'd see him. My dad passed the day after Thanksgiving and caught even hospice off-guard. I got a call that they thought he was transitioning to actively dying but I didn't need to rush down. 20 minutes later I got a call back to say that he'd passed. My dad was on hospice just under a month before he passed. 

The point of this is that things can go so much differently than you expect. It's worth an ask. Their job is to help your mom feel better and be comfortable. I'll be thinking about you, OP.
Geriatric social worker here. If your mom qualifies for hospice, go for it. Get the care. Get the nurse visits. Get the social worker visits. Get the chaplain and the art therapy and the volunteers and the pet therapy. Welcome them to your home. Get the relationships. Get the help. 

In 6 months, if she qualifies again, awesome. If she doesn’t, you’ll have all these people from that hospice who know you and your mom who will be able to make recommendations on what to do next. But it’s likely she will re-qualify, because alz is progressive, and she’s not likely to get better. 

I work in a nursing home and one of the biggest misconceptions about hospice is that the patient needs to be “knocking on deaths door.”  They don’t! Instead of getting help and care and support, the family puts it off until the person is LITERALLY dying, and then they have all these hospice strangers trampling in to help, which is weird and awkward when the family just wants to be with their mom.
Hi OP! EMT here. If you can’t pick her up without help, we will happily help you. We understand that the disease puts her more at risk for falls. You are one person, you can only do so much. If it does get to the point where we are being called too often, we won’t threaten you. We will have a conversation to make sure you can find the appropriate resources for your mom.
thanks for sharing, sorry i don't really have anything concrete to add. 

i've read plenty of people's stories where they put their loved ones into a facility that specializes with memory care. do you have something like that in your vicinity? essentially, if you aren't capable of taking care of her yourself, you should think about it to lighten your load. 

where i'm from, we pretty much only have one hospice in the whole country (less than 2 mil pop though), but it's very much for actually dying people, mostly cancer. most elderly homes offer extra care for people with dementia (basically the more help you need, the more it costs). 

your story made me realize i need to take care of some holding bars around the bathroom for grandma asap.
Get the help. listen when it comes to dementia, there is no real downside to hospice. You get more support, and there aren't any medications you really cut, not the same way as cancer meds. My grandmother was in a similar way after she broke her hip. Never bounced back. We got her signed onto hospice in mid-Jan. She was still up and walking around, with a lot of help (lifting up onto feet with gait belt, one person in front and behind, and a walker). Even as we got her out of bed and worked harder at the heavy lifting trying to ""exercise"", she eventually was not able to take a step from standing, then could put her feet flat on the floor. Then she could not bring her hand holding food, to her mouth. She passed last week. We absolutely would not have been able to handle these fast drastic changes without the support of hospice. EVERYONE says, they wish they started it sooner.
I recently found out that people with dementia are eligible for hospice at a certain point, because it is a terminal illness-it does not necessarily mean they are close to death. You should def take advantage of the help! They are another pair of hands (and heart) to care for your loved one and take a little pressure off of you. They have a lot of experience, give great advice, and are not only there to care for the physical/emotional needs of your loved one with dementia, they are also there to care for the needs of family members. It’s a great program, I can’t recommend it enough. Best of luck.
From what i understand a doc has to be the one to sign off on her being eligible for hospice care. They do it based on a reasonable expectation that the person has 6 months or less to live. My dad ended being on it for many years. That said, people were telling me he had less than a year, every year, for well over a decade. When he got hospice care it was very helpful. He got a medical bed to help him sit up, wheelchair and other medical equip to help keep him clean. Also nice to have access to home nursing. 

Just because mom is eligible doesn't mean you have to use hospice. You can also pull her out at any time, and to put her back on it, the doc just has to approve, which im told is easy to get. 

I would 100% look into this. Leave it up to doc to decide, and tell them everything. If she's not eligible then thats that. Ask about signs to look for when she will be. If she is eligible, id definitely look into all the options for starting up.",2022-03-13 16:11:45,shady-pines-ma,tdfby0
Alzheimers,Black and Blue Legs,"My grandmother is in her final stage of Alzheimer’s disease. She hardly moves and is bedridden. Her nurse sent a picture of her legs with mottling creeping up from her feet - said she would probably be with us for another two days.

My mom, my husband, and I went to go see her. My mom sees her frequently, but this is the first time I’ve seen her since January. She’s extremely frail, almost corpse-like.

After my husband and I got home, my mom calls saying she checked grandma’s legs and the colors has gone away. Has anyone experienced this with their loved one?","Yes, and unfortunately it may last much longer than 2 days....try 2 years unless of course the nursing home is planning on ""helping along the transition process."" My mom is 87 and has had dementia since at least early 2006 and is now at stage 7 for over 5 years. She lost the ability to walk and stand about 16 months ago, and has been bedridden ever since. She started to develop bedsores last summer until we got a hospital bed, and the in home care nurse helped treat and heal her wounds. Her arms and legs have also become immobile since that time and she was wasn't expected to make it to 2022 per her own doctor.

If you would have seen her at any point in the last 6 months you would have been convinced she had only a couple weeks left to live. She can barely even move her head now and only mumbles about a dozen nonsensical words throughout the day. Alzheimer's is a cruel disease and the only blessing may be that the patient has no idea what's going on anymore and doesn't remember anything from more than 2 minutes in the past. We know she is very close to the end of her life, but we have literally been saying that since the end of 2020.",2022-03-13 01:16:47,bearchildd,td0nrb
Alzheimers,Feeling overwhelmed with taking care of assets,"My dad has been in assisted living for a short while now, and that is going great. 

The problem is everything else that remains.

My sister and I need to prepare his house and its contents for auction/sale. Of course, there are some things we both want in the house, and there are the feelings I have to wrangle with of “Should I keep this or not?” It’s like dealing with someone’s house after they have died. 

I’m overwhelmed. I just want to get this task over with and move on, but it feels like there’s so much to do. I live three hours away and have my own family, so it feels like an impossible task. 

I suppose I’m just venting. I truly hate all of this.","Did the same with my mothers house. If it has no real sentimental value and I mean “no real” do not keep it. Set up 3 areas of a room. Make a keep pile, a sell pile (estate sale, let go, etc), and a donate pile. The donation pile helped a lot with making decisions on things because I knew at least someone else could use it and it would do some good. Once you start going you will be surprised how little you will keep and how fast the process moves. It sounds absurd to say this in this sub but many times I did not keep stuff because I said to myself that the memory of what was behind keeping the object was more important than the object itself. Good luck
Vent away. It helps. I still have boxes of my mom's things even though we emptied her house years ago and she passed away in December. I'm stuck with things that I don't want, but I know she cherished them. This is just how it goes sometimes.
I'm in the same boat and totally feel you. We just put my dad in memory care a couple weeks ago and I'm so stressed about his house and all the crap he (and my mom) accumulated over the years.

I'm curious what everyone did when it comes to photographs. There are so many and I don't want all of them but I feel so guilty throwing them away.
There are people who, for a fee, will go through all that stuff and hold an estate sale.  That might not be the avenue you choose, but be aware that it exists.  A senior center or local realtor could probably put you in touch with one.

Others have commented on the keep/toss/donate strategy.  I've done that too, it's just that there's so much!  My approach to big chores is break it down into manageable increments and keep going back to it when possible.

Since you live 3 hours away, you might put a couple cartons in your car with every trip and work on decisions from your home base.
Right where I am, too. My dad went into a facility two weeks ago.

The kicker is we got a practice run. My dad had been keeping HIS dad's house for 15+ years his death. Was 'cleaning it out' on his monthly and then twice-yearly trips across a couple states.

Last April, I saw my dad's condition and knew we had to get this house sold, so I got my brother and my dad on board (my dad was a bit resistant but knew deep down he couldn't hold onto the house forever) and planned a four-day trip to 'finish cleaning the house out.' Had a realtor all set up.

When I arrived it looked exactly the same as I remembered last time I visited like 10 years ago. Some items cleaned, but mostly still a fully-crammed house full of stuff.

We spent those four days frantically tossing, donating, and packing what we wanted to keep to take back home. Packed a 40-yard dumpster to its gills. Did a LOT of emotional work with my dad trying to get rid of some stuff or get him to realize he HAS to take things back to his house. Apparently he had just been treating this house like his little vacation spot, because it was his childhood home. And he was advanced enough he kept forgetting we were CLEANING IT OUT so he kept taking stuff out of the dumpster and like, putting it back 'where it goes' in his old bedroom.

Now it almost feels easier this time around because I'm practiced and he is not there to have to guide through things. But it hit me in the stomach when we walked in after moving him to the facility and his living room still had the large stack of untouched boxes of the stuff he packed from his own dad's house not even one full year ago.
Vent away! It certainly helps me to read about how other families deal with this.

My sister overpaid a cleaning/estate sale service to go thru our parents' house for us. We walked through together (I brought my best friend for moral support) and removed things we wanted. Things we both wanted we took to my sister's (she lives close by) for further discussion. It's easy for us because I live in a different country, that limited what I could take home. But paying a service to do the bulk work did a lot to help maintain a good relationship with my sister. I did have to sacrifice some small items to her crazy, and ultimately my friend just started putting some of my mom's knickknacks straight into her purse (my mom is still alive and now in assisted living) so my sister wouldn't keep them. My mom just put those things in a drawer so who knows if it was worth the subterfuge. At least she has some of her familiar things if she want them, I suppose.
Be thankful you have a someone to help, I had to do this alone.  Although, I did not have the added “I want that” headache with a sibling. I started by doing many many runs to goodwill but just ended up getting a dumpster. I felt bad about trashing useful items, but it would have taken weeks and no charity would pick up. An estate sale would have ended up costing more than the dumpster since I, of course, kept anything of value. 

But, I don’t want to freak you out or anything, the house clearing was the easiest part of my Alzheimer’s caregiving experience.  That is something that could be done and accomplished.
I'm in the same, same, same situation ahhh

I'm in front of his new home now, texting my sister, about to check in, thinking about how in a week ill be on the floor of his house hours away going through boxes.

And my sister is NO help 😤 (her having a new baby and also being in another part of the country is a pretty good excuse though)

You and I and all of us will get through this, because our parents would have if they were in our position
I hired a junk removal service and moved the sentimental/valuables to a storage unit. Hired a relator and got that baby sold. You’ll feel so much better when it’s done and you’ll hopefully have some profit from the sale to be able to to help fund assisted living facility costs.
I know how you feel. To me it feels like a violation of their property, since my mother is still living in nursing care. It took me a while to even go there and have a look at what needed doing.

If it wasn't for my daughters I would still be stuck. I opened a shed door yesterday and just stood there crying. WHY did they keep so much junk? 

We have one room to put all the household items in for sale as we go through each room, cupboard drawer methodically. We are making progress, but everything looks like a huge mess at the moment. We will hold a garage sale to get rid of what we can, use FB marketplace for any items left and then call a charity to bring their truck. 

My biggest problem is getting rid of the clothes. All the donation bins are still full most of the time thanks to the Great ovid Cleanout everyone seems to have had, and the charity shops no longer want things. If worse comes to worse it will have to go to landfill but I would rather not have to do that.
when my grandpa died (of cancer), i did most of the cleaning. just throw away indiscriminately, keep the items that spark joy (go watch the marie kondo thing on netflix, if you haven't yet) and have fun exploring your father's life (found a bunch of documents from grandpa, like his college grades, some cool letters from his work, a state commendation, stuff like that). 

keep some clothes you can wear, that's my favourite memento, because i actually use it often (kept a couple of shirts).
I have a garage full of stuff I can't part with. Maybe we should switch houses and clean each other's parents' stuff. I think I just created a new reality show.
You know how you eat an elephant? In small bites.
My brothers and I will likely be having to do this too in the near future and I dread it, I can see how you would be overwhelmed. You will get through this hang in there 🤍",2022-03-13 09:32:12,CarelessWhiskerer,td6zmp
Alzheimers,"Dunno where else to put this, trying to create/buy perfect gift for my great grandmother","My great grandmother, recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, was very fond of her two dogs, a pug and a corgi, however she couldn’t take care of them after the dead of my great grandfather, and has been living alone ever since. I was looking for robotic pets she doesn’t need to take care of, and saw two nice brands. Perfect petzzz and joy for all. Anyone know if there’s some hybrid with realistic breathing and sleeeping and the same functions as joy for that’s a pug or a corgi? Set aside 180 pounds for this, hoping I can give the dog to her before her birthday of April 28.","I would think just a nice cuddly stuffed dog would be great. I am going to visit my Mom in memory care and was thinking of getting her a stuffed cat toy as she always loved cats. Your live, time and caring is your greatest gift. I have seen some folks in memory care with stuffed animals that they hold and love on.
I know its a recent diagnosis and you want to do something nice, but id be a little cautious with a pricey niche gift like this. Its possible the other commenter is right, your time (or maybe your assistance to her primary caregiver) would *probably* be the better gift now, unless you 100% know shes going to love it, or itll have a great return policy. 

I say this bc its hard to tell what they will like. i got my alz grandma a stuffed dog that looked *realistic* and like a dog she used to have, around the same time i got her a baby doll that looked like a life-size toy.. she thought the *doll was real* and coddled it like a real baby, but was angry and offended that i would give her a toy dog doll. I had to return it. 
On top of that she did love the baby but it gave her a little bit of anxiety because she was afraid of waking it all the time. 

I would consider hunting down or creating a collection of music she likes, from when she was in her teens to 30s, in a medium she can manage playback with alone.

In any case good luck, its nice you want to be nice.
My mum has a sleeping breathing dog toy.  She prefers the more ordinary but lifelike soft toy dogs.  She cuddles and talks to them..and it doesn't matter if they fall on the floor or get a bit messy..
The best gift you can give her is time. Do things like take her on long walks (if she is capable of doing so).
i feel like my grandma would be offended, if i brought her a toy dog (although she doesn't like animals as it is), because she'd still know it's a toy dog. 

i did encounter articles about pets helping a bunch and i am interested in having a dog myself, although grandma is resistant at this point. 

i'll keep these robotic pets in mind, thanks for bringing it up!",2022-03-12 16:56:01,BakedPotato4400,tcrv4s
Alzheimers,"My grandmother had Alzheimer's. My mother has Alz. Does Alz generally pass down through females or as a male, do I have a chance of getting it?",,"https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/causes-and-risk-factors/genetics

Hopefully this will help give you a good answer.
None of the major risk genes for Alzheimer's are in the sex chromosomes, so females can pass those genes to male offspring just as well as they can to female offspring.

That said, Alzheimer's is approximately twice as common in females than males.
How old were they when they became ill? Elderly Alzheimer's is not hereditary. Young-onset Alzheimer's is/can be genetic. 

Most Alzheimer's patients are elderly. Also, women live longer than men on average. Men are likely to die younger of other causes before elderly Alzheimer's starts to happen.",2022-03-12 13:09:27,Tomomori79,tcn81k
Alzheimers,Topic I’d like to avoid: Toenails,"How do you handle this? My dad (alz, mid-way-ish through disease process) has diseased toenails that are difficult to manage. Should I have a medical professional assist in trimming every 2 weeks? It’s painful for him, but I’m always worried about possible infection. 

Additionally, best shoes for alz. He has these no-tie sketchers but they’re getting harder for him to push on. Maybe crocs? 

Edit: thank you everyone!!","Think he’d be up for a pedicure? I take my mom in when I visit every few weeks. It’s a huge help and the team at her local salon is amazing. It has become a nice socialization thing for her. 
Or if you think they’re really diseased maybe a podiatrist could clean things up first, and then they’d be easier to manage?

Following for shoe recommendations.
Podiatrist/chiropodist home visits - they can treat and cut his nails. 

Crocs for outdoors, rubber soled velcro slippers for indoors.
Get a podiatry home visit every few weeks. Gran is less squeamish when they do it. Also has the added bonus that she perks up a bit with someone else to talk too. 
She wears sandals round the house that are easy to wear but can get cold.
There are travel nurses at home specific for foot care. Sounds like what you need here.
my grandmother is doing very well with birkenstocks made from eva foam, try the arizona model. you can probably also find ones with nonslip soles. very comfy, clean very easily (i wear them myself as well).

we don't do her nails every two weeks, they grow way slower than mine do. she's 88 though, so your experience might be different. she doesn't want to go to a salon, but she enjoys when i do her feet. 

i first soak her feet in hot water with salt (very salty, probably around twice the amount as i would use for pasta), squeeze of lemon juice (you can use any other acid on hand) and a pump of soap. 30 minutes is a nice time, but the water is gonna get cold, so check in-between. i got the recipe from a friend that does old lady's nails and feet professionally. 

after the soak, i first scrub her feet with that black sandpaper thing (i don't even know what's it called in my own language :D) and remove any harder stuff with a rougher stone. sometimes she gets these little blister like things on the tips of her toes. 

then i clip what i can, her big toes probably have fungal infections because they are very thick and crumbly, but that was before i started taking care of her, so it's probably too far gone to really do anything about it. it doesn't bother her, she doesn't leave the house that much, so it's not really an issue. i'd recommend good clippers, the big ones that kinda look like pliers are a lifesaver with the thick nails. 

for the end, i use a good foot cream and that's that. i used to do it every couple of days, because her soles were shot (really dry, flaking all over, she also has light diabetes, so that was a worry, etc.), but now that we got it to an acceptable level, we do it once a month or so.
We had the same problem! Took him to the podiatrist, and they cut his toenails, recommended some fungal cream, and gave us a list of people who can do monthly maintenance for him, including people who could go to where he lives (in memory care).
Get him the meds if his doctor says it’s ok.  In 3 months his nails will be better.
My mum goes to a podiatrist and my dad goes to. My mum is the one with Alzheimer's but dad goes with mum and they both have their apps so mum is more comfortable. Before that I was cutting her nails and doing fungal nail treatment for her.
We just did a foot bath this week, then I trimmed her nails. We used to do it monthly, but hadn't for several months recently. I could tell a difference, as she didn't want to leave her feet in the water for 20 minutes and kept taking one out, so I started after 10 minutes.

When she was more lucid, she asked to go to a podiatrist to get her nails trimmed. I had never heard of that and thought it was weird, to but her sister told me that is a normal thing.

I too use the pliers type clippers. I had seen them at pedicures before, but my grandmother bought them at Walmart. Those are the ones I have the best luck with. Still had some trouble this time around.

I don't know about shoes. When she goes out, a rare thing, she usually wears a pair of my Easy Spirits that zip up. They were too tight on me, to do I had given them to my grandmother who wore a size smaller. I bought some men's memory form slippers that are warm and big enough, but turns out they slide off the hardwood floors something awful. Struggled to put on her winter boots yesterday and could not zip them up. I guess she'll need a larger size or different style in the future.
i just go to the nail salon and leave a big tip (like $10-20), which is double or more than what they charge for a trim.... just so they don't hate us going in.",2022-03-12 10:27:01,jane_doe4real,tciokr

Her condition now is really bad and she doesnt have any common sense and manner at all, she can hardly be concious at things and even if I call her mutiple times she wont reply. But lately my brothers turned some sort of buddhism audio for her at night while she slept, I'm an atheist so I dont care about much but then he had to stop because my dad didn't want to involve in religious stuffs (yeah that's audio was kinda spooky for real). After  a few days, one night, it was like 1 am or something, I heard she was mumbling, normally when my mom sleeps, she has somniloquy so i just think that she is sleep talking but then I came closer I realised that she woke up and looked just like the first stage of alzheimer. She remembered me, remembered normal manners, remembered how to calculate and I asked her to sign her name-which she normally can't do, she did, of course sometimes she still mistook things but I surprised that she was concious and looked normal. But when she be able to read the clock and tell the time, she had to sleep and I was kinda afraid that if she sleep, things would be back to normal, and they sure were. But it was still strange how she turned from a person with barely any memories to one who acted normally and I was shocked. Have anyone met this situation before??????","Yes have had a relatively similar experience.

I was eating with my mom and she basically just turned to me and said “I know I have Alzheimer’s and it’s really scary.” I asked if she wanted a hug and she said yes, then followed it up with that she’s proud of me and my two brothers. 

This was way past the time of her realizing she was sick - it was really shocking. 

Looking back in it I’m glad it happened, it was a nice interaction and I haven’t had a good one since really. At the time though, it was super unnerving and really freaked me out.
it's not really about atheism/religion 

it's about the physical affect of the sounds and frequencies on the brain

it sounds like a chunk of her personality is still in there and it just got unlocked for a bit...which is cool...play her some more audio!
It's pretty common, I think. I've heard it described as like a light bulb that's poorly connected; it's out a lot of the time, sometimes it flickers, and sometimes it connects and shines brightly.
Wow! Do you have a link or anything to the audio that was played?
This is actually a somewhat common phenomenon, and can be triggered by almost anything. Music certainly is a great therapy, especially classical music like Beethoven, so it’s worth while to explore different musical genres. I’ve seen these “moments of clarity” over my several years of being a caregiver, and it’s quite spectacular to witness. But people should tame their hopes and expectations that these moments can be repeated and/or extended. Continued socialization, music, dietary changes, etc, can all contribute to reducing or slowly down the effects of the disease.
How amazing! That must have been nice to have your mom back for a bit.
Here’s a Buddhist rhythm to try. My grandma with Alzheimer’s would always respond when I played guitar or chanted this mantra https://youtu.be/yEGA4EBSZAE

Alzheimers,Advice? Dad has early on-set Alzheimer's,"This last year my father's mental condition has been deteriorating. He's in his early fifties and so young to be dealing with this. This week my father drove into another town, and was lost and confused as to why he was there. He was really scared. It's the first time something quite like this has happened. It's been really difficult watching such a capable person lose pieces of himself this way. 

I don't know what to expect the process to look like, how to comfort him, and how to handle my own emotions during this. It's scary and feels like too much. Those who've been in my place for longer, how do you cope during the progression?","Get power of attorney sorted out now, and I mean now. If your dad gets declared as lacking capacity, he can no longer sign to appoint one. Then you have a lengthy, complicated and expensive legal procedure to get it done. Trust me, that is what I am going through right now.
This is almost EXACTLY what happened to my dad, except he was early 60s when it started.

He was driving between cities and would start getting REALLY lost a lot. Had to call sheriffs a few times and had a few hospital visits. My dad was quite stubborn and insisted nothing was wrong, but I managed to get durable POA set up to help him with this big transaction he was confused on. He probably didn't understand he was signing a durable POA. His lawyer didn't question it. I don't think I did anything wrong because it REALLY needed to happen.

I second and then immediately third the notion to get durable POA right away. It saved the bacon of everybody involved when he finally ended up in the hospital and they wouldn't release him except to a memory care facility.

I then would say if he lets you, use the POA to get his affairs in order when you can still ask him questions. I'm scrambling to piece his life together with full POA and it's basically one big mystery novel because he can't provide ANY answers anymore.

Emotionally, well, it sucks the big one. Every time he loses something new it's a whole new layer of grief, and a whole new wave of 'I'm losing the father I had.' Give yourself permission and time to be experiencing wave after wave after wave of grief, and enjoy the moments you still have with the parts of his brain/personality you are still familiar with.
My dad just passed away from Alzheimer’s, he lived with it for almost a decade. As another commenter said, get power of attorney as that will allow for you or your mom to make important decisions for him. Care is extremely expensive especially down the road, so I would try to get financials in order if at all possible. The way to get Medicaid to pay for care is to spend down your assets to the point where it appears you have less money than you do, I.e. buying a house or car. Down the line you’ll want to get in touch with an elder care attorney as they specialize in this stuff. Spend time with him and get him moving and seeing old friends as those things just get harder as time goes by, but don’t feel guilty if it’s hard for you to be around him a lot because it’s simply depressing. It’s normal. I wish you the best of luck.
Being a caretaker for your parents is one of the most difficult and also rewarding things you can do.  Fill your mind and soul with patience, compassion and love. Focus your energy on keeping dad happy and try not to focus on the past as his condition progresses. When/if he becomes angry, rude, impatient or unreasonable remember it's not him being a jerk it's the disease. Take lots of pictures and videos of good times and bad ones too. They become great tools for reflection and learning.
This happened to my mom. She was 52 when she was diagnosed. 
Get your power of attorney in order and before he is too far gone make sure that he has nothing in his name: homes, cars, access to accounts. We hired a lawyer for this. 
We were able to get my mom on Medicare and no one went after my dad for money for medical stuff. 
My mom is now 57, and she lived in a nursing home, she couldn’t be left alone while my dad went to work anymore, it’s hard but eventually it becomes the normal. 
Feel free to reach out of you have questions.
Take some time off for yourself _now_ before he gets worse. Just go somewhere and enjoy the solitude while you can.
I've dealt with alzheimer's most of my life. First with my grandmother, who declined quite rapidly throughout my high school years, and then my father, whose stroke got the ball rolling in the same year my grandmother passed. 

The number one thing I can tell you is to have patience, and when he gets combative or starts not recognizing you, keep in mind that those moments are not him, it's the disease. 

Second, power of attorney is EXCEPTIONALLY important.  All the upcoming doctors visits and legal struggles will be made ten times easier if you have POA. My mom had POA over my dad, and it was like pulling teeth to try and get her to do anything because she didn't want to admit he was declining either. When he passed in 2016, she absolutely shut down and I had to make all the decisions anyway, but had to string her along to sign paperwork.

Third, show him old videos if you have any, but also take new ones. Ask him about his childhood. Ask him to tell you stories from his life. Cherish those memories. Good luck in the years to come. 💜
You or another family member should go to a doctor's appointment with your dad to ""discuss the incident of finding himself in another town.""  Something like that happened with my DH and the doctor promptly said ""You need to give up driving.""  This is huge - most men don't like giving that up (women too, but it seems a bigger deal to men) and having the doctor say it may be the thing that makes it happen.  

A person with dementia not only endangers himself but others.  It's no laughing matter.

As for you coping - are you his primary caregiver?  If you are, or are going to be transitioning into that role - I strongly suggest you find a dementia caregiver support group.  It helps you cope with your feelings as well as learn a lot of necessary tips for helping your dad.
Get an elder law attorney. Get durable POA, **NOW**. You need the attorney to arrange his assets so that he will be eligible for a Medicaid waiver home care and nursing home eventually, without draining the inheritance entirely. Does he have a diagnosis yet? If he does not, you may be able to purchase a long-term care insurance plan. He is quite young and if he is also physically healthy, he may live with this for 15 or 20 years.

**If you modify your base assumptions and expectations to set up a good environment for him, he can have a normal-feeling life for a long time.** And reach out for help when problems arise instead of trying to DIY until a crisis lands him in the hospital. Because every injury and hospitalization (especially if surgery, bed rest healing time, and residential PT rehab is required) will make basic tasks require more help, which accelerates dementia. Also, test him for hearing loss. If he has unaddressed hearing loss and does not address it with hearing aids, he will suffer cognitive decline faster as it becomes difficult for him to have interesting, nuanced, detailed conversations, and his brain gets less stimulation.

For example, he needs to be living in a disability-accessible, walkable community ASAP. He must not be living in a home that requires him to drive if he wants to leave the house and do anything. He must have a roll-in shower, a bathroom that can take a shower bench. No stairs, non-slip floors. All these will make it easier for him to live without heavy assistance, longer. Later on, it becomes extremely hard to disrupt their living habits because they cannot form new habits.

He is still young and early enough that he can form new muscle memories around the home that he will live in. But the home has to be safe. If he can walk to shops without driving, he will be able to socialize, run low-risk errands, and feel normal for a very long time.
thank you all for the advice. the POA situation will definitely be a priority once it's all official. i should clarify there are a couple tests they need to do first, but yes, his doctors are fairly sure that this is what we're dealing with.

 i really liked everyones suggestions of memory documentation, since there's already so much for him that isn't the same and it feels like every month its a little worse. i find comfort just in knowing that others understand how this all feels and how confusing it is, for the family, but also the one diagnosed.
Like others said get both POAs. Find the insurance policies, car titles, passwords and any other important documents. If you can get in his bank account and get autodrafts set up to pay his bills.

You should take some videos of him now too. I wish I had taken some of my wife when she was better.

This is a long sad road.",2022-03-09 23:52:19,analogsquared,taqv3u
Alzheimers,Transitioning into Memory Care,"First I wanted to say this subreddit has been very supportive getting to hear everyone's stories/tips. I know many caregivers or loved ones can feel alone in the experience but this place helps. 

My wife and I are finally moving forward this year to move my mother in law into a facility. Wife was adopted and hence why we are both pretty young (31) caretakers. MIL is turning 80 this Saturday and was diagnosed about 6 years ago. We have been the primary caretakers of her and have stayed with her this whole time. There have been so many ups and downs, but to see this amazing strong woman slowly degrade has been heartbreaking. She was a professional violinist who played for the Chicago Symphony/Chicago lyric opera. She is remarkably physically healthy for an 80 year. We have mentioned the change to her about moving to a assisted living place/memory care before. We described it as a place where she can make friends and do fun activities. She was always hostile towards the idea however and was adamant she would rather go live with family in Europe than go. There is no family in Europe that can take care of her but its one of those ideas that stuck with her. We are really all she has left. We have had visiting angels come and stay with her for a few hours during the day when me and my wife are working. That situation worked fine but was always temporary solution. We feel guilty moving forward with this decision but my wife and I would like to start a family of our own. Being a caretaker and raising a child would be immensely stressful. We have toured a great new place about 8 mins from us which has multiple levels of memory care offered. We have also have gotten an elder care attorney to try and maximize her money for her care. She has been in the middle stages for the last few years and is still able to do a lot of things on her own as long as long as its confined to her normal daily routine. We are not sure when this year it will happen but wanted to see how peoples experience it was moving your loved ones into a place. Any tips to make it easier or to prepare? I know it will be one of the hardest things we do.","You just have to be firm and steadfast in your insistance.  Let her visit a few places with you for a tour or a free lunch.  The better companies really have a lot of nice things, maybe she will see a piano in the lobby and get pulled in.

The more you waver, the harder this will be.  Also, don't telegraph any guilt vibes when you discuss it with her.
Hi. just want to say, you’re doing everything remarkably well. The way you are doing each item is the best way possible. 

I have no advice to give you in this situation since we did not do memory care; we went straight from home care to to assisted living, then home care during covid, rehab after injury twice, then home hospice. 

I know people have used Adult Day care but I don’t have direct experience with that.
Hey op! First off you are doing amazing! Be proud of yourself to recognize that you and your wife want to live your lives. That’s not an easy decision to make.

My grandma moved into assisted living about a month or 2 ago. She is in late stage 2, early 3 where she requires a lot of assistance but doesn’t understand how much assistance she requires. (IE she can’t cook, needs constant reminders for hygiene health, only answers phone calls and can no longer dial anyone back, doesn’t understand remote control even when there’s a simple remote/instructions we created with pictures). Due to family dynamics, she was placed on assisted living (long story short, some family members believe she’s just old even though we have had years of proof and doctor’s telling us she has Alzheimer’s) and is paying more daily since she requires the care of a memory care unit.

My recommendation is to hear what the facility recommends on where to place her. My mom and aunt are her primary caretakers but on paper my aunt is the one who makes the final call. She ignored the facilities recommendation and it’s backfiring immensely. My grandma refers to the memory care floor as death floor now since the people up there are very sickly and not as active. Is that all true idk since I’ve never been there.

My other recommendation is once the move is ready to happen, avoid having her around that process and make it as easy as you can for yourselves. Hire movers, have similar items in the unit that she’s accustomed to. IE if there’s a radio she can use, bring the exactly same model to her living facility. 

Sorry for the lengthily post but I’m happy to go into anymore details from my experience so feel free to DM.",2022-03-08 16:14:53,Intrikate,t9r3fk
Alzheimers,Grandmother Wandering - lost sense of location,"Hi,  my grandmother (with Alzheimer's) has lost her sense of location and she tends to wander around (sometimes even outside the house to unexpected places). I'm worried that she might end up on the road (which is potentially dangerous) and sometimes it takes a few hours to find her. Since she doesn't know how to use a phone, is there some sort of technology that would help me pinpoint her location? Ideally, I'd buy something that can be worn all the time (doesn't need to be removed or charged) as her whereabouts can be during unexpected hours.","Prevention is key here. We used toddler door handle covers that stopped my dad opening doors. We also installed cheap alarms on the doors so we would know if they were opened at night. Of course we would forget about them and open the door and scare the crap out of ourselves. Lol. Our genius idea was installing slide locks at the base of the door we could unlock with our toe. Dad never knew to look down there. Doing that stuff stopped he wandering around outside. 

Because he liked to walk around we would accompany him and let him walk wherever (within means).

A tracker will help if all else fails but they can easily take them off.
My sheriff's department had a tracker that you could put on wrist or ankle.  It didn't need charging, it just needed batteries change at specific intervals like monthly.  It didn't work for us because my DH is finicky and could take it off, he said it irritated his skin.  Fortunately, the local cops have always found him in a reasonable length of time.  They seemed to recognize that it was urgent to locate him.

Ask your local disability office if they have heard of something like that.

You might also consider a door alarm if she is getting out at night.  Do you live in the same house as her?  Another option is a motion-activated security cam that broadcasts alerts to your cell phone, if you are not physicalliy present, so you can initiate a search.
how about a Tile or Apple Airtag tracker sewn into her coat or on the inside of her shoes? Those don’t need frequent battery recharges (replace the whole battery like once a year only). They don’t use GPS, rather they use bluetooth to ping other cell phones nearby and basically piggyback on others’ internet connection (which is how the internet works in general actually). 

The Tile makes a noise when you beep it from the app on your phone. It’s more for like “now where did i put my keys down?”  situations.

The AirTag is meant for items that are generally kept nearby your Apple items, no sound is made. When you activate Lost Mode and the Airtag comes within range of anyone’s iPhone even strangers, your custom message pops up, asking that person to call the phone number that you give.",2022-03-08 18:24:18,MasterpieceStriking4,t9tuhl
Alzheimers,A twinkle of humor.,"I talked to my dad. He moved into the assisted living facility last week, and he seems to be adjusting well. 

I asked him if he was eating well. He said, “Yes, and you don’t even have to pay for the food here.”

I told him he was taken care of, and then I had a good chuckle.","My great aunt keeps wanting to pay the facility staff for bringing her tea, snacks or her meals. She is shocked every time they refuse, haha. I tried telling her that it’s like a country club where you pay at the beginning of the month, and everything is taken care of, but she just forgets it.
Good one!  Not necessary to enlighten him further.

I'm glad he's adjusting, as that can be hard for so many patients.  But maybe it's a really good fit for him.  Best case scenario, those places can be excellent for Alzheimer's people.",2022-03-08 20:23:42,CarelessWhiskerer,t9w6vc
Alzheimers,How to convince mom to eat? Any medications we can try to stimulate her appetite? She’s 104lbs and losing.,"I know that Alzheimer’s changes the way food tastes and can often make people forget to eat, but I’m at wit’s end with how to counter it.

For context: my mom is still relatively early stage (highly functional around her home, feeds and waters her cats like clockwork, keeps everything immaculate), but she’s extremely frail and losing rapidly. She’s 5’4” and has dropped from 120lbs in 2020 to 104lbs today — from 110 to 104 in just the last two months.

All her life, she’s been beautiful and slim, so eating very little is engrained in her identity and she’s convinced she’ll “get fat” if she eats more. She also complains that she “looks pregnant” and feels full when she eats even the smallest amount. To make matters worse, she hates the taste of EVERYTHING except biscuits, Kraft cheese, potato chips, potato salad, and sweet protein bars — all of which she eats very little of because she remembers that those foods are unhealthy.

Offer meat? She refuses, saying she hates the taste no matter how it’s cooked (even chicken fingers). Fish? She argues vehemently that she’s allergic (she used to love salmon but there’s no convincing her). Protein drinks? She finds them disgusting, saying they taste like “milk.” She no longer likes the taste of nuts. She doesn’t like beans or legumes. She’ll agree to eat vegetables and salads, but not enough to gain weight (and trust, they’re cooked in olive oil to get as much healthy fat as we can). As someone who tracks her own macros religiously (powerlifter), I’ve measured what mom eats and it fluctuates between a 400-800 calories/day.

On top of disliking nearly every food group, she frequently cites not feeling hungry. And yes, we’ve thoroughly investigated with the doctor to make sure there’s nothing else causing this (MRI, gastric emptying test, extensive bloodwork). He believes it’s because her abdomen is compressed due to the kyphosis (hunched over posture) caused by osteoporosis, driving her to feel full quickly and experience discomfort when eating more. And yes, we’ve tried getting her to eat small meals throughout the day, but that doesn’t make a difference. If anything, she eats less, thinking she’s had a bunch of meals already and thinking we’re “trying to make (her) fat.”

She’s already anemic due to B12 AND iron deficiency (we’re supplementing), but I’m so afraid that she’ll die of malnutrition long before the Alzheimer’s takes her.

Any advice is welcome. At this point, I’m ready to shove an appetite stimulant down her throat.","Hello, I got my mother to eat just by giving the food to her even when she said she wasn't hungry. She would eventually eat it. 

Also food vlogs on Youtube or cooking shows really help with her appetite, especially the food vlogs where they talk directly into the camera and are passionate about eating. My mum likes Mark Weins and a couple called Kyde and Eric. These videos really helped my mum who went from very boney and underweight to a very healthy weight, might work for you. Good luck!
We have very similar challenges with my mom.

Ensure has been a mixed blessing. She think's it's healthy (70s-80s era smoothie diet culture right there) and will drink it with every meal and in between meals. That gets her over 1000 calories alone. BUT - it's got a lot of sugar and, since it's most of what she consumes, it gives her diarrhea, which is another challenge.

So, we try to give her other soft sweet foods. We'll make scrambled eggs for her with a ton of butter and mix in some avocado. She'll pour Ensure on top to make them sweeter, and try to microwave the avocado, but at least it's some fat and protein. My dad doesn't cook much, but he's become an expert at heating canned soups for her and adding sweetener to them so that she'll eat them. Another poster on this forum or r/dementia suggested adding honey, so we'll puts some in her soup to make her eat more. She likes bananas and mushy pineapple. She also eats oatmeal (the super-sweet packet kind), so we mix that with as much whole milk as possible. We leave packaged bread and cookies out in hopes that she'll sneak one, and she occasionally does. And to combat the diarrhea, she gets Metamucil crackers (which she soaks in Ensure and then wants to heat up, making them a gross soggy mess, but she eats them).

It's not a healthy diet. But we've managed to keep her weight steady, and she still feels happy about what she's eating... and so we live with it.
My mother is the same! Her thinness, her brain and her looks are her identity. I've always felt she has disordered eating habits and it's so much worse now. 

Siblings all freak over her eating only junk now but my opinion is hey at least she is eating something. I'd rather she eat ice cream than not eat anything. 

Smaller portions seem to be easier for her, less overwhelming than a full plate. Snacks during the day too, if it's arranged on a plate she will be more likely to graze/nibble without feeling pressure. 

She gets upset at being pushed, food is pretty much the only thing she can control now so finding easier ways to get food in her is what matters. I try (when I visit) to be low key, just setting the plate next to her. If she isn't paying attention she tends to eat a bit more. 

It's so hard!
You could make certain that she has high calorie salad dressings. Grilled chicken, bacon bits, cheese can be used to increase the protein and calories of a green salad. 

Can you sneak rice mix with veggies into her diet? Buttery spreads and cheese can add to the mix to up the calories. 

What desserts does she like / love? Offer small portions. Pecan pie, cheesecake, walnut brownies, ice cream, yogurt..

Try fruit juice to get carbs and vitamins in her diet.
And for context, I’m what my mom considers fat: 5’5” and 148lbs of mostly muscle from lifting (photos scattered here on Reddit). Her bar is extremely disordered and has been all her life. In her mind, she looks good at this weight, despite the fact that her family are horrified. 

Sadly, the doctors haven’t helped, as when we bring up her weight to them, mom interjects with “but I think I look great!” at which point the polite Southern doctor agrees “Well I think you look great, too” Before trying to encourage her to eat more. What sticks in her mind is: “the doctor says I look great! Stop trying to make me fat!”
I’ve been concerned with weight loss over the past couple of years, too. I feel like my days revolve around tracking calories to make sure I can fit them all into a volume of food she can eat during very short waking hours. She loves sweets and doesn’t challenge anything I give her, so I’m lucky there. I use peanut butter, shakes (I got that mail order Huel brand because it was the most cals for a reasonable serving size for her and has “complete nutrition” although you’d have to drink a ridiculous amount to meet daily needs), high fat yogurt, etc. I just read about something called Duocal that adds calories (but no real nutrition) and supposedly doesn’t affect the taste or texture.

Will she eat oatmeal? If so, I’ve found varieties that are 230cals per serving and it’s easy to sneak in extras undetected. 1/4 c of ground walnuts disappear and add 200 cals. Siggis non dairy yogurt is 170cals, low sugar and high protein and Liberte is like 220 I think. Granola mixed with that can get you to almost 500 while seeming like a healthy choice to her. Another thing I give is 2 tbsp of pb, a banana and 2 tbsp honey for 400+ calories. Or I just put honey in her water.
Remeron also called Mirtazepam is an antidepressant which is also used as an appetite stimulant.  It requires a script.

Also, consider that the texture may not be appealing anymore.  As Alzheimer's progresses, often ground or even puree works best.

Otherwise, fortified shakes such as Ensure provide calories between meals.  Smaller more frequent meals and snacks are helpful.
Mirtazepine can help stimulate appetite
My mom would drink « coffee » it was actually cinnamon tea we added vanilla Glucerna as creamer and that got her some extra calories.
Try Ensure with ice cream, make a milk shake. In a small glass, and try straws. They seem to enjoy sucking on the straw. I’m finding Alzheimer’s patients love sweets and carbs.
So you didn't mention fruit once in your post, how does she feel about that?
It sounds crazy, but look up using red plates. Supposedly it leads to Alzheimer’s patients eating up to 25% more than regular white plates. My parents are still eating fine, so I don’t have any practical experience with this, but I read it in the Facebook Group.
Can you get her a prescription for medical marijuana?
I’ve had the same issue. My mom has always been a really picky about the food she will eat. I was living with her and I found things she liked to eat and could get her to eat, but she also worried about getting “fat”. She recently transitioned to living in memory care and she has lost about 40 lbs since October. I go grocery shopping and bring her favorite foods to her facility, but I almost feel like she had kind of forgotten how to actually eat, and has also lost the ability to identify and express hunger. The only thing I can think of has been to make sure she had those Ensure Max drinks, or high protein Ensure. Some of them have up to 30g protein. Her doctor also recommended the “complete cookie”, it apparently has a lot of nutrition if you can just get her to eat it. I’ve also been trying to make sure she has those high protein cereal or granola bars. Good luck I hope you are able to figure out a good solution. I’ve been so worried. My moms drastic weight loss keeps me up at night, she has been fainting a lot. I worry about her health/strength, but I also worry that she is suffering by not being provided enough assistance by the staff at her facility or that she is hungry and doesntv know how to express herself. The caretakers at the memory care seem to think it’s part of her decline, if course I feel like I know my mom better due to being her caretaker and her daughter. I get the feeling they think in being unrealistic and not accepting that she is nearing the end of her life. I do understand this, but I think 40+ pounds is a lot of weight to lose. I hope you are doing okay and taking care of yourself as well. So many ups and downs for all involved. I have never felt so sad/hopeless/angry/terrified. I only feel peace when im asleep. It must be so much worse for our loved ones. I wish the best for you and your mom.

Alzheimers,Self-Care For Caregivers event on Facebook,"Came up on my newsfeed - Passing this along ❤️

[https://www.facebook.com/events/1332091130642378](https://www.facebook.com/events/1332091130642378)",thanks for sharing,2022-03-07 16:07:45,hillsbeverly,t8zivk
Alzheimers,It’s going to end.,"I had a horrible revelation today that I’d not thought of before. 
(I’ve  lived with her 24/7 for 5 years. So no “I see them once a week and understand” nonsense replies).
I’m going to have to send her to a home when she becomes even worse. Or I’m going to have to try and wake her up one morning and find she’s dead. Either way I’ve failed.","Sounds to me like you’ve been successful for five years. We do the best we can to care for our loved ones and that - that’s everything. When the time comes that they need more help than we can give, we continue caring by giving them what they need. What we want doesn’t fit here. That’s the nature of love. We give everything we have for them. It’s a terrible disease. I’m sorry you all have been touched by it. You should consider talking to a hospice worker or social worker. It sounds like you have some personal things you need to work through. It’s better to do it now and gain some insight into what you should expect.
No offense, but I’m just trying to find how you could have ‘succeeded’ in this scenario? I’m in a similar boat (only 2 years now), but I have had to change a lot of my notions of success and failure here - just be gentle. All things end - and that is ok we don’t have the power to stop that (sorry I don’t mean to seem preachy, I’m genuinely curious).
I don’t see failure in any of those situations
Try your best to be patient and kind every day, try to redirect with humor when appropriate, and make sure she do not feel like a burden.  Tell her that you love her - even if she hasn’t a clue who you are - tell her you are grateful for the opportunity to be with her and spoil her in any little way you can - a cup of her favorite tea, soft sheets, a nice body lotion, a walk in the sun or time sitting in the window watching the birds flying around the bird feeder. Those are small victories over this dreadful disease.  The only success we will ever know is the peace of mind that we did our best.
Like other commenters, I’m in a similar situation and have had to adjust my thinking.  As long as you are able to give her good care, you give it.  When she needs more, you will find a place to meet that need.  That isn’t failure.  That is love. 

As for resuscitation, at our last round of appointments, various doctors gave us various forms to complete (along with doctor) that spelled out the end of life care protocol.  The paperwork and decision making is done ahead of time so when the time comes, you don’t have to decide in the moment. It sounds horrible, but that is an act of caring that you give to both of you. I haven’t done our paperwork yet, but we all know how this ends.  And it does eventually end-for all of us.  Find someone—medical professional, therapist, friend, family member to talk through these decisions and give yourself some grace.  

Best words I’ve heard from my mom’s doctor:  “you’re doing a good job”. Some days, that is what I have to hold onto.
Sorry OP, yeh it's sad, but, that's just the progression of life.

If you wake up one morning and find her dead,  best outcome has been achieved - let her 'stay home till the end'.  Like, of course I don't want my mum to die, but she's absolutely going to, can't stop that.

Neither do either of us wish for her to spend years in a facility not knowing nor remembering nor understanding anything, chair-bound or endlessly wandering hallways.  But, as I'm not 3 people able to take in shifts professionally trained geriatric care, then I'm damn GLAD that our country HAS geriatric dementia-safe & specialising facilities for our loved-ones to live in.

I lived in 3rd world countries for many years, and the poor poor geriatrics wandering around or day after year parked in a chair, as they don't have facilities available for middle-class or lower, and family simply can't afford for someone to stay 'home' taking care of them - forced to live on footpaths under plastic sheets, begging bowl out for a few pennies for food, or wandering the streets filthy in rags, or tied to a bed in a dark spare room hosed out sometimes - it's heartbreaking.

Sure, our western countries periodically have scandals of mis-care mis-management neglect at some facilities, but the most of them manage adequately, some fantastically.  Sometimes I'm sad thinking that she won't be lucky enough to peacefully pass away in her sleep, like a dream.  I hope I can get her into a good facility when that time comes, and that that transition happens smoothly, not after some traumatic incident.  Yeh, it's tough.  Fingers crossed for best luck for all of us!
I don’t think you failed at all. I’m right there with my father and it is not failure it is making someone feel safe and loved.
Everything is temporary. Everything.
No, you haven't failed. The sad reality is most sufferers of dementia need care more than family can give. There is zero shame in that, you are NOT a failure. If they do have to go to a home, you can still visit as much as you'd like
I'm there with you. I chose to send my mom to a care home. There isnt a single day when I don't feel guilty, but they offer a better care than me. I am so afraid to get too angry one day and hurt her. So, yeah. I understand.
I know how you feel. I became a live-in caregiver for my mom as her dementia progressed. It is so hard to understand unless you are living through it 24/7. And often times it was very hard to hear other family members complain about how are it was to deal with when they would come to help out for a couple of hours once a week. And inevitably they would come up with solutions and advice about the issues I would experience as a caretaker. I know they meant well, but half the time their ideas were very impractical. It’s was hard not to take it as judgement. They recently convinced me to transition her to memory care. Everyone in my family knew that it was getting to a point that I didn’t have the knowledge or ability to handle it alone. I just wanted her to feel safe and have whatever amount of happiness was possible for her. I still feel overwhelmed, guilty and sad. Just about slightly diff things. I oboe what you mean though, even when we have a good day, I know a bad day is soon to follow. It’s never going to get better, only worse. I feel like an failure cuz I couldn’t continue in my own. My mom has lost over 40 lbs since moving to MC, and has been in the hospital 6 times. I feel so guilty and I’m also afraid to visit sometimes. I don’t have any confidence in the facility and worry day and night. Today she yelled at me and told me she hated me and that her kids are dead. I just wanted to leave. I want her suffering to end, but that seems like a horrible thing to think. The only thing I can say is that lately I have been thankful for the moments we did have in the last couple of years. I know she depended on me and knew I was there for her and would do anything for her. And we did have a lot of moments that I will think back about and feel happy. We spent countless hours watching the golden girls and laughing. When I have a day like today and I feel defeated, hopeless, angry and terrified, I try to think of those times and one thing I do know is that if my momma is still in there anywhere, she knows that I spent her last couple of years with her in her home caring for her and loving her and trying to make her feel safe. But I know what you mean, there is no happy ending coming, I am often afraid of what each new day will bring. I wish you the best, dementia is cruel I hate it.
You haven't failed.  I'm sure you're doing the best you can.  You're not ""failing"" by sending her to a home.  You'd be giving her a little dignity while suffering from a disease that takes every last fiber of it.  We're not health care professionals - and dementia patients get to a point where they NEED professional care.  Be gentle with yourself.
No, it's not a failure. If there is any failure, it's the research world that really hasn't found any better medications or treatments in over two decades. It's in a disease that is so horribly cruel that it takes the person you know and descimates them.

Sending to a home isn't the worst thing. Trust me, I watched my mom change and then it took doctors several years ago admit that her memory loss wasn't linked to menopause brain fog or old age. 13 years battling this effing disease. Moving my mom in to memory care communities where staff were trained to manage the outbursts, depression, etc. was the best thing we did. 

While I helped out as much as I could while my dad was alive (unexpected stroke led to the discovery of a massive glioblastoma), it's clear he hid some of my mom's progression from us. When I took over, I stopped doing everything for myself and ended up battling anemia in major ways. A year of iron pill prescriptions, tests galore, surgical procedures, and blood draws has taught me one big thing. If I could go back and focus more on myself than on my parents, I would in a heartbeat.
Something people don't like to talk about at all is that caregiving - so rewarding! religious! spiritual! love! - is the absolute worst task ever because you will always ultimately fail because ultimately, everyone dies.  Which also makes it the most natural, normal task ever because ultimately, all of our existence is about survival and, again, ultimately, everyone dies.  So we all fail not just at caregiving but at keeping OURSELVES alive.  

It's just weird.",2022-03-07 13:07:35,Bolehillbilly,t8vcon
Alzheimers,dad taken away in handcuffs,"My (26m) dad is about 7 years into early onset Alzheimer’s. I recently put everything on hold and moved in with my mom and dad after finishing my undergrad degree to help out on a more permanent basis. We spend every moment of his waking life with him, just trying to keep him happy and safe and healthy. He needs help with nearly everything, even going to the bathroom. We are in the process for care home placement but my mom is careful because she had a very bad experience with care home mistreatment with her own mother.

My dad’s mood changes rapidly and sometimes he becomes violent. It is usually triggered by us reminding him to take off his boots or jacket, or anything else that threatens his autonomy. In this state he will punch the walls, throw things, and get in me and my mom’s face with a very crazed, unpredictable, frankly *feral* expression and body language. Today, about an hour ago, was the second time I had to get physical in order to protect my mom. I couldn’t be sure whether he wasn’t going to punch her in the face. I am terrified of head trauma because we think my dad’s condition is related to head trauma.

This time, he wouldn’t calm down. I kept my body between my mom and him. I would put my arms up to protect myself when he would raise his own fists. But he wouldn’t back down and he was breaking things. We called 911 (for the first time) expecting there to be an option for a mental health police dispatch, which (we found out too late) exists just outside our area, but not in our own municipality (Delta, BC, Canada). However, regular officers came. They tried to calm him down for a short time but when he continued to be violent they handcuffed him and took him away.

We are expecting a call back after he’s taken to the hospital. My mom is feeling very guilty and thinks he was mistreated by the officers and that he will be misunderstood at the hospital. I agree with the idea that the police did not deal with it in the most effective way, and that the hospital might also be a bad idea, but I’m not sure whether to feel guilty.

However, I want to believe we did the right thing given our options. I don’t think I can physically prevent myself from quickly intervening physically with anyone who raises a hand against my mom. In fact I think I would regret it for the rest of my life if my mom got seriously hurt when I could have prevented it.

thanks for reading. any comments welcome","I think you did the right thing. It may not have went how you wanted it to, but it’s far from the worst outcome. I’m proud of you for protecting your mom too.
My FIL was placed in a memory care place in part for the same reason, to protect my MIL.  It is very hard but this disease often presents only unpalatable options. (I'm not saying ""bad"" options because the outcome of our choices can be good). Good luck to you & your family.
Talk to his Doc about meds. Seoquele has calmed down my wife immensely but there are others. I have to sneak hers in in a piece of candy.
This happened to my mom. You did the right thing. In the case of my mom she was put on a 72 hour hold then sent to a psych ward which would only release her to a memory care. It got to the point for my family where she literally tried stabbing me and my father with a knife. When a dementia patient gets violent their frontal lobe isn't intact enough to tell them to stop and sometimes you need force and reinforcements to stop them before they do something their healthy self would never allow. What you and your mom did was save your father from doing something his healthy self would never do. You saved yourself. You saved her. And you got him the help he needs to make sure he doesn't do something he would forever regret.

If you want any additional support feel free to pm me
If your dad were in his right mind, he would hate that he put you in this situation. He would want to be restrained.  With this violent stage of the disease (doesn’t happen for everyone and doesn’t last forever), there are only 2 options. Physical restraints, or chemical restraints. Which do you think he’d prefer, in the long run?  I advocate for medication. Work with your doctor. 

If it makes you feel better, if he were in a care home, they also would have called 911. I know because I work in a hospital. That’s where the nursing homes send their patients that become violent, throwing chairs through windows, etc.. There is often no other options. All the hospital can do is chemical and physical restraints. They return to the home once the home feels secure with whatever changes the doctors made to their medications to keep the staff safe. 

No nothing about this disease is ideal.
you did the right thing. what else could you have done?

i've been in a very similar situation. i had to call the cops for the first time ever in my life on the morning of new years eve. he was back home by the end of the day though. and now we're back to just hoping he doesn't go that far again. could happen at any moment. he's been an asshole my whole life, but this disease is amplifying his worst qualities

i know this might sound fucked up, but a part of me was disappointed that he didn't get loud with the cops. i live in america. cops love killing people here. if they took him down, it would've solved a lot of problems for us.

i can't offer any useful advice. sorry. but at least you're not alone.
You protected your mother and you protected your father. You did the right thing. 

My guess is that your father would not want anyone treating your mother this way and would have wanted you to protect her. 

You also protected your father, his anger could have continued to grow and her might have done something that would have hurt your Mom, which he would not like, or he might have done something to the wrong person and had an even worse outcome.

Make sure both you and your Mom are able to talk about this situation with someone. Whether it is a support group, close non-judgemental family member, or a professional counselor, make sure both of you are talking to someone. This is a traumatic event and it will help to process it with someone that understand the situation and can offer emotional support.
This is a long shot, but...

my spouse sometimes gets real angry and takes off out the front door... although hopefully this is over since he is not spatially oriented any more.  I know it is about loss of autonomy or else feeling inadequately respected.

We've discussed it with a therapist, who helped him to be more accepting of the loss of some abilities but suggested there are other ways he can be useful still.  I think the therapist called this approach ""radical acceptance.""  And I have learned to deal with his outbursts better too.  If he starts to get mad, I plead with him not to get mad, that my latest rule was necessary because (reason).  

I guess what I am trying to say is of course it's depressing and anger-producing to have such profound losses as an Alzheimer's patient has, and by showing some compassion around those feelings (that they have trouble expressing), we can perhaps alter outcomes.

Just a thought, anyway.
I was in a very similar spot with my grandfather.  His violent outbursts could be triggered by anything, but often centered around changing or bathing him.  As their frequency increased and it was becoming too hard for us to handle we spoke to his doctor and he recommended Seroquel -- and it changed everything.  It took about a week for it to really level out his mood, but the difference was incredible.  He might still have the occasional outburst but it was much easier to manage and redirect.  My biggest piece of advice is to find a compounding pharmacy that can make it for you in a sweet tasting liquid (we used vanilla).  He could be difficult with pills, but would always eat a dessert or milkshake.  I found milkshakes or smoothies to be easiest because I would just put the dose in the straw to be sure he got all of it.  

Seroquel made the difference between being able to care for him at home instead of putting him in a care facility.  We were adamant that a facility would be the last resort as we had bad experiences with care facilities.
Easily you did the right thing. At the hospital, you may even find out that some anti-psychotic medication can help his aggression issues (helps my FIL). I assume this is sun-downers, too?
You did the right thing.  It’s the primary reason that I moved my Dad to memory care because I knew I could not stop him if he decided to do something dangerous or even just stupid.  I think it hurts your relationship on both sides when you are forced to become the jailer and punisher.  With my Dad Memory Care, I am free to just be his daughter and he my Dad.  It changed the dynamics almost instantly.  The social interaction there also helps him quite a bit.  He thinks it’s an apartment complex for senior citizens and is happier than he’s been in years and safe.",2022-03-05 15:37:05,errbek,t7i9up
Alzheimers,Remote controlling TV for Dad in assisted living,"We just moved my Dad to assisted living this week , on Monday, and today is the first day i haven't cried about it so far.   All of the hardships and emotions aside, I'm trying to find ways to make his life there easier.   I did order one of those TV remotes that has 4 buttons on it to make it simpler, but I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for having full access of the TV remotely.

&#x200B;

I read someone set up a raspberry pi and IR emitter or some other crazy setup, but I'm not really at the point of pursuing that if there's any other option.  I'd like to be able to turn the TV on and off and access all TV menus (changing input) as well as opening youtube and bringing up videos for him remotely.  Is there ANYthing even close to something like that in existence?  He does not follow instructions very well so 'push the volume button' would be a struggle.    Complicating things is the multiple remotes, so if i DO hook up a amazon fire stick, he's not going to know how to use the remote.  

&#x200B;

Just curious what strategies others might have had for helping a loved one remotely with a TV.   He's definitely getting some more activities this week than he was at home, so it's not like i'm encouraging him to just sit in front of the TV for 12 hours,  but if he wants to watch the news or a sporting event or some educational videos, I'd like to be able to make that happen for him","Honestly, from all I've heard and experienced, operating the TV remote is the first thing to go - maybe after computer skills.  I've tried to simplify remotes, write my own very simple remote on the computer and even bought a Roku TV because it has the simplest interface.  No dice. The issue is that the idea of multiple inputs is just too much, so ditch Netflix et al and stick to DirecTV or live channels (even switching channels is a major challenge now). What seems simple to me (apps vs cable vs live TV) is completely incomprehensible to my wife.  Think smaller.  Think simpler.  If possible, find a favorite channel that never needs to be changed.  I think this issue is at the heart of a lot of people's lives at a certain stage of this disease. Good luck and let us know what you come up with.
My mother lives in an AL facility about 15 minutes from me.  

She has gotten to the point where she can't use the TV remote, so we are considering an Alexa enabled (voice controlled) TV, which i think would allow us to control the TV remotely (like from our house).

We already have and Echo Show, which we have programmed to announce the date and remind her to take her pills.  It also allows us to 'drop in' and talk to her if she can't answer the phone.  It also allows us to use as a camera and see her, and we have it scrolling through family photos for her to look at.

She was good at asking alexa the time and playing music but has started to forget the commands so we have written them down and taped to the device.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps.  If we get an Alexa TV i'll tell you how it goes.
We've tried a Broadlink Universal Remote Mini 3 previously which links with Alexa, it worked well and was easy to setup, I think there are newer versions now but haven't tried them. I could remotely turn on the TV, change channels and even get a playstation turned on along with setting up schedules to turn it on in the morning and off at night. 

I've also tried the switchbot but it was hopeless. 

The harmony hub is meant to be good but it's more expensive and I haven't been able to try it yet.
My dad also went to AL this week, and he gets DirectTV. The setup was so complicated that I could barely operate it. 

It’s so frustrating. These systems are not design for seniors and people with declining mental ability.
My dad is in memory care and we have been told the staff will put his movies on for him since he can't use the TV on his own. Not sure what his level of care is, but maybe the staff could provide some assistance?
I got my gran one of those Alexa TVs with voice control thinking it would be easier, and to be honest it’s more trouble than it’s worth. Don’t do it.",2022-03-04 13:57:06,RoadblockBodyMassage,t6q55q
Alzheimers,It's happening after all.,"We are moving MIL into a facility local to us after all. We toured a few places back in December, but after visiting with her and the rest of my spouses family (small family- his mom, his uncle, and his grandmother) we decided to move both MIL and GMIL into an assisted living facility in their state. MIL and GMIL live together, and it is not safe for them...at all.  I'm not entirely sure what happened, but we get a call this week saying that GMIL understands our reasonings for moving MIL to our area and that it needs to happen quickly. GMIL is getting scared of MIL's behaviors and their memory doctor said she needs 24 hour care immediately.  


We made the call yesterday afternoon to our first choice facility that is specifically for Alzheimer's patients. Looks like this is happening soon. Very soon. Like within a week or so.   


It's going to be hard. I know once we bring her down here and out of her familiar space things are likely to deteriorate quickly. I remember going through that with my grandfather. But I am so devastated knowing that deep down, GMIL knows this will very likely be the last time she sees her daughter. GMIL is in her 90's and can't travel easily. We are definitely going to have to get uncle up to date on technology so we can video chat.","If uncle has Facebook Messenger app, then you guys can use that to video chat. That way not everyone has to have the same type of device to be compatible.  It’s what we use. And we use it often because our family is large and lots of people to keep in the loop.
My MIL needed to be moved ASAP when she regressed to the day before her husband died. She believed he was at the hospital and it was just impossible. We had to be with her continuously and everything in her home triggered memories of him. When the ambulance came to take her to hospital as a stepping stone to memory care she thought she was going to visit her husband in hospital. She actually ran to the ambulance at 95 years old. She is much more content now and still doing OK in memory care over 2 years on. The only problem other than frequent COVID lockdowns has been other residents bumping into her with their walkers. Her skin is like paper, poor thing.",2022-03-04 11:36:20,acciowine5,t6myzg
Alzheimers,Waiting,"My wife and I have been married for over 45 years.  The last couple of years I have seen a decline in her memory/cognitive abilities.  Our family primary care physician noticed this too.  A year or so back he tried to refer her for testing but she was in denial and would not go.
But lately, in the last few weeks, there has been a significant change.  She has begun speaking to me about myself in the third person.  She is confused about who I am.  She told me that she wished that I had known her father (I was with him the night he died).  When I pointed this out to her she became afraid and we had a good conversation.  We agreed to go for testing, which we did a few days ago.  Spent 5 hours with a neuropsychologist, who gave a tentative diagnosis of mild dementia.  But she also wants to order a brain scan before she adds Alzheimer’s or some vascular issue in the brain to her diagnosis.  So we are waiting on the scan.  She is afraid.  I am wondering if this rather sudden change in her memory and cognition may be indicative of a rapidly developing case of dementia/Alzheimer’s.  Hopefully we will learn more after the scan. Any info or wisdom appreciated!","There is no way to diagnose Alzheimer's before death (in a post-mortem) as you probably know.  They may conclude that the likeliest diagnosis is Alz, having ruled out other things.

While you are waiting, remember to be demonstrative of your love for her.  Even when the mind is going, physical gestures like smiles and hugs are very important.
Well,  surely doc would have checked that she doesn't have a UTI (urinary tract infection), which is known to instigate sudden significant confusion & dementia-like symptoms?   So sorry MarshRide, it's hard, and sad.   Check out your area dementia .org & alzheimers .org, they have tons of resources & info & support .. best of luck!
Update.  Report came back from the neuropsychologist.  My wife has a major cognitive disorder.  But no specific diagnosis yet.  Brain MRI set for next week.  Last few weeks she has been confused about who I am.  Thinks that I just came into her life (we’ve been married 47 years).  The disease (whatever it is) seems to be worsening rather quickly.  I am hoping the MRI will provide more clarity to her situation and any prognosis and possible medications that may help.",2022-03-03 23:17:40,MarshRide,t6acxb
Alzheimers,I am recording an interview with my father who is an alzheimers sufferer to help with retention and to keep a record of his personality before he deteriorates.

Good idea, I wish I did this.
We've asked a lot of questions. I liked hearing about what they considered huge lifetime events (I was expecting to hear about WW2 rationing etc but nope, they were teens intent on dating and passing in school lol), or what they saw as a very right move they made. Life as children with their parents. Just..as much as I wanted to know because in the end it's my way of holding on to them before they dissappear altogether in that awful thing called dementia.
Favorite songs, hobbies,  memorable events.
Keep in mind eventually they don’t even recognize themselves so don’t get too excited about retention. We did lots of mini videos and photo albums and my mom just says what a nice family. Good luck!
What makes you laugh? What were your biggest dreams that did or did not happen? 

Man this makes me want to have one more conversation with her. And just to hold her tight and tell her how much she did for me and made me smile. 

You're a good egg OP.
Wish I'd done the same.  Ask family history, childhood stories, Any memories help.  Feelings about any circumstance u think important.   My dad had many instances when he could've died, even in childhood.  Somehow, not only did he survive, he thrived!  Met my mom, had myself & my brother.

Alzheimers,I need advice about meeting with my Mom's neurologist today.,"Hello :)  
My mother has been showing cognitive decline for about 5 years now.   They mostly manifest as short-term memory problems, loss of concentration.    However lately, she has been showing signs of deeper agitation.   She calls her sons up and says she want to divorce her husband, that he's not a warm man, etc.   This is her sweetheart of 40 years.   Her caregiver in many ways.   She also has moved out of their shared bedroom.   


The pandemic (and my divorce) has caused her circle to shrink.   She has been with her husband in their small bubble.   He is going deaf and is vain about getting a hearing aid.   I've been imploring him to get one.   My mom is so intuitive and sensitive.   When she calls him cold and too focused (only in the last few weeks), i have to connect that with his lack of hearing / awareness.    


Anyway, I set up and appointment with her neurologist today.   The purpose is to get her into see a neuropsychiatrist and this is the first step.   Perhaps there is some medication that she can take to help her depression (i know the dangers of treating dementia patients for depression).  


The problem is, that we've been mostly shielding her from our thoughts about her 'delusions'.  She does know she has a bit of memory problems...but that's it.   She always resists the medications (namenda) and visits to any doctor that is connected to cognitive decline.   It's as if her pride and indignation are coming to the surface with this condition.  She thinks she's a 20 year old superstar. 

Do you guys think it makes any sense to bring up my concerns with her in the room?   Or does it makes sense just to observe her visits, and have a follow up call with the doctor.   I just know that if it was me who was the patient, I would want to have agency and awareness about it.   

Thanks!","If she has been prescribed Namenda I’m assuming she has already been diagnosed with dementia. Telling the nurse assistant or the neurologist that the behavior has been getting progressively worse since her last visit is really all the information they will need to know. They may ask for details but this will be just to try to confirm what type of dementia they suspect your mother has. Then they can focus on addressing the behavior problems associated with her particular type of dementia. 

I understand not wanting to talk about symptoms with the patient around. When I was trying to get my wife diagnosed I could describe dementia like symptoms but once I use the D word I was chewed out for hours afterwards.

I started handing the nurse a piece of paper with bullet points describing her symptoms at the time of the last visit, then how they have become worse and any new problems. This made our office visit smoother, less stressful and I believe much more productive. Questions written down are not forgotten and tend to get a much more thorough answer.
Having been in your situation with my mother I think that a phone call to the neurologist ahead of her appointment to express concerns would be appropriate as long as you have medical power of attorney/or your mother has previously authorized her health care providers to speak to you.
I don't know about talking to the doc when she's in the room, or out. However, I have found that doctors, like many busy professionals, can read & retain info faster than they can listen. Plus, they're on a tight leash from their practice or health insurance, in terms of how much time they can spend on any patient. And they may cognitively skew toward science, facts, theoretical models more than to interpersonal skills eliciting information.

Some docs delegate the soft people skills work to other staff, like a nurse. It's perhaps an efficient division of labor, but risks the soft-skill staffer disregarding a small detail as irrelevant when conveying info from you to the doc.

You're articulate; can you write up what you've observed, in concise, objective prose, heavy on quantifiable info, leaving out hunch and conjecture unless it seems glaringly obvious to you?

You may have to snail-mail or hand carry, as portals don't usually accept long write-ups, and HIPAA means you cam't send regular (unsecure) email. 

Another benefit of written communication is that it remains accessible; it does not disappear once conveyed (as it does when given orally). So a doc (or nurse) may review notes at a followup visit, and be able to catch material that didn't seem important at the time, but in light of developments does become relevant.
It might be too late, but contacting the doctor before you go to the visit has worked well for me. Every doctor but one (now a former doctor) has been thankful for the heads-up.  It gives the neurologist insight and the ability to focus on what's been going on. Even the eye doctor was grateful - they were able to make mom's visit comfortable for her. They knew (because I told them) that she wouldn't understand most of what they were talking about and that her vocabulary was really limited, so they planned ahead to talk to her but watch me for cues and assistance. This allowed my mother to have some ""agency"" and maintain her feeling of independence.
On the thing with your dad, he might also be talking louder to her than normal due to hearing loss. My dad tends to perceive a louder voice as yelling. My boyfriend is partially deaf and my dad would think he was being cold when he just didn't hear him.

Ask your dad if his vanity is more important than his wife's wellbeing. That should make him indignant but move in the right direction.
Can you spend 48 hours at their place? Spending that time with them will give you a different perspective of the two and how her husband is really handling things with your mom. I just did that and now understand why my friend thinks her husband of 45 years wants to kill her. He doesn’t of course, but he’s not as compassionate as she needs. I get that it’s hard on him, but she’s truly suffering- lots of fear and anxiety. Stay a night or two.",2022-03-03 09:13:22,zagoren,t5sgys
Alzheimers,Could a jolt to the brain help people with Alzheimer's?,,,2022-03-02 14:51:34,Starrchaser21,t58jqg
Alzheimers,New to caring and needing advice,"I have been taking the night shift with my non-mobile grandmother (93) 2 nights a week for the past month. I am in need of some advice on a few things. 

1. My grandmother remembers me and all her family but does not remember that we are at her house, where the bathroom is, basically any short term memory (if she has eaten today, that she has asked the same question every 5 min for the night).... Is this a stage? Like what to expect in the next stage or will everything just go away all at once?

2. I have a toddler and must admit that my visits prior to helping out were short. I feel that my grandmother is getting worse during the time that I am here and she says things that make me know she feels lost without my aunt.... Do az patients get worse when something changes? I don't know that this really matters because my aunt was basically the sole caretaker and she has a lot of other things to handle so I can't stop. Just wondering if I'm pushing things faster than it should go. 

3. When something terrible happens or she gets sad about something it returns like a broken record. For example, my uncle fell down the stairs one night (typically nothing is retained longer than a few minutes) but that night she awoke every 30 minutes in a panic because she was worried about him (he's fine.). Is there a way to help some other things stick? Like I considered putting a sign up that says bed time 8 pm with a clock near it so she would stop fighting me to go to bed at 6. (In all actuality, I don't think staying up later makes her get up less throughout the night but that was what I was told.) 

4. My grandmother gets mad at my aunts (1 main care taker and 1 helps periodically) and will get aggressive and mean to them. With me she doesn't do that at all, but with her and my uncle needing help and feeling like I'm struggling with my toddler and work and life, I have snapped at her 2x. I never have gotten like actually mean but for instance when she keeps on saying she was going to turn off something I told her to go ahead, knowing she can't stand on her own. And when it dawned on her that she couldn't I felt terrible and cried a lot that day when I logged onto work. How do you keep from snapping when you are tired? You can't walk away, you can't explain like you can with a 2 yo because its gone a minute or two later. What do you do?","God bless you and keep you for your kindness. I'm just starting the dementia journey with my partner, snd took care of dad through hospice with some short-term, situational dementia.

Many here recommemd the book *The 36-Hour Day* as a solid, one-stop resource for questions—how-to, best practices, descriptions of stages, and so on. 

Yes, change is scary to loved ones with dementia. Something as simple as changes in the angle of sunlight can be upsetting, a phenomenon called ""sundowning."" I suspect it's connected to the sense of loss of control, disorientation we all feel when something is ""off"" but we can't quite put our fingers on it.

It won't get better, although there may be different ways your loved one acts out, and even a few flashes of more lucid thinking.

Redirection is one strategy for the panic response. ""Aunt couldn't stay with you tonight, so I'm here instead. I'm ThatsHighlyUnlikely, your grand-daughter. Would you like a cookie?"" Rather than challenging your loved one's (mis)perceptions, go with the flow. ""Yes, the bathroom does seem to have moved across the house; let's find it together.""

Ask her to tell you stories of when she was younger. See if music, especially from her youth, offers ease. Perhaps meditation or Reiki music—floaty, unstructured ambient sound, crickets, rain—lots available free on YouTube, various apps and online widgets. 

It's okay for you to snap, as you say without actually being mean; you'd be crazy if you didn't. Recover as best you can, and let it go. You're doing the best you can. 

Whether signage and clocks will help depend largely on whether she can read, and process written language, clock faces; it's worth a try.

Alzheimers,Caretakers of and people with Alzheimer's: what resources do you wish existed?,I'm a student of a biomedical illustration/communications program and am creating a patient/caretaker education piece for my Masters project. My grandma has Alzheimer's and my family has found it very difficult to find succinct resources for patient care. I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and what resources you'd find helpful.,"A clear list of what to do when. For example: parent getting older- sort POAs, living wills, financials, etc. Parent showing signs of MCI: plan for care as disease progresses, find proper medical team, etc. 
And extend that list all the way through when to call hospice.
Entertainment.  

In Europe, there is a country that has an entire town that is dedicated for dementia patients alone.  So the people are able to live their life in comfort and with freedom yet safety.  They aren’t locked away but can roam the streets (within reason) doing their shopping or whatever really without being in hospital environment.  In my mind, a way to take care of them which does not involve them ever having to realize that they actually have dementia.  A way for them to live in blissful ignorance until they can’t.
a free legal advisor to help set up all financials, plan for long term care, get will and medical papers in order...someone who can just do all of that stuff in one neat little package, preferably via a volunteer organization since caretakers have little to no emotional and financial resources to spend doing those VERY important things
We contacted our local Agency on Aging for help and were told to contact the Alzheimer's Association, so we did that and they told us to contact Agency on Aging. That was so frustrating. Our dad had died unexpectedly and he'd hidden how bad our mom was getting. After working with a social worker at her neurologist's office and the doctor's, we still didn't feel confident.

Oddly, the most helpful resource we found was the director of an Alzheimer's community in a neighboring state. 

Her tips were to get POAs, advance directives, and wills taken care of ASAP. Thankfully, that was done already. Then, she said get on a list of Medicaid communities LONG before you even may need it as most require your parent to live there at least two years before they'd consider taking your parent in for end-of-life care through Medicaid. Sure enough, when our mom started wandering and was running out of savings, dozens of places told us we'd waited too long.
More money and research on finding a cure or effective prevention/treatment. 

The strain this disease puts on caregivers emotionally, financially, and even physically is a lot. Patients have a better chance these days to manage HIV, but AD was discovered in 1906. Its shameful this disease doesn’t appear to be given as much attention other than “just deal with it.”
Online support meetings like AA
I've been thinking about this. I had breast cancer last year. Everything I needed, from surgery, ultrasounds, MRI, physical therapy, radiation, medical oncology... all took place at the same breast center. The providers were familiar with each other and communicated as an entire team. Does nothing like this exist for dementia patients? I have never heard of it if there is. We have had to navigate many different doctors, neurologists, specialists, lawyers, facilities etc..it would be so helpful to have a comprehensive dementia center that helps with specialists and doctors, appointments, resources, and information.
The right to end your own life when you want to. Alzheimer's is a barbaric way to let people you love expire. I've lost my mom and my sister to this fucking disease and we need to find a way to allow people to choose when they can leave. Fuck religion. If this comes for me, I'm leaving the US and going someplace where I can step out before it stops my brain from working. It's simply become another money making scheme to prey on our idiotic fears. Fuck Alzheimer's.",2022-03-02 00:33:56,rad__nad,t4sujr
Alzheimers,It’s getting harder…,"I’ve gone for years like the dog in the meme in restaurant that is on fire and he’s saying “This is fine.” 
It’s not. My mom is starting to go down hill. It’s become so painfully apparent. Her identity and memories are like sand in an hour glass and I feel like I’m doing whatever I can to slow the inevitable. Grasping and grains! 

She’s misplacing things regularly. Having a harder time finding words. Getting more confused. She gets disoriented in the evening about her room being a different room. Her hygiene is declining and I have to remind her to bathe and brush her teeth. She does weird stuff like put her coffee in a Tupperware container or a Netipot  and drink from it. She once put Neosporin in her eye instead of eye drops. She rummages through our trash and pulls things out and hides it in her room. The list goes on. 

Lately she has been stressed and sad and I see the pain in her eyes. I found a new neurologist that we really like who is active in the disease with books and studies. Compassionate too. He recently put her on a Rivastigmine patches at the lowest dose and I’ve noticed she has become more depressed and restless. She has been having episodes almost daily. Saying she is miserable and she wants to go home. To park her things and leave. She has lived with me for years.  It’s so disheartening and stressful. 
I wanted this medication to work for her and slow down the disease. It’s not been easy. 

I’m at a loss here. I want to help her. 

I’m hoping that we can up her lexapro by another 5mg. She’s on the lowest dose at 5mg. She’s always had depression, anxiety, and mood swings. Always made threats. She has history of instability, and for once she found that with me because when she moved in with me I told her she needed to take her medication for her depressions. 
Over time we found a balance with only an episode once or twice a month where she is upset and locking herself in her room for a few hours. Now that the rivastigmine is in her system for the last two weeks it has been almost daily. I don’t want to give up on it yet. 

Any advice or insight is appreciated. Thank you for reading this far.

ADDING: 

She recently became more disturbed with the introduction of Rivastigmine. Trying to find balance but I know this battle is not an easy one.","Since my dad was not on the same medication, I'm very little help on the matter.  From what I understand, medication can slow down, but not always.  It can also give other side effects (my dad lost consciousness a few time, to the point he needed the stop the medication).  However, I would consider finding a nursing home where she would get the care she needs 24/7. Also if you have not done that already find something to cheer you up and rest.  Realizing that a love one is to a point it's too much for one person to handle is rough.  Sending virtual hugs.
I think that as dementia progresses, the average home has way too many distractions for a dementia patient to interact with.  My husband was briefly in a nursing home following surgery.  The environment is so much more spare with things for the patients to go astray with.  For example, the coffee comes to them in a cup - they don't have to make it themselves.  There are not bookshelves with hundreds of titles, like we have at home.  My husband  complicates home life by picking up an object in one room and setting it down in another, willy nilly.  Right now we are missing the cord to his CPAP machine and I will have to order another.

While I believe in rich environments, home life has too many options.  Even selecting a TV channel using a remote is too demanding intellectually.

My goal is to find suitable residential accommodations for him but meanwhile, I try to limit the home environment.  It's an ongoing struggle.

I have no experience with rivastigmine.  My husband was taking donepezil and memantine.  We had to discontinue the donepezil due to a bradycardia side effect.

Good luck to you.  It's endlessly challenging.

Alzheimers,Moving day.,"Today dad moves into assisted living. I can’t help but wonder how long he’ll be there. He’s entering stage seven, and he’s seen such a rapid decline over the last two years, I kind of hope he doesn’t have to stay long. 

My childhood home will have to be sold. My dad will never live in his house he and mom paid off years ago. All he worked for has been reduced to a studio apartment, a small amount of possessions, and a failing mind. 

Such a sad day.","\---All he worked for has been reduced to a studio apartment, a small amount of possessions, and a failing mind.

that statement is gut wrenching. Mostly because it's true when it comes to this disease. My grandmother is rapidly declining and we can't get her into assist living, so I can't imagine the tool it will take on my family.

Good luck to you and yours.
In assisted living, place loads of photo memories on the outside of his door. Helps him recognise the room and in a way attracts them toward it. My dads mums room also had a clear box next to the entrance you could put possessions in so they could recognise the door. Made her more comfortable going into the room because it was “her place”.
Same situation here with my dad. ❤️ It sucks. The journey is long and seemingly takes everything. 

Hold on to the love you shared and the good memories you still carry. 

Sending you strength.
for what it's worth, we moved my dad out of his 'forever' home 5 days ago and he seems to be adapting very well. All of the clutter that used to confuse him is gone and he's surrounded by people who are paid to be care for him. I was shocked at how quickly he found comfort. Rest assured that he doesn't see this move as a sound-minded person would...After a relatively short period, he'll be much better off. and so you will you.

Alzheimers,How to handle violent outbursts?,"My nan has Lewy Body dementia. She is prone to violent outbursts which include hitting, kicking, pushing, throwing things, etc. a couple of days ago she attempted to pick up a chair and throw it. No amount of reasoning, talking, or yelling gets through to her in these episodes. How do we intervene in these situations? If we can remove the object she’s using as a weapon we do but sometimes she’s after you herself hitting and kicking. How are we supposed to handle this? Does anyone have any advice? 

Also, we are actively trying to get her in a home but none of the homes in our area will even return our call. We have tried showing up in person and still no is is available to help. It’s a frustrating situation, I just think they don’t want another Alzheimer’s patient in their care.","I'm really sorry, OP. We dealt with this with my dad before he passed. We couldn't find anywhere that was willing to take a man with ""behaviors"". Best I can suggest is to reach out to your nan's doctor to talk about medication changes.
Has she been checked for a uti? Sorry if that seems obvious to you but my mom was going through something similar a few weeks ago and it was all due to uti.
Distract. Start signing, dancing, goofing around. Moon her! Crank on some 50s music. Break out some candy or a drink.
If it's Lewy Body Dementia, they frequently hallucinate and the behavior can get pretty extreme.

After being turned down for some memory care homes based on my Father's diagnosis, we finally found one that would take him. He ended up being on some pretty strong medications and he finally settled down somewhat. I don't have advice for the outbursts, since medications were all that could keep him somewhat calm.
Sorry to hear what your going through. Sometimes figuring out the root of her aggression can be the key. In my case my mum has violent outbursts when she gets frightened and can't remember our faces and thinks we're strangers or she doesn't even know where she is even though she's at home. Sometimes it's the tv being on and she doesn't like the program, sometimes her own reflection in the mirror has frightened her and once she was in pain with her foot and she forgot why she was angry and took it out on us anyway. 

Also a good tip is if you leave the room, put on a different outfit and then go back to her it can change her mood. Last thing I bought a life-sized cardboard cutout of a celebrity she fancies and when she got angry she shouted at him instead of me. Just a few thoughts, maybe one of them will help you.

Alzheimers,Can someone explain what Sun-downners is like?,"I hate Alzheimer's . This diesease is heartbreaking. Currently we have my father in a licensed assisted living facility ... but his condition is worsening faster then anyone thought. Some of my family want to begin talks about him going into memory care... as he showed his first sign of Sundowners... obsessing over a document and refusing to eat and staying up for 24 hours because a ""document told him to do so."" What can be done? What is sundowners?","Yes. It's a terrible disease. Sundowning is just a cluster of symptoms that tend to start to occur late in the day, as described [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/expert-answers/sundowning/faq-20058511). It does sound like he might need the more specialized care of memory care rather than assisted living at this point.
Sundowners is more confusion than usual because their brain tires more easily. Solution is sleep.
Absolutely. My mother had it really bad her last year alive. When daylight savings ended in the fall and it got dark early she started going nuts. Seeing her reflection terrified her so we have to close all the shades and take all the pictures/paintings that were framed down. It was horrible to see how terrified she would get. SO SORRY you're going through this.
[There's a lot of info on what sundowning is via a google search.](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=alzheimer%27s+sundowning&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)  


Let me in on what I've learned after having gone through this and my experiences and observations.  
The assisted living model is NOT good for people that are going through dementia early Alzheimers.  I've seen multiple people go through a rapid decline in their abilities in these homes and when you think about it the business model is usually aligned with a memory care facility (owned by the same corporation perhaps) and so the money that is charged in a memory care is much greater and with little more cost in terms of care overhead (more profits) and so... I've seen people rapidly degrade.  


The best thing is to have the family member be and stay with family if you want to have them live longer and better in what remains in their disease.  The family structure does help them greatly with slowing their decline and all the studies show that it's the best thing.  


Now we all understand that people have to work to keep a roof over their heads but if you can.. keep them with you.   My father is in the advanced stages now and is still with me.   our experiences with a memory care were negative in that my father suffered a rapid decline across the board that I had to work to correct when I was able to take him out and get him into my home.   At times it's not been easy and I've made sacrifices but during covid, it was actually beneficial to us both.  My father always tried his hardest to be helpful and was very grateful for not being what he described as ""in prison"" any longer... you just have to remember no matter what, they're sick and have something they honestly are afraid of having .. it's a nightmare for them.

Having said that,   
There are drugs and treatment that go a long way towards controlling and mitigating the symptoms of sundowning and whatever else you're experiencing with them.  Nutrition plays a big deal in helping them and there's many supplements that I've used that have worked well to towards helping my fathers condition.   Being outside and exercise are also important, it all makes a difference.  
Some fixes are easy, like when he became agitated due to sundowning frustrations I could always give him a little CBD candy and that calmed him down in less than 30 minutes.   


Distraction and deflection are valuable skill sets and the worst thing is to try to ignore such symptoms (imo) it just reinforces them.    Sometimes it's unavoidable but... harmless.  


for example my father would wake up in the middle of the night and then become fascinated by the [boxes of disposable gloves I'd keep in his room.](https://www.costco.com/clear-touch-food-prep-poly-gloves%2C-one-size%2C-2%2C000-count.product.100410420.html)  I'd wake up the next morning with thousands of these clear plastic gloves all over the floor and in his bed.  He's become fascinated with peeling them off and filled the space between the sheets with them.  
They would be stuck all over his naked body as he clutched the remains of multiple destroyed boxes.  It's cool, I peeled everything off and put all of them in a gallon sized ziplock for later use. *(note to self: no more shiny disposable gloves overnight on the dresser)*   


Just know that this is a phase and that it's all going to be a learning experience that both will benefit from (personal experience) there's lots of help available for caregivers and you never should feel that you're alone in this or it's a unmanageable burden.  


I'll never allow my father to go back into a memory care after seeing what happens there to the people trapped within.  I know, some people have no choice in the matter but I regret listening to the doctors and social workers and their recommendations.   
I lost a great deal of what was my father just in those few months he was in such (highly rated) facilities.
Sundowning is simply the behavior and speech getting more dysfunctional later in the day.  I'm not a researcher, but my guess is that it's just a diseased brain getting tired as the day wears on.",2022-03-01 13:36:12,wolfhaley206,t4eunx
Alzheimers,Fiance's dad might have Alzheimer's - should she contact his job?,"Her mom has voiced her concerns with her dad's recent behavior - being forgetful, worsening reading comprehension, short fuse and saying things that are rude or hurtful then moments later wondering why he'd say those things. My fiance is wondering if she should contact his job to find out if he's been having any issues at work. 

Would this be something that is okay to do? What are other steps she could take instead of the above? Any help is appreciated.","I wouldn’t recommend doing it yet unless he has a trusted work friend you could ask off the record. HR or a boss might find a way to fire him if they become aware that he might be a liability, especially without a clear medical diagnosis. Take him to a doctor first and have reversible causes of cognitive impairment and mood changes ruled out. Work can be sorted out later once a diagnosis/prognosis is clear.
Absolutely not.  Let's say there is nothing wrong besides low testosterone or maybe a vitamin deficiency.  Contacting his job about this will have them on the warpath to fire him.

What she should do is have him go to his doctor ""for a physical"" on any pretext whatsoever - wellness check, blood pressure, whatever.  Then without letting her dad know, she contacts the doctor or the practice's nurse before the appointment, explain the concerns (with details) and request a screening test.
Absolutely not. If your fiance's mother and father have concerns, or even just the mother, then they should go to his primary care doctor and leave the diagnosis up to the doctor. He spends enough time at home and with his family to identify if he's having issues. I can't possibly see a benefit of contacting his job and plenty of negatives.
It would be entirely unethical for his coworkers or supervisors to answer these questions. 

It would be illegal for a doctor to discuss this with anyone other than the patient. 

Fiancé’s dad has a right to privacy. And your concern does not outweigh that right. If you believe he’s endangering himself or others, or is no longer competent to make decisions about his own care and finances, you can seek guardianship or conservatorship. 

Until that happens, you’ll have to talk to him.
I work in HR. I would be very uncomfortable personally to receive this request, but legally I would not be able to comment anyways. It would draw my attention to the person, which may not be s good thing depending on the workplace. Would not recommend this approach. As another poster said, if there is a longtime friend who is also a colleague, that could be an option. Ultimately the door is your best choice for determining what is happening.
Definitely not the right move to approach his job and ask. If he's having issues at work they will figure it out soon enough and they will sort it out if that means a dismissal so be it. But don't give them any ammunition to let him go with cause. That could have impacts on benefits severance etc. 

Get his doctor to assess.

My mom was self-employed and she got dropped by her clients over the course of a year. I didn't have to say anything to them, they saw her performance/cognition decline and acted based on that.
Diagnosis first. Also see if he has any applicable disability or long-term care insurance.
Thank you all for the helpful responses. I wholeheartedly agree with the option of getting him to the doctor, the problem is getting him there. He's a very stubborn, very ""proud"" man who always has the wife go to the doctor in his place and have her describe his symptoms.
When my mom started having issues, my dad got permission from my mom to contact her boss (she was a law clerk for a city judge, long time friend) and they discussed what she was having problems with and possible ways to help her. It turned out she needed to retire - they were asking her to start using new technology which was stressful for her since learning new things was difficult for her. It worked out in our case only because her boss was a family friend of ours and someone was advocating for her as her caregiver. Everyone’s situation is different but it was what was best for my mom.
If they have an HR dept, that may be a little better than going to a supervisor. If a person’s personality is changing, and especially if they don’t know why, you have to take steps you wouldn’t normally take. It’s worth a conversation, maybe a coworker if nothing else.",2022-02-28 23:05:37,SSJRosaaayyy,t3yugh

Alzheimers,Dad in denial and refusing to seek appropriate care for Mum,"Hi all, I'm located in Nova Scotia, Canada.  
My 78-year-old mum was finally formally diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia in January. I say ""finally"" because her symptoms have been progressing rapidly for the last 18 months but  my father, nearly 86, her primary caregiver, kept dismissing everything - including delusions, confirmed by her family doctor - as age-related memory loss.  My sister and I were hopeful that once an expert told him it's something much more serious, he'd be more open to seeking supports like a meal service and home care. He's trying to care for mum and manage the house and just failing dismally; they developed a fruit-fly infestation before Christmas due to the state of the kitchen, couldn't stay on top of kitty litter boxes (the last cat has, mercifully, passed) and Mum is not bathing on a regular basis.  
But...having gone through the MMSE with a score of 10/30, and despite a very clear and specific report from a geriatrician emphasizing the importance of home care, dad is still in denial. He says he'll look into home care ""when he feels it's appropriate,"" despite fully admitting that he will do anything to avoid conflict with mum, which results in her not bathing or eating regularly; and that he struggles to stay on top of laundry and basic housekeeping (hence fruit flies.) My sister and I spent most of last week cleaning the house, sorting and cleaning mum's clothes, and generally decluttering the house to make it more navigable; but she adamantly refused to bathe; we also had several very tense discussions with dad in which he repeated all of the above or just insisted he was managing and then stopped talking to us.  
He grudgingly contacted the provincial Alzheimer's society last week at my/my sister's insistence (and I should mention that the society apparently reached out to him after receiving a referral from the geriatrician - but he didn't return the message and tried to claim he'd never heard from them, which we have verified as a lie.) The society could be his link to home care resources and other supports - but my concern is that he will continue to downplay/deny mum's condition and refuse any and all supports.  
So...I have medical power of attorney for both of them and our province has a legal mechanism to revoke his guardianship but I'm in need of some help to determine when to exercise these nuclear options. He's running himself ragged and not caring for mum appropriately; they're bound and determined to stay in their home, but we don't have any confidence at all that that's a safe option unless he agrees to regular home care. Should I consult an attorney? Contact the province with concerns about his guardianship? Wait to see if he agrees to homecare? If so...how \*long\* do I wait?Many thanks for any insights, and my love to everyone else dealing with the many, many facets of this condition.","Man, this will only get worse and the longer you wait, the more your mother will suffer. I’m dealing with the same situation from a distance but it’s with friends who’s family is asleep at the wheel. I spent the weekend with them to see what’s going on. The women with Alzheimer’s is literally dying of starvation and dehydration cause she is so sick from a urinary tract infection she can’t eat/drink and needs coaxing. She doesn’t complain so the husband thinks she’s ok, but she thinks her husband is trying to kill her- she’s terrified. Your mom will stop eating and drinking, if she hasn’t already. She’ll need to be coaxed to take beverages and your dad is not equipped. I feel bad I didn’t step in sooner, as the woman is really sick now. But I called local health services, I’m in BC, set up a visit, and had a come to Jesus conversation with the family. And the refusing the bathe is common, my friend refuses. But a professional health care worker would know how to handle it. Don’t wait till dad agrees… it may never happen and your mother will suffer. My heart goes out to you and your sister. This is such a horrible disease.
So sorry yellowsmoke, that's really tough.  Good on you & yr sis for getting in there & getting on with it, what you could.

Alzheimers,Calorie dense foods,"Hello all. My grandpa has Alzheimer's, and honestly it hasn't gotten to a very bad state yet. But heres the issue my family is facing. My grandpa always thinks he has already eaten. If you ask him, he says he already ate, so he ends up not eating unless we give him food. He will only drink tea and eat a piece of bread otherwise. Does anyone have any advice for calorie dense foods i can give him, just so he doesnt starve himself? Hes from Bolivia, and he goes there for a few months in a year, and this last time he came back so skinny, basically skin and bones. But at the same time, because hes from another country he thinks any american food will kill him. So we can't give him the average american meal thats is usually calorie dense.","Try some Ensure. Can you make empanadas? Do not ask him if he has eaten, instead tell him it's suppertime.
Pick up some bakery treats from a Latinx bakery, if you have any in your area.  Or find a restaurant in your area that has South American cuisine and try to get some takeout from there.
We used  protein shakes for my Mom. It helped keep her calorie intake where it needed  to be.
With my grandmother, it's very rare for her to say that she is hungry. Usually if I can get her to try a few bites, then she will usually eat more. But it's definitely a struggle. She was sick for a couple of weeks and lost quite a bit of weight.
My mum wouldn't eat properly for ages and when I made her food she would get angry and say she's already eaten. It wasn't until I put food vlogs on Youtube (particularly Mark Weins) that my mum started to eat again, really worked for me especially when the vlogger talks straight to the camera. My mum started having her meals with a video, maybe there's a Bolivian food vlogger your grandpa might like you could show him,Good luck anyway",2022-02-27 20:54:46,Professional_Peach,t33u4r
Alzheimers,My nana is suddenly severely declining,"My Nana has had Alzheimer’s for 14 years, (I’m 17) and I only really noticed how bad it was when she moved into memory care. She couldn’t come over for Holidays and has bad sundowning. I learned this week that she’s declining fast and has been getting angry with the staff (NOT like her at all) and now she can barely verbalize. She’s 83. Im terrified of the day she forgets who I am? Please, I need to know how to get through this.","\*hugs\*

&#x200B;

I have been experiencing something very similar with my father... He was just a little forgetful for a long time, and then, suddenly, during and after a hospital stay in the summer, he began sharply spiraling downwards. Now... he's aggressively accusing his caregivers, me included, of stealing from him.

It has been a very difficult few months.. but what I have learned is.... take a deep breath, take each day as it comes, don't expect too much from yourself (small steps), and make sure you have a hobby you can indulge in that is effective in distracting you.... My poison in that regard is computer games, as well as books, but it can be anything that allows you some respite and escape. Maybe all of that sounds cliche, but I've found it definitely helps... 

There are also some good resources out there that provide advice on how to handle conversations. Above all, though, don't contradict any lapses into non-reality that your grandmother might have... just... go with it, and be as inventive/creative as you need to be.
sudden declines should warrant a test for UTI.
It is hard, and I don't know what the best coping strategy is.  My wife briefly forgot who I am a few times in the last few months but oddly, it wasn't as jarring as I expected it would be. I know that she is still in there,  that her world is changing and that my responsibility and respect for her is the same.  I wish we could enjoy our \[formerly\] shared memories and that we could communicate as we once did, but she is to me what she always was.  I don't know if that sounds positive or not, or if it is helpful or not, but it is a way to look at this at least.

As for the fast decline, there are 2 things that many people, both with dementia and without, respond to  with cognitive decline; dehydration and urinary tract infections.  It may be the disease causing the decline (probably is, in fact) but making sure she has sufficient hydration and doesn't have a UTI are worth pursuing, especially if staff may not be seeing it. (FWIW, I know 2 elderly people who've had UTIs in the last 2 weeks).

Stay strong. Give your Nana love and attention, even if she can't let you know what it means to her.
Sudden declines and changes in personality are often signs of a UTI. My father, who has never been angry with me a day in his life, was very angry at Christmas. I insisted we get him tested for a UTI. My sister, who’s a doctor, said it probably wasn’t a UTI because he wasn’t urinating more than usual. Turns out it was a UTI. We also had him put on a low dose of Seroquel for his mood. One month later he was still getting angry with staff so his doctor increased his Seroquel and now he is in a good mood again.

Alzheimer’s is a gradual decline. Sudden declines are something to look in to.",2022-02-26 18:22:51,MusicLife16,t2a06n
Alzheimers,"The new tablet boxes my grandmas pharmacy give out. Left to right, the days go backwards and so does time. How is anyone supposed to follow this if on their own?",,"what does the back side look like? if you put it upside down as many would to push the pills out, this configuration makes sense
These are designed like bi-folds, meaning they have front and back for dispensing. It actually makes perfect sense when it’s set up correctly, and is a standard for medication compliance.

Here is an example to help better illustrate it:

https://youtu.be/BY1HhnYmh3Y
That’s so annoying. It’s almost as if someone intentionally made it as difficult as possible.  I’d complain loudly to the pharmacy about it.
I wonder if whoever thought it up meant for it to be held vertically by a right hand person. The next dose is always the furthest right to prevent breaking through the other cells unintentionally.

That being said, it’s a horrible design, I agree.
That's enough to give someone dementia if they don't already have it.
Maybe white out or put tape over the days and rewrite them in the order you prefer?
My MIL stopped being able to figure this out for herself within about 4 months of her Alz/vascular dementia diagnosis. She also managed to take all of her evening medication at once one day.

Alzheimers,Seizure,"My dad (69) has been dealing with early onset Alzheimer’s for about 7 years(ish) now. His neurologist thinks it’s directly related to the massive scar tissue he has from a brain aneurysm he suffered when he was 29. His decline has been rapid in the last year, with his days mostly consisting of sleeping/resting for the last few months. 

Yesterday he had a grand mal seizure. My mom called an ambulance and they took him to the local ER. He was released later that night on anti seizure meds . She’s set up appointments with his GP and neuro for the next few weeks. He thinks it’s 1992 and is very, very confused. His speech is all over the place and he’s far more regressed than he was two days ago. Has anyone else experienced this with a loved one? Did they “recover” back to where they were pre-seizure? Just trying to wrap my head around what to expect.","My mother was having frequent seizures for a while (5 or so years) , with infrequent seizures going back 30 years. I don't believe the doctors found the cause, she had scans etc. One doctor said it was epilepsy bought on by caffeine so we cut coffee out of the diet. She hadn't had any report of epilepsy prior to this doctor. The seizures were still there though gradually went away, likely as we were making other changes to her diet (removing unnecessary medication, increasing salt intake to compensate for low blood pressure). They've stopped about a year ago though. We're giving her caffeine again with no seizures. She is still recovering, though has alzheimer's so we don't know how far she will recover. I'm trying lots of different things so don't take my reply as what to expect.
Mum had a seizure a few months ago and was promptly put on anti-seizure medication. Normally they wait for a second but with her Alzheimer's couldn't risk it. She doesn't remember the whole day at all, which I think is really good. They suspect she also had a stroke 
so she has one aspirin a day too.

She bounced back pretty quickly after that luckily.d

Alzheimers,Help needed. Grandfather getting kicked from Florida MemoryCare facility due to violence.,"Hi /r/alzheimers - i'm not sure where to go to ask for help. Last month my mother moved her father into memorycare down in Florida. He had been living with my aunt and uncle at their house with my grandmother (his wife) in the West Palm Beach area, but it got to a breaking point of not being able to care for him. Today we were told he is being kicked out after physically assaulting a nurse for a 2nd time resulting in the nurse being sent to a hospital. My mother is scrambling to find a new facility that can care for him, as moving him back into my aunt's house is just out of the question.

Alzheimers,Finding Clinical Trials More Easily,"Hi all!

We are a group of graduate students at Stanford looking to better understand patients' experiences with clinical trials.

Specifically, we’re working on a project that aims to match people with trials more quickly and easily than many of the existing, cumbersome methods.

We’ve created a survey (below) that we hope gives you the chance to voice your own experiences finding therapies that work.

Alzheimers,Add sweeteners to food?,"My mom will only eat thing that are warm, soft, and sweet. And more and more, if it's not sweet, she won't eat it. She always has room for ice cream, for example, but is just ""way too full"" to eat another bite of soup. We rely heavily on Ensure (which she's now starting to pour into everything she eats) and she's well past the point where we're worried about getting her a healthy or even balanced diet.  We need her to eat, period. 

But... I'm wondering if adding stevia or something similar to her soup or potatoes would help her appreciate them more. Have you had any success with this? Appreciate any tips!","Replace the foods that don't appeal to her with ones that do. I serve foods that have lots of flavor and are on the sweet side naturally: sweet potato puffs (like tater tots) with a dipping sauce, asian noodles with sweet sauces, tapioca pudding, teriyaki sauce on butterfish, cinnamon toast with lots of butter and peanut butter served with banana, Bread with butter and jam, lots of craisins in oatmeal, etc. Experiment and see what she likes. Ice cream, banana splits, and shakes are fine. If you are making your own ice cream shake you can add some protein powder. Adding a sweetener to the same food she's been eating does not sound appealing at all and stevia in particular can have side effects.
The last 6 months for my mom everything had to have honey on it.  Tacos? Honey.  Hamburger? Honey. Soup? Honey. 

It didn't matter.  As long as food was going in her body.
I've heard people with this disease do prefer food that is more heavily seasoned, and also prefer sweets.  I know my husband loves his desserts and ice cream.  Tonight we had pancakes for dinner with maple syrup and sliced strawberries.  Not a terribly healthy meal (no protein to speak of) but he loved it.

Why use Stevia though?  My husband slowly loses weight without trying.  A lot of the time he has little appetite, though he does eat all of whatever I offer him.  I would probably just use sugar.  I don't think Stevia is harmful, but it's more expensive, isn't it?
Fake sugar products- natural or not, are bad period. Your taste buds tell your pancreas, hey sugars coming, kick up the insulin, (or whatever) and then no sugar comes. But insulin rages in the blood stream. Real sugar is better. This guys says it better. https://youtu.be/dBnniua6-oM",2022-02-22 17:04:24,KLK1712,syzr7p

I’m so very sorry. 😞
Ohhh, sorry for yr loss, sorry for the added distress grandpa instigating, it's real hard.  Poor grandpa, so distressed & trying to do the right thing for missing grandma.  Have you set up a memorial for grandma on a shelf or somewhere, for grandpa?  

  My mum is starting to ask about relatives who've died years ago, some decades ago - at least she's not calling cops.  We have a memorial shelf.  Sometimes all the photies / memorial booklets go in a drawer for a few weeks / months, when she starts asking again they'll come back out for a while.  Must be so hard for them.  Drives me nuts but sad, when she insists her grandma who brought her up can't be dead - mum, she passed away 45 yrs ago already!  ... :(
Maybe turn his cell phone off (or let the battery die & dont recharge) or unplug from the wall? This coupled with the other suggestion that she is ""away from the house"" might help with the unnecessary calling of authorities.

Alzheimers,Vent: Talking on the phone sucks,"My grandma is progressing and speaking with her on the phone absolutely sucks. She was given a new phone that is a wall phone but since the buttons are on the phone, she accidentally pressed them just to confuse herself and hangs up thinking it’s someone else calling her. 

I’m one of the few grandkids (she’s very luck and has 15) she still adores and remembers. I actively call her once a week and the conversations are getting increasingly harder to follow. I’m very patient and she can still form thoughts but it takes so much longer. She also really only talks about what is actually in front of her. She doesn’t remember what she’s eaten an hour before or who she spoke to today. 

I know she loves the phone calls so of course I’ll continue especially since I know she won’t be able to talk or communicate at all. Im just so mad that the last of “easy” ways of communications are going to shit. It’s so sad.","I feel this so hard. I am sorry you are going though this. It really is so hard. 

My grandmothers dementia is progressing and it's also getting harder for us to communicate, especially through the phone as well. Luckily she lives close enough where I can do in person visits daily, but her other grandchildren never call her for your exact reason. It breaks my heart that her other grandchildren never call her because speaking on the phone is just so frustrating. I do know that my grandmother knows they aren't calling and it makes her feel sad and disconnected. I don't push them to call anymore, but I wish they would just take the 5 minutes and deal with it to make her happy. 

It's especially sad cause my grandma use to be on the phone for hours with her friends gossiping etc. It's so sad to watch this disease take everything away from you. 

My heart goes out to you
I have a similar situation, except it's my Grandpa. I am the only person who calls to talk to him, even though my grandma and I have warned my Mom and uncle for years this was going to happen.

I call every other week because any more stresses him out, and he thinks I'm his daughter (my mom), I don't mind because it makes him happy, but it also makes me more angry at her because this could have been avoided.
I'm sorry! My mother-in-law is going through the same thing. One of the grandkids called her, and they had a 20 minute conversation where my MIL thought she was talking to a HS classmate who moved to Boston after school. She mentioned the call to my husband just after it happened, & he knew who she had spoken to. When he mentioned her name, it took her a minute to say ""oh."" It's good you call regularly and she can remember you still! The conversations are a challenge, for sure.
My gramma got to the point where she would forget to hang her phone up, if she found the phone to answer it in the first place.  I had previously set up an Alexa for her, while her memory was still good enough to use it (with the help of a cheat sheet).  So when using the phone became too challenging I could still drop in and see her and talk to her...  though it did confuse her as she often thought I was actually there with her and that shocked/surprised her in the beginning (before she got the the full acceptance stage).  I also found that once a week wasn't enough and even if we just spoke for 15 minutes a day it did wonders for her.",2022-02-22 14:43:15,kiwi1325,sywe44

Alzheimers,reducing shadowing/codependency?,"my mother was codependent with my father before he passed away.  they both exhibited narcissistic behaviors as well.  she gained some friends before her dementia really increased, and then she effectively stopped all of those relationships because of paranoia.

So now she shadows me (i’ve lived with her since my father passed away) and is just continuing her codependent behavior with me.

this might seem a silly question if i read it myself, but when you’re in the situation sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees.

is the only way for me to reduce her shadowing and codependent behavior (toward me anyway) by removing myself physically from her presence?

i want to ask for some companion care help to start coming by, with the idea that a) it’s another person and b) they might take her on outings to meet even more people.  but i have the feeling that while she still has me to concentrate on, she won’t give other people a chance.  she also already dismissed adult day care centers as “babysitting”.

i want to stay home and get things done.  but should i be looking into moving out instead?  it seems so drastic, but…?

TIA.  bless you all for hanging in there.","What exactly do you mean when you say she is codependent with you?  Do  you mean heavily dependent?

In classic psychology terms, co-dependent means someone has an enabling effect on someone else's problematic behavior in sort of a barter for that other person's continuing connection and support.  But I don't see you being enabled in any way in exchange for helping her.
would she consider attending the adult day program, not as a participant herself but as a “volunteer”? talk to the staff there, they can ask her to do some small tasks to make her feel useful and not like one of the patients being babysat. 

otherwise, adopting a cat or pair of cats to play with, would occupy her time, at least distract her from whatever you’re doing. but of course only do this if you’re actually willing to take on the cats if she falls through",2022-02-22 07:11:42,gromit5,sym5gb
Alzheimers,Mom talked like she used to for the first time since she was diagnosed,"I’m on mobile so the formatting will be bad.

So I was driving back from a neighboring state today because my dad had to pick up his motorcycle from his parents and I drove back. We took my mom with us so she was in the car with me on the way back. I was doing really well until my dad had to get gas.

I parked in a good spot and was really proud of myself because it was kinda small between the rows of places. So when my dad was done, I began to back out. The car stopped and I thought “oh, I’m probably close to a car or something” (even though the beeper didn’t go off), so I put it in drive and slowly turned. Long story short, I ran over the curb on my front and back left tire. I was pissed because I was doing so well and fucked it up.

When I had to make upturn when we pulled out of the station, the 4 wheel drive turned on and the car was making a skidding sound and I couldn’t move faster. My knee is where the button is and my knee probably hit it. There was a car coming (not fast and in the left lane, I was in the right) so that just fueled my anger and I was obviously pissed. My mom then said to me, “you don’t need to get upset about it. You’re doing a great job.” She didn’t raise her voice, there wasn’t any anger or irritation in it at all. It was calm and reassuring. She didn’t say anything bad about the mess up and told me to focus on how good I was driving.

I haven’t heard her talk like that since she got sick. It was the clearest I hard her in years. Yeah some words were jumbled, but it was like she was normal again. It was like that the rest of the way back home. Before we pulled into the gas station, she was gasping when I would switch lanes and when we’d go by trucks, but for some reason the gas station is where she changed. Obviously when we got back she went back to how she has been, but holy shit it hit me hard. As we driver back, I kept it going because I wanted to experience her somewhat older self for as long as I could.","My wife doesn't really talk but got out of bed at 3 am and said ""time for you to get up"".

Alzheimers,On month 10 of hospice.,"Hi all, 

My dad was dx with early onset Alzheimer's in 2013. By last April, he had stopped walking, eating/drinking and all the end stage business. He's not verbal.

He went into a memory care unit and has been under hospice since. 

In hospice he ""recovered"" a bit, insofar as they feed him enough to keep him alive. But he's still nonverbal and in a wheelchair. I visit him 1-2x a week. I wish I could see him more, but I work, have a husband and 3 kids. 

I'm just kind of struggling with this today. He was a great person. An incredible, intelligent, awesome dad and a good partner to my mom for nearly 40 years. He doesn't deserve to suffer as he does. And I feel selfish saying that I'm tired of being gutted watching him go through it. 

Any advice?","My MIL is a hospice social worker and she has told me numerous times at some point everyone always thinks ""I just wish they would die"". 
There is no shame in thinking that because death is exhausting. It's not nice but watching a loved one slowly wither away a long death is horrid.

I have no advice other than it's ok you feel this way and I hope he finds peace soon. 

My own Mother is only recently diagnosed with this fucking hell disease and I've already thought ""cancer would have been easier"". Right now she's just angry all the time and Dad keeps calling me to help him. (We are still in the process of getting in home help for him).

Breathe and keep doing what you can. You have no judgment from me. This disease sucks.
I don’t have any advice. I think talking with the social worker might help you process these feelings. It’s natural to feel awful watching someone we love be sick and decline. It’s understandable to grieve the person he used to be. Take care of yourself. It’s okay to adjust your visit frequency to allow yourself some relief from the pain it’s causing you. Give yourself permission to take a break.",2022-02-21 18:35:16,TheLadyBard,sy83ti
Alzheimers,What is the point of a diagnosis?,"We have been fighting for a diagnosis for my MIL (67) for years and the doctors dismiss it. She also vehemently fights it insisting we are all conspiring against her.

Long story short, we all know her well enough and spend enough time with her to know she isn’t right and we don’t need a diagnosis to tell us what’s happening.

What advantage is there so continuing to pursue a diagnosis? It creates a lot of conflict and tension for my FIL to fight that battle. The only advantage i can think of is if the medications are effective but the reading I’ve done makes it seem like that’s questionable? I’m happy to be wrong about this though…","The diagnosis allows for the application for medical and financial power of attorney. It also (in some countries) makes you eligible for medical support.
We needed a diagnosis for every kind of support we got. I don’t even want to think about how hard the whole situation would have been if we didn’t get a diagnosis. Try to get it sooner than later because you will regret not getting it.
Not sure where you live, but my understanding is that in the US a diagnosis will be required to apply for any aid or services from Medicaid for example.

US healthcare system is an absolute nightmare.
I found in our case that getting a diagnosis for my mother helped my father understand that she wasn't turning into someone else on purpose. She got super unreasonable and mean pretty quickly - which was not how she was before at all. He really struggled with NOT getting angry with her and lashing out when she would start in on him (daily) for some perceived slight on his part. Being able to talk to him and coach him through how to handle her behavior and focus on the ""it's the disease, not Mom"" was really helpful.

We've since moved mom into MC and I live with Dad, and I'm trying to get HIM to see a neuro just to see where we stand, because he forgets a lot of things but is still able to function. He just doesn't remember to eat and often forgets his medicine. There's also a bit of unreasonable anger coming from him randomly that I would love to know if it's just the situation or if I should be bracing myself for his decline into dementia. However, he is refusing to go and got over-the-top angry and said he was ""insulted"" that anyone thought he should go see the neurologist. Which of course, verifies my concerns. 

Knowing what is going on allows a person to prepare. I've already got all the legal paperwork in hand and I have set up online access to all their banking, but just knowing what's coming, or might be coming, would be a good thing. Living with clarity is highly underrated, especially when there is so much about this disease that is never clear.
I do diagnostic tests on people with potential dementia. Think 'draw a clock' 'plan this hypothetical route' '100-7-7-7-7' etc.  

It's often clear that there's a type of dementia prior to the diagnostic appointment. The type (wernicke korsakov, vascular, Alzheimer, Lewy Body, Parkinsons) can tell a lot about the likely progression and likely problems they will encounter. The tests help point out which areas might need support first, and even help suggest which medication might be advisable(anti psychotic meds tend to worsen the lewy body hallucinations, instead of helping them).

And when the point is reached that subsidized care is needed, organisations often want an official diagnosis. 

And yet in the end, the diagnosis doesn't change anything for the patient.
Diagnosis is incredibly helpful in accessing LTC and Disability benefits if she is employed.  Leaving a job with a disability as opposed to quitting can gain access to benefits through your employer.  

The rivastigmine (generic name) helped give my wife several boosts as they upped the med levels and namenda greatly helps with pseudobulbar affect.  Not everyone benefits from the meds and they won’t cure anything, but they can help with symptoms.  These can also be prescribed by a primary care doctor as needed for symptoms, so don’t necessarily need a diagnosis.
In my experience, the diagnosis is unnecessary and highly traumatic to your loved one.  Your loved one will only become confused, resentful and depressed by the process.  There is almost nothing to be gained other than potentially making him/her someone's guinea pig.  Alzheimers is generally treated like memory loss from aging, where you manage the symptoms rather than treat the disease.

The way that people qualify for insurance help is through the assessment of their Activities of Daily Living, and how much help they require to get thru the day with things like dressing, eating, bathing, etc.  Once a memory care patient requires a certain amount of help, they may become qualified for additional long-term insurance (if you hav the right plan).  This diagnosis is provided and signed off by his/her doctor.  The hardest part is that they have to deteriorate to that level in order to qualify for help.

There is no standard medical treatment for Alzheimer's, so there is no diagnosis required for insurance.  It was never an issue for my mom.  All medical care for your alzheimers patient will be just like anyone else's care, for whatever typical ailments occur on a daily basis.

It's my understanding that a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimers can only be confirmed post-mortem, and there's no need to prove that someone has the disease clinically beyond an educated medical opinion based on behavioral observations.  The legal issues can all be resolved by getting a comprehensive Durable Power of Attorney and health directive from your loved one.

There were so many great responses here about POA, legal stuff, etc (and that some people generally feel safer when things are labelled … not the person with the label necessarily, but others). 

From my experience, so long as they can “give permission to speak on their behalf”, a diagnosis is rarely asked for or even looked at (this was the case with financial stuff and Medicaire for my mom). IMO this is revolting, and the diagnosis or medical liaison should be necessary for any of this (how the hell can you trust ‘giving permission’, when the person doesn’t recognize their own son / daughter/ spouse?)
A diagnosis allows everyone to get on the same page and start treating this as a brain disease and not as a passing stage, a psychiatric or volitional problem.  It takes years of damage out of family relationships.  It permits people to get into clinical trials.  

She might not want to know, that's also her right.",2022-02-21 12:12:53,shelovescompletely,sxyqeg

Alzheimers,21 and my mom got alzheimers 2 weeks ago,What can i do to help and support???,"First of all, I’m so sorry about your mom’s diagnosis. I’m in a similar boat; my mother got the dreaded diagnosis 20 days ago. I’ll be honest in saying that we’ve been seeing the signs for a long time now.

The best thing I can offer you is to be aware of everything that’s available to you.  There’s a lot of stuff that needs to be worked out: power of attorney, who’s going to take the responsibility for medical decisions on your mother’s behalf, and lots of other things.

The best thing I can offer you is to look up the stories of those who have been the caregivers of someone with Alzheimer’s.  Here is two I can recommend: 

https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4907822

Big Clive’s story about caring for his mother: https://youtu.be/jRltbhRO-sY
Wow, that's awful...how old is your mom? We learned of my mom diagnosis when she was in her early 70's, and its been a long grueling experience to say the least, but the horrendous part started about 5 years ago, and she is still with us now at age 87 but is at the very late stage 7 now and has been completely bedridden now for almost 16 months. Most cases don't last this long from what I've heard, my mom seems to be the exception to the rule.",2022-02-19 21:01:29,fm1406,swpyvn
Alzheimers,Pap passed away on Jan 31st.,"I spent years taking care of my pap and I couldn’t bear watching the disease take him anymore. He basically slept all day and couldn’t function much at all. Towards the end of last year I started to feel upset as I watched his skin start to break down, I tried my best to tend to his body. I was also fighting with my dad because nobody wanted to put pap on hospice, I did the brunt of the work and we all needed help. 

On January 4th I sat down and wrote a post to this group. I was broken, sad, and feeling unheard. I could only be so grateful for the advice I received. I remember sitting in the bathroom in tears typing back to all of you, and then I prayed to God. That he would please take my pap so he could rest. He seemed miserable and I couldn’t do it anymore. Immediately after, he started declining very fast. 

Early in the month he began shutting his eyes more and barely wanted to sit up. I’d have to hold him up while spoon feeding him, all with his eyes closed. The week of Jan 17th I noticed his chewing get slower, and slower, and slower. By Jan 24th he was just holding the food in his mouth, getting just 1-2 bites down each meal. By this time pap wasn’t talking for weeks, just mumbling. But when I laid him down that day I told him I loved him, and he said I love you back as clear as day. By Jan 26th he stopped swallowing liquids and food completely. I worked those two weeks straight and stayed by his side. After that, the doctor said all we had to do was lay him in bed and wait. By then he was very weak and stayed asleep all day. By Jan 30th, I admit I was scared. He was losing weight so fast and he looked worse by the hour. He was nothing but bone, I remember how light he felt. I was hoping he wouldn’t linger to long. I arrived the next day and found him resting peacefully for good.

Wherever you are pap, please stand by me. I’ll miss you terribly. For all of you out there, stay strong. Everything comes to an end eventually. Please wish me luck as I’m trying to find my next job. Help me out pap! Lol.","So sorry for your loss. In the midst of your grief, I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you did absolutely everything you could for your Pap. Even though he may not have been able to express it, he surely felt your loving presence with him on this journey. And now I hope you can feel HIS presence when you need it the most.
I am sorry for your loss.
Wishing you gentle moments.
Sending our thoughts to you OP. Cherish the good times and have a great life.

Alzheimers,"Me, my mom and her neighbour","Hi, I was a domiciliary carer in 2019 for 12 months, so spent time with clients with alzheimers and dementia, the experience of which has been useful for my mom, because her neighbour has been diagnosed with alzheimers - and the poor woman is getting very little support. Mom, herself 81 years old, does what she can, which is admirable, considering her neighbour has been horrible to her well before the illness even began.

I know things can't carry on as they are, so I'm joining groups for support and advice, and in time, I may be able to help others.","It's so kind of you to help her.  This disease is awful and so difficult.  Does she have family?  Someone is going to have to help her with financial issues later on.  You might contact your local agency for the aging to help advocate for her.  She will not be able to live on her own at some point.  Best of luck.
Thank you. She has a half-sister, who visits occasionally, and a friend. We understand she has 'safeguarding', but we don't really know what that means.

We keep an eye out, it's all we can do. She goes to the supermarket regularly to buy booze (very worrying - we've alerted her sister) and also keeps going to the bank to take out money, loses it in the house, then goes and gets more.

It's just so difficult, only being neighbours - she doesn't even have carers going in, because she refuses the help - but she clearly needs it because her personal care is non-existent. It's so sad.",2022-02-20 05:31:21,danger_of_biscuits,swyfgx
Alzheimers,What were some early signs that you noticed in your loved one with dementia?,"My mother is 57 and I’m worried about her. She is her normal self, but over the past years she has been a little bit forgetful and she doesn’t care too much about cleaning as much anymore. Is there a way that she can be diagnosed early? If she is found to be in the early stages is there anyway to slow the process?","I would look into long term care insurance before seeking a diagnosis.
My father first had symptoms at 60, his sense of direction became really bad and he would get lost in unfamiliar places. He also would forget *important* events he was told about, like a family member losing a pregnancy. He was always an absent-minded professor type, but he started to forget significant things and not just mundane daily events. 
He lived for 16 years after that, and it was only in the last 3 years that he started to need more constant care. 
We were lucky that he was diagnosed early, my mother is a wizard when it comes to navigating medical care and bureaucracy. Medications definitely slowed down the progress of the illness, and he had a very good quality of life for most of it. 

I hope your mother can get effective treatment, and that you get emotional and practical support to help make the best decisions for you all
She had her roof replaced twice in two years and insisted it hasn't been done in 20. And there were personality changes, like she started making irresponsible decisions when she had always been ultra responsible. And her math skills went downhill. I noticed when she was about 65 but she wasn't dx until 71.
Please just try to get her tested. My mother refused to go see a neurologist 7 years ago and now she is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. You have nothing to lose.
Personality changes were the first. My mother was never a bubbly sweet lady so at first it was hard to tell. She was always kind of a jealous woman but suddenly she would affix her attention to one random woman who she felt my dad paid too much attention too. She became really strict and lost her patience with my nephews; wanted them to sit still and be quiet when kids can’t really do that. She began discussing same topics over and over without necessarily repeating herself so it was not super obvious. Also began doing weird things when she cooked like odd food combinations or not using proper instruments to cook with. Def get a diagnosis asap, PCP often are not well versed and will say oh its just aging. PCP like to use verbal tests that have patients repeat animals, dates, numbers etc and often people can pass these up until the mid stages. I would recommend asking for a referral to see a neurologist that specializes in dementia/elderly to get an early diagnosis and get her on medication that might slow the progress. Not all meds work for every patient but it could work. Advocate for her. If you know she is changing put pressure on the Drs. Good luck!!
My Mom started telling the same stories about work or friends or whatever on repeat. At first we thought maybe she’d just had one too many glasses of wine or that she was just tired. She forgot my Dad’s birthday and their wedding anniversary a of couple years in a row. She started wearing the same couple of outfits constantly and stopped caring about her physical appearance. All things that were easy to dismiss at first, but when combined started to become evident there was something very wrong. She was diagnosed at age 59.
Our family doctor said, ""If you mislay your keys, that's normal aging.  But if you forget what a key is *for*, that's dementia.""

Very simple formula that gives you a yardstick of sorts.

OP, from your opening post I would not worry yet.",2022-02-20 07:06:18,Des_demona,swzw2j
Alzheimers,My Mom thinks I stole something from her—any thoughts on how to approach moving past it?,"My Mom was very recently diagnosed in January—up until just the last month or so her issues have been mostly benign and memory related, but now she has come to believe I stole something from her house.

At first she wouldn’t even say what it was, just that “I knew what I took” but she was mad enough she nearly hit me. Eventually we got it out of her that it was a two pages she had taken out of a magazine—needless to say I hadn’t even seen them let alone took them.

I know this isn’t an uncommon sort of thing with Alzheimer’s… what I’m not sure about is how to get her to move on from it… it’s been many weeks now and she keeps sending me angry emails. Obviously she’d didn’t believe me when I told her I didn’t take it—any strategies for what to do now? Do I just wait it out until she forgets about it? Will she forget about it? Do I “admit” to taking the pages, tell her their destroyed and beg forgiveness? Is there some way I can give her a resolution to this?

It would be awesome if we had some idea of what they actually were or what magazine they came from, but there’s no hope of that—she’s become obsessed with cutting stuff out of magazines and putting them in binders and on display all over the house so there’s no chance we’d be able to track it down.","You could try giving her two pages out of a magazine.  Just say you came across it in a drawer. Try to pick something she’s interested in.  This has worked for me on occasion.  Doesn’t always work or sometimes only works for a day, but worth a shot.
Sorry you are going through this. In early stage, MIL developed a lot of anger around these perceived and imaginary wrongs. I don't think there's anything you can do except to know that this idea will leave her mind eventually. My advice is just to be patient. In the meantime if there is anything that she enjoys or that calms her down (art, music), you can try to put her in a better state of mind through these activities. Stay strong.
This thread is so important to me! 
My mom has created a whole imaginary wrong my sister did to her. And then got REALLY REALLY MEAN. It’s terrible. 
My mom was supposed to be a central figure in my sisters wedding in September. 
I’m trying slowly and very BERY gently to talk her down. I stopped turning to convince her she got it all wrong (that just back fires BADLY because in her broken brain it’s very real), and am now talking about forgiveness… reminding her that she and I have had much bigger fights in years past and now we’re ok. 
Meanwhile, my sister and my moms granddaughter can’t have a relationship with Nana. 
I am fucking praying this passes. She forgets. Or… SOMETHING. 
My heart is breaking for my sister! ☹️😣😣😣
A simple apology whenever she brings it up and then immediately try to redirect her to a new subject or activity. Eventually she'll forget about it.
My mom, when she was still at home, did this often. I found that distracting her with something different (offering to play cards or go for a walk) worked for a while. Finally I just said ""Well, let's look for it"" an ask her very specific questions about whatever was missing. What color is it? Where did you see it last? Did you possibly take it with you anywhere? Often just feeling like she was being heard was enough. Sometimes we'd actually hunt through the house for it.  She'd invariably find the thing in some odd place where she put it. Of course she'd insist that she hadn't put it there and ""someone else must have done it"". I'd just say ""Wow - that's something but I'm so glad we found it!"" and move on. Another idea would be to offer to take her to get a new magazine that she can pick out (when you have time). 

This can be really frustrating because often there is no resolution to accusations like this. The best thing you can do is stay calm, realize that she has no idea how she's acting, and be as patient as possible. A few times we've had to just say ""Mom, I'm sorry I can't help you with this but I'm not going to talk about it anymore, and if you insist on bringing it up I'm going to go home."" You can stop responding to the emails that are on this topic, too. 

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.",2022-02-18 23:29:02,urbanabydos,sw1fkt
Alzheimers,Screening Care Facilities?,"Her condition is getting worse, beyond what we're equipped to handle. I knew we'd get to this point, I just didn't think it would happen so soon. We haven't had nearly enough time to get our ducks in a row and it's come back to bite us in the form of a last-minute scramble. 

My dad needs to call the lawyer about Medicaid so it's on me to look for potential long-term care facilities. Any suggestions on what to ask? I am in a daze. He said to ask about what care comes standard and what is extra, and I want to ask about how they handle meltdowns, but what else should I be looking for?","I'm sorry you are going through this. I was just talking to a friend about how hard it was looking for a memory care for my dad when we were trying to find him a place. I thought I knew the best questions to ask but unfortunately his facility turned out to not be so nice after all. If you can, I recommend seeing if you can stop by unscheduled (ask them if this is possible) to see how the days go. Are the residents just plopped in front of the TV all day or is someone there trying to engage them? Good idea to ask what's included. We had to pay for my dad's supplies (like diapers) and we didn't know that upfront. I would ask what their staff to resident ratio is at all times. Ask what can mean eviction; my dad got aggressive and we were asked to find him a new place while paying for additional 24/7 care from an outside agency. Go with your gut. Some places will just stand out as awful to you and you may come across one that just feels right. Trust those feelings. Good luck, OP.
I’m sorry you’re going through this. Maying [this link](https://www.thememorycenter.com/checklist-questions-to-ask-when-visiting-memory-care-communities/) could help guide you. Take care.
An unforeseen thing we ran in to was that our top choice place, after dragging things out for months, rejected our application because they said my mom required too much care. That didn't make any sense to me at all (isn't providing care their purpose?), but it made me feel like we'd waited too long to seek outside help. 

We moved her into a different place around Christmas. I wish I had a more detailed understanding of their covid visitation policies (they said that we could call ahead to arrange a visit anytime, but the reality is that we can only get on the schedule about once a week). I wish I had specific details about medical care (under which circumstances do they call paramedics? When is the RN there? How are observations about effects of med changes communicated? ). Honestly it's been a terrible experience and I think it speaks to the crises of elder care in the US.
Ask upfront what happens if there is rage. We thought that all Medicaid-approved Alzheimer's care facilities would handle rage, and then I got the call that the director of the place my mom was in and dropped her off in the ER and left. I had to call them to ask what was going on and they told me my mom's rage was not something they were equipped to deal with and therefore they would not take her back. We were welcome to get her things but that was that.

If your mom is prone to rage at all, level 3 isn't enough (at least in my state). Ask specifically for facilities with 24/7 skilled nurses on staff and not just on call.
It will be hard finding a facility that accepts Medicaid from new residents. Your best bet is to find a facility that accepts Medicaid for *current* residents after they've spent down their money through private pay. They don't want to work with patients who already spent down their assets somewhere else
Sorry to be so blatant, but it really comes down to how much you can spend, and how much attention she needs.

There are some beautiful, extravagant, wonderful facilities but way outside my price range.  We have been looking for Medicaid facilities.

There are typically two kinds of housing:  assisted living and memory care.  Patients in memory care need more help with meds, toileting, fall prevention, and so on.  As the illness progresses, patients even need someone to feed them - and eventually even that is not enough.  

You could also look into board and care homes and skilled nursing facilities that take dementia patients.

A referral service such as ""A Place For Mom"" can be helpful, but they typically don't work with anyone needing Medicaid for funding.
Make sure he has a Power of Attorney.
Get in touch with the Alzheimer’s Association. There may be a local chapter near you. Their website ( https://www.alz.org )  is very helpful. They even have a section of questions to ask when researching facilities. https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/care-options/long-term-care
Make sure you do a full cost analysis before you make a hasty decision on this. Sometimes quiting work to care for the sick to save the estate is a much smarter move in the long run. This change could end up costing well over six figures when all is said and done.",2022-02-19 02:51:01,SolemnMinh,sw4pap
Alzheimers,Early onset Alzheimers? We need some advice..please share if you experienced similiar.,"This is long. Thank you for taking time to read.

So my dad has always been a little neurotic, has had mild OCD and control issues, he has achieved great things throughout his life and his identity is tied with an immense knowledge of a million things. His mental functioning has declined noticeably from all his family members, he forgets most things like appointments (he has used a calender for years so that helps) but he says things now that aren't true, for example he says he talks on the phone to my brother frequently but not true, he said he was at Verizon for hours and his new wife said they came 30 minutes before closing, or he tells stories about his life that are way exaggerated, I don't even know if any of it is true) and recently doing anything with him has been like dealing with an insolent teenager (for example, his cell phone wasn't working right- there was a lag on the line where after he would finish speaking it would go quiet and if you talked it cut off the first 2 seconds of your reply. He blames Verizon who has excellent coverage but it was likely the phone, he did superglue a beeper tracker to the top. Who knows why but either way he wanted to switch carriers, so I take him to T-mobile and 6 hours later we leave empty handed because he complicated everything since it's his way or nothing at all, and he doesn't understand the way things work. He needed to set up a Myverizon account and he didn't remember anything about his account).

Whew that was a lot to say, but everything he needs to do is like pulling teeth, he will not listen or let me help him with simple things, and he is so confused, he doesn't remember or understand that when you get a new phone or install something for the first time you have to log in, he thought it was a scam when I went to the google play store and downloaded the mail app he uses. 

He gets obsessive and fixated on little things that he doesn't even understand how it works and is overwhelmed because he gets behind on the important things like moving into his new house.

He just turned 75. He has has weird nerve pain, was diagnosed with polymyalgiarhematica from a rhumetologist and is on prednisone (and has been for about 8 months but after lessening dose it came back hard), and now is taking hydroxyquinoline.

Long story short, he was sent to a memory specialist or something like that to do testing a couple weeks ago, there were 3 sessions, and now he is going to a memory center (outpatient I assume) my sister says, she thinks it's because his new wife who is a very loving and supportive person (my sister doesn't know her very well but I have spent a lot of time with this lady, even just us, who was his gf for the past few years and I know her well) my sister thinks she is trying to deem him mentally unfit, he made her his power-of-attorney after they got married a few months ago.

My sister thinks basically it is fishy and the should have put him on a medicine to make it better, she is an RN, and thinks it is fishy he is being sent to a memory center for day rehabilitation. 

Is this the normal process? He must have had a neurologist refer him there, right? 

Sorry. This was long. Please give any advice you can, it's hard even getting any information from my dad and I want to compare it to what his wife says.

Thank you!","I’m terribly sorry you are going through this.  It must be pretty difficult and then compounded by the fact that there are four sides to the story. It might be hard to get a definitive answer under the best of circumstances though. 

Early onset is typically for someone who is diagnosed around or before 60.  For your father’s age, there could be several things going on and one may or may not be Alzheimer’s.  It seems like your dad and his new wife are doing the best for him by going to the memory specialist.  Are you in the US?  The Alzheimer’s association is a great resource to help you find local services and professionals that could assist you guys.  There are some medications that could help ease symptoms and maybe even stall the progression of some of the stages.  Is there a geriatric physician in your area you could set him up with an appointment?  The Alzheimer’s association would have a list of doctors to see to get things started for a correct diagnosis.
It’s worth asking if any meds were recommended or who referred him to treatment. But it’s not uncommon to go to therapy or to get a POA. If your sister doesn’t trust her, I get it. But I guarantee the wife sees and experiences things your sister doesn’t. I can talk to my dad and sometimes he’s ok. Others, he has forgotten my mom’s name. She sees it every day and night. I only catch a glimpse. So your sister and you may not recognize the extent of his trouble. And as loving people go, I can attest that they tend not to share all the details to those who may be wounded most by them. So, this doesn’t seem uncommon to me. Maybe your sister needs to go spend a lot of time with him firsthand.
This behavior sounds very much so like my father's noticeable symptoms during his onset of alzheimers. Getting you father into memory rehab is a helpful, productive thing to do to slow mental decline. For your sister's concerns, I get it, but it sounds like your dad's wife is really doing the best she can to help him.
There is nothing early about an onset of dementia at age 75.  That's the first thing.

It's actually a good thing that he has had some memory assessments.  If he is found to have some early-stage dementia, then going to a day-treatment center is appropriate.  

Oh I just noticed what may be a confusion between early onset, and early stage.  Early onset refers to beginning dementia at age 65 or earlier.  Early stage means the very earliest signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's, at any age - forgetfulness, misplacing things, etc.  (the other stages are Middle stage and Late stage).

I think your sister is overly suspicious.  I'm not seeing anything fishy in this picture.  I hope your father is no longer driving?",2022-02-18 12:41:43,upsidebrowfrown,svnrur
Alzheimers,Latest excuse,"The reasons for grandma not going to bed are getting longer. Tonight she says - sat in her chair, in front of the TV, in the living room - that she’s already in bed. 
Wonder if she’s going the same way as my other grandma and slipping into full on dementia.","Yeh, my mum (mid-stages alzhms) often says same, when she's fallen asleep in chair in front of the tv & I wake her up to go to bed, says ""but I'm already IN BED"".  I think, usually, she's been dreaming, & therefore, assumes she's in bed.  Takes her a minute or so to wake up properly & when she looks around & sees where she is, she realises she isn't in bed & is usually a bit surprised - then it's ""no, I wasn't sleeping"" even if she was snoring with mouth open.  Maintains ""I don't fall asleep in front of tv"".   Bless....",2022-02-18 16:16:37,Bolehillbilly,svso9c
Alzheimers,My grandfather was diagnosed today,"He is 87. My family has had suspicious based on his behavior in the past couple months, but now that it's official, I am devastated. He overheard the doctor tell my grandmother and when they got in the car, he told her that his ""life is basically over."" That shatters my fucking heart.

He finished cancer treatment in February of last year and was basically on the brink of death due to the huge toll it put on his body, he was put on hospice and we all had pretty much realized and accepted what was going to happen. But he miraculously pulled out of it and everything was going well again until now.

Has anyone had a family member diagnosed around this age? How quickly did their condition deteriorate? I'm terrified and don't know what to expect at this point.

Thank you all in advance","It typically progresses very slowly when diagnosed at this age. He will likely never see advanced dementia. Falls, other illnesses, and hospitalizations can cause the disease to advance so try to avoid those things as best you can. His life is not over at this point. There will be ups and downs including some times where you might think there's nothing wrong with him at all. Hopefully he'll forget what he heard. Don't remind him.
Some in the medical field that most people over the age of 85 or 90 or 95 have basically some dementia.  Even those that don't, slow down mentally.  

It's impossible to know how rapidly your grandfather's dementia will progress.  Protective factors are healthy diet, plenty of regular exercise, and social support and contact.

My feeling is that anyone that gets to that age should be grateful for a long life and just enjoy what time they have left.
Oh, so sorry, that's sad.   Could be slow, could be fast - never know how it's going to go until it happens.   But you can still enjoy time with yr grandpa, help him enjoy activities n stuff.  Look at alzheimers .org & dementia .org, other resources & pages like those, to educate yourself about it, & to find appropriate activities to enjoy with him that he'll be able to manage understanding, & enjoying.

Alzheimers,Experience with Early Onset Testing,"My dad has early onset Alzheimer’s. I have toyed with the idea of getting tested for the genes linked to it. There are 3 genes linked to it and from what I’ve read, it is almost guaranteed that you will get early onset. I’m not sure if getting tested will give me relief or change my life and how I live it. Or maybe I’ll start taking medication for it at a younger age. Can anyone share their experience on whether or not they’ve decided to get tested for the EARLY ONSET genes?

*I wanted to stress that I’m talking about early onset because with the other genes related to late set Alzheimer’s, the chances of getting the disease, even if you have the genes, are significantly lower than in the case with early onset. Also, obviously, with early onset, at least for me, it seems more terrifying since it typically cuts your years more than late onset. I know nothing is guaranteed and that cures could come and yada yada.","My wife was diagnosed at 49 with EOAD. We did the genetic testing on her to find out if she had the variants that may have been passed down to our sons.  She does not, so it’s not especially of concern for our kids.  However, it’s made all of us more aware of how diet and exercise can impact health.  We’ve all adopted a Best Practices approach with generally a Mediterranean diet and regular exercise.  Many studies have shown that this is a big benefit against many diseases that are common especially heart disease and diabetes.
I got tested. Neither my mom, grandma, or i have the genes yet both my mom and grandma got EOAD. From what I was told, the genetic links aren't a 100% guarantee in either direction, and that, like another poster said, diet and exercise go a really long way into preventing the disease. They also stressed that mental health treatment is important to treat and monitor for prevention. 

Edit: I did get tested though so that I could make an informed decision about having children. Otherwise, I do keep up with physical and mental health as though I do have those genes cause we still don't know so much about the disease and it makes me a better, healthier person anyway
Our family carries the PSEN1 mutation. My mother and brother were both diagnosed at 44. I am 46 & haven’t been tested - I won hundred percent thought that I would until it happened to me - it’s a death sentence. The only way I would’ve gotten tested is if I was going to have a child (luckily I have a stepson instead). If you test positive with one of these mutations- it is a 100% guarantee that you will have it. 

Hopefully…. after Reading your post you said that your dad had Early Onset- which isn’t eFAD. early Onset is rare - eFAD is happens to so few people- I will probably never meet another carrier in my lifetime. 
And they usually won’t test you unless you have a family member that comes out positive for one of the three genes. if that is the case private message me and I can also get you into a Facebook group/ It’s amazing for so many years I felt alone & And then I found people that actually knew what I was going through.",2022-02-17 12:15:10,lady873919,sutxw4

I know none of my family have dementia or Alzheimer but I am scare by the fact it could be there.

I know physical exercise and dieting can lessen the chances but what other stuff could help? Reading the sun has gotten more worried about my mother health, she very important for me!

But he knows me.He can't say or remember my name, but last year he could point at me and say ""that's the guy"" and he knew he could trust and rely on me for when he got confused and unsure.

  
*It's okay it was all part of his word substitution and finding other words and phrases for what he couldn't remember the exact word for.*

  
It's hard, but it's good to know that ***he knew*** I was there for him.

When, I have a respite caregiver or nurse come in they tell me that he follows me with his eyes and waits for my coming back into the room.   That they can't feed him and he accepts food from me far better than what they can do. He knows my voice and trusts me.  
*My father knows me*... nowadays, he might not be able to say words but he can still listen and he has a level of comprehension so that I can see it in his eyes as well as his giving proper responses (verbal affirmations) to specific questions he doesn't have to think too hard about.

It's hard,  but I'm going to look back at this with pride and me and him have had talks and I know he's there thinking about things .. I can see it in his eyes and his actions in his he tightens his grip on my hand.

Alzheimers,"Credit ruined due to Dementia, Anyone here face a similar issue?","Hi. This regards a man with Dementia but I thought it was close enough to hopefully relate to someone's experiences here. 

Background: I am the caretaker of my friend C, a 78 year old man with Dementia. I am very close with and work alongside his bio son who is power of attorney and between us, we handle C's life for him. 

About two years ago we went through all of C's credit cards and shut them down, or so we thought.  There were about two cards that we did not know existed and subsequently missed paying them off and shutting them down. The initial charges were small, about $100, but the late fees really piled on.

These cards over the past two years have substantially destroyed C's credit. We are worried that this destroyed credit will ruin his availability to get in to a nursing home of his choosing, which is a scenario that is approaching quickly. Do we have any availability to challenge these credit damages, on the grounds that C's Dementia has taken away his comprehension? How does this work? Do we have any options to get back his previously stellar credit score?","You can call the banks, explain the situation, notify the credit agencies.  Use one of C’s cards to pay his bills and pay it on time.
Who has Power of Attorney?
You could try asking in r/financialplanning. I've seen some banking and credit card employees answer questions there. Sometimes banks for example have extra protections for elderly. 

You could possibly try seeing if there is an AARP or Alzheimer's association near you that has advice to share.

Alzheimers,I am alone in this.,"My mother is 69 and lives a sedentary lifestyle. She decided to divorce my father at 57 and move to Vegas way far away from anyone else. I now struggle at the age of 24 to balance my mental health between work, relationships, and so on and so forth. I am the only child and have been given the godly position to watch after her. Shes been driving erratically for a couple years now, asks me the same exact question later on in the day, and generally is declining in tactful social skills and any initiative. I don't think I'm ready to be her sole caregiver at 24 and just want to live my life now. What can I do? Should I change my attitude? My location and just get outta there? I have this pension to be just free and live but I also care about my mother's well being. Why must this seem like a rock and a hard place?","At 24 there's no way you're capable of this sole responsibility. Is their money for somebody to come in to help a few days a week?

Check for resources in your area. In our county, the Area Agency on Aging. They specialize in these situations. Your local government hopefully will have a department or agency that can help.
Probably thinking we’re alone when we’re really not is one of the biggest realizations when helping parents with Alzheimer’s. You’re not alone and there are lots and lots of options for you. Posting this is just the first step.

Once the diagnosis is made there is no effective treatment and so symptomatic monitoring and  responding to the victims needs is the priority.
As others have said there isn't any benefit to knowing the detailed physical state of the brain since there is nothing that can be done with that information.

Alzheimers,Demanding we bring her home,"Hi all, my (34F) mother-in-law (89F) got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s just after I met her, about 5 years ago. She’s been living in her home with my boyfriend and I, and while the whole experience has been frustrating (feeding the dog 6x per day until she throws up, feeding the dog human food, throwing away food we just bought, buying tons of batteries/cottage cheese/cabbage, anything left on a surface “put away” never to be seen again, shadowing and sun downing, etc) we’ve been rolling with the punches.

Last December she had hip surgery and had to sleep in the study on the ground floor. We thought maybe this would turn into a permanent stage, but beginning with the first night she was home it was catastrophic. The exit alarm we put under her mattress seemed to go off twice an hour. We had blocked the stairs to the second floor with chairs and signs, but she fought us to get to the chairs, bit her son, called us a bitch and bastard and that she would never, ever forgive us for this. Every morning she was back to her sweet self.

Fast forward to two weeks ago and she was exercising in the kitchen with her home health worker (they are in the house while we have to work from roughly 11am-3pm) when we think she stood up too quickly and fainted. She fell and hit her head and broke her humerus just below the shoulder joint. Spent 3 days in the trauma center of the local hospital before being discharged to a rehab center. She’s doing better with the pain (not sure if healing or they’re just doing a good job staying on top of it with the meds) but mentally and emotionally it’s been horrific. We tried to visit as much as possible during the first two weeks, but she is fixated on the thought that we are doing this to her and we want her out of our lives. She doesn’t even know her arm is broken and it’s impossible to have any kind of rationale discussion with her because facts are only valid for a few fleeting moments at a time.

All of this is complicated by the fact that when she was younger, she uprooted her own mother (who had dementia but no Alzheimer’s) from her home and brought her to live with them, but then had her children drug her ice cream and drop her off at a senior living center when it became too much. She keeps saying “I would never do this to my own parent, I would never do this to someone I love.” I can’t tell if she’s feeling guilty or honestly believes that.

She has a doctor’s appointment this afternoon and I’m kind of dreading either outcome— staying at the rehab center or being discharged home. I know I will have some more specific questions depending on what happens, but for now I think I just needed to vent.","I'm sorry you're going through this.  It sounds like much of her behavior is just the AD overcoming her mind.  If I had to guess, I'd think it's unlikely that she's still carrying any guilting memories of what happened to her own mother.  Like she says she'd never put someone she loves in a nursing facility, I'm guessing a more rational version of her would've also never fought, bit, or name-called someone she loves.  She just sounds like the angry, vindictive type and you and your boyfriend are easy targets.   Despite her foggy wishes and demands, is there a particular reason that your partner and their family are choosing to not place her in a permanent residential care facility?  It sounds like you all would be better served with that kind of arrangement.  It'd probably be a hard transition for her -- probably any transition is difficult for someone of that age -- but the dust would settle at some point.
It’s so hard. In the beginning of my Mom’s diagnosis she fed her cats constantly and wouldn’t leave the house because the cats needed to be fed. She had 13 cats (5 kittens in that total) and she still kept stealing the neighbor’s cats and keeping them in her home. Later  we moved her to a Alzheimer’s facility. Ultimately you have to do what you need to do to keep her safe. Safety comes first. If she wanders or tries hurting herself, you need to put her somewhere safe. Don’t let guilt trap you into making decisions based on emotion instead of what is safe and necessary. I will be praying for your family. It is so difficult.
The descent into dementia is confusing and exhausting for everyone. Does her son have power of attorney for health decision making? If not, that would be the first order of business. Then discuss her care needs and fears with her doctor - who I hope is a gerontologist or neurologist with expertise in Alzheimer's disease. Also include the health needs of you and your boyfriend. While she may benefit from medication for sleep and anxiety there are downsides to medicating the elderly. She now needs 24 hour care. Her family should make decisions about her care needs with everyone in mind - no guilt.",2022-02-16 09:57:18,Typical-Math75,stxv6v
Alzheimers,Is anyone familiar with Corticobasal Degeneration?,"My dad was ‘misdiagnosed’ with AD in Feb 2019 at age 57.  He started showing symptoms in his 40s. Summer of 2020 he was then diagnosed with CBD which is a progressive disease that affects movement, speech, and memory. For him, its short term memory. he could tell you everything about his childhood, college years, anything up until maybe 5 years ago but doesnt remember falling last weekend. Hes losing his ability to talk and think of words. When hes trying to think of a word, he’ll explain it but then forget the original story. God it hurts. I cannot think of anything more painful than seeing your smart, funny, intelligent, and hardworking dad become a different person. 

I suppose im just wondering if any redditors out there are familiar with it!","[deleted]
I'm very sorry for your father's diagnosis.  I wish there was any good things to say about it 🙁.

CBD is a very rare movement disorder that should only be diagnosed by movement disorder specialists.  It's primary symptoms are movement related and most people have a progressively worsening limb (typically one of the hands) which over time become extremely difficult to use, increasingly more stiff, and twisted with dystonic postures.  There is also severe changes in abilities to walk with frequent falling early in the disease and significant parkinsonism except typically there is no tremor. 

 There is also an alien limb phenomenon that is a seen sometimes where your arm moves around and does things without any control. There are also significant changes in speech with very slurred words and a softer voice.  The word finding troubles you described are common in all types of neurocognitive disorders.

It is an aggressive and terrible disease and the average lifespan is four to seven years with the last years being very cumbersome.  If this was not diagnosed by a movement disorder specialist That's well versed in CBD, I highly recommend another opinion with a movement disorder specialist.  I have seen misdiagnoses with CBD and in progressive supranuclear palsy from general neurologists and neuropsychologists a few times and it is important to make sure that the diagnosis is correct.  

Most people suspected of CBD are tried on high doses of carbidopa levodopa to see if any response can be appreciated.

It is hard to imagine a neurologist misdiagnosing CBD with Alzheimer's.  They are very different diseases that progress in very different ways.  Memory loss is typically a part of CBD but it is not the major factor in diagnosing it.  People are often misdiagnosed with Parkinson's disease before it is changed to CBD.

Your mentioning of symptoms in his forties is also alarming because CBD rarely occurs in the 40s and if it did they sadly would not live to 57.  The same is true for most major neurodegenerative diseases that hit in an early stage.  FTD, ALS, MSA, early onset AD, DLB, and so on have short lifespans of around 2 to 7 years.

If a movement disorder specialist did not diagnose him I very much recommend getting that opinion just to make sure that this isn't something else.  I'm very sorry again for this diagnosis.  I wish you and your father the best and will keep you in my thoughts.",2022-02-15 14:17:54,smryan08,stauhn
Alzheimers,Diagnosing Alzheimers,"I need to ask here because my sister and I have exhausted all other options. My father passed away 2 years ago (63 aneurisms) My mother 73 has moved from her home (Africa) to split living with me and my family (Europe) and my sister in the UK.  She had been saying her memory was bad and my dad had been saying it for a few years before he died. Now she is living with us it is clear how bad her memory is. She is in very good physical health does not drink or smoke. 

Her memory of anything recent is non-existent. She claims it was brought on by trauma from my fathers passing, but it's not that. She is very educated and use to read about 3 books a week. Now she doesn't. She cant remember anything she forgets to eat lunch and brush her teeth. 

We have had her seen by a phycologist who put her on a mild antidepressant - no change 

She had an MRI scan - All Clear 

She had her blood tested - All clear 

She was asked questions by a specialist but she answered them fine. She knows things like who the Priminister is and how to spell words backwards. 

What do we do now? It comes to a point where she is not able to be left on her own as she can't remember which garbage goes in which recycle bin etc.

We saw a psychiatrist who sent us for PET and SPEC scans of the brain. One measures the consumption of glucose in the brain, the other consumption of oxygen. Both showed a deterioration in the brain of my wife. This was consistent with the failing memory.

Alzheimers,I'm just not sure what to do at this point...,"My dad has been having memory problems for 2+ years and slowly declining. I've been assuming it's alzheimers and mentally preparing but he lives in a different state than me and I can only do so much between visits. He recently stopped attending our weekly video/phone chats (a month ago) and I've been trying to call/text/email/any contact him for a week now with no response from him. 

Some context:

The only person in his town he has any contact with is his ex-wife, who tells me she still drops by or at least hears from him at least once a week. He's doing 'okay' (i.e. no safety concerns but lots of other concerns). He often doesn't pick up the phone because he doesn't hear it or thinks he's 'busy' and doesn't want to be bothered. He used to consider me his 'favorite' and would only talk to me if he wouldn't pick up for others, but now no contact at all from him.

My brother and I are both on a durable POA for him. We both live several states away. No other family to help besides ex-wife. He's more and more paranoid and is quite distrustful of strangers these days.

He kinda hoards and doesn't clean his house and has ferrets he takes care of. I'm starting to get worried about the animals if he is not talking to me anymore; clearly something about his routine changed.

Before he stopped talking to me he had been telling me stories about seeing people in his house (which he couldn't describe), thinking they could take care of his pets and then realizing they weren't real, thinking they were kicking him out of his house so he got locked out one night and couldn't remember how he got back in, etc. He has gotten lost more often on his walks (he has basically chosen to stop driving due to eyesight, thank god). He misplaces items all the time and buys new versions so his house has massive quantities of basically everything. So it seems he was getting bad and now he's probably worse.

I just found out THIS WEEKEND from his doctor that he missed his last neurology appointment a month ago and that LAST APRIL the doctor has diagnosed him with 'probable alzheimers.' This whole last year we had no diagnosis to try to do anything with; now it feels we are suuuuper running out of time. His ex-wife has offered to go to an appt with him but if he won't pick up the phone (and he often doesn't answer the door for her even when expecting her) how do we even get him there?

He lives in Albuquerque, NM--a city with limited resources and a police force known to abuse citizens, especially those with mental health problems. So I refuse to call the police for a wellness check. However, he has a gun in his house (no idea if he even remembers he has one) so all concerned are not willing to be forceful when they try to drop by or check on him and he's not answering the door.

He has always been ridiculously stubborn nothing is wrong. He has said before, when he was a bit more lucid and we were talking, that if something was wrong with him he wouldn't want to know about it anyway. I think he realizes he's getting worse and trying to distance himself from people, but I feel soooo responsible because I have POA and he's my freaking dad.

I'm feeling very stuck and helpless and I don't have a lot of time/resources to be traveling back and forth between multiples states (especially when he won't pick up or even answer his door). I either need somebody to give me ideas on what I can try to do or somebody to tell me what a reasonable mental limit is on the responsibility I place on myself. This whole thing is the worst.","I'm afraid a trip down there is really needed.  You can't delegate it to an ex-wife and from what you, police either.  Nobody knows if your father is even alive!  

You should try to convince him to come live with either you or your brother.  Please note that this is a temporary status, though you might not want to tell him that.  His old age could be quite pleasant in one of the better assisted living or memory care facilities.  What is his net worth?  Even if he has to go  the medicaid route, not all of those are so horrible.

Good luck.  Please don't delay very long.

We'll sell autos first, have an auction on any items my sister and I don't want for ourselves, and then sell the house. After that, we'll use his retirement savings to pay for his care until he passes.  


I hope that helps. Big hugs.
Guardianship is a very involved and expensive process that involves going through the courts. It is not automatic even with a dementia diagnosis. The smoothest course of action possible is for FIL to willingly sign a durable POA (with a notary) granting powers to his daughter. Don’t try to use the dementia to convince him, because it may make him paranoid. Emphasize that it’s important in case he gets hit by a truck one day and his daughter needs the ability to sort out medical paperwork and pay his bills on his behalf, and always for his best interest.
It is important to get a financial and a medical POAs (two different forms). They can be found free on the internet. Our local bank notarized ours for free. Quite a few financial and medical institutions will not accept generic POA forms and you will have to use their company specific forms. (Vanguard and Kaiser for example).

My wife didn't want to sign the forms either. What I did was print out all the forms for both of us with the wording slightly different on our respective forms. Set up an appointment with the  notary, bought our adult kids and family friends and extra legal documents to sign like wills, etc. Told her we were planning for every possible future scenario if something happened to me or her or both of us. Then started her off with signing my forms, which she was happy to do. After initialing and signing for a few minutes she stopped caring about what the forms said. The notary didn't care or probably read the room.

Our family lawyer had a backup plan if this didn't work, but getting the forms signed this way was free. It did involve a lot more time and leg work on my part, than I expected, to get everything squared away.
Unless I'm missing something, a person with dementia wouldn't lose legal control over their bank accounts and assets until they actually die.  Of course, this then presents a very messy situation.  At some point ...soon... FIL needs to come to terms with his prognosis and make responsible decisions while he still can.  He needs to appoint an POA.  Again, unless I'm missing something, he could definitely appoint his wife as his POA, and then she can appoint contingent POA(s) in the event she's not capable of doing what needs to be done.  My parents just went through this a couple years ago, while my Mom was still of some sound mind.  She authorized the appointment of my Dad as her POA, and then my Dad lined up my brother and I as contingent POAs for her and POAs for him.  As her POA, he also took her name off all their marital assets, so that when she is placed in residential care -- which'll probably be sometime this year -- he won't be left out in the cold and homeless trying to pay for it because she'll be on Medicaid and have effectively no assets that can be reclaimed by the government.

You and your wife would be very, very wise to consult with a local attorney that specializes in these kinds of matters.  If you're not aware of any, contact your local chapter of an Alzheimer's not-for-profit -- they'll have a list of resources available.
My mother recieved legal control of everything within a few months of his diagnosis.
I recently had my health care power of attorney (POA) activated as spouse of an Alzheimer's patient.  He was acting kind of loco and his psychiatrist and a second doctor, on hearing his behavior as well as consulting with each other, signed off on it.  

Years ago, my husband and I got an estate plan that included both durable powers of attorney (has to do with legal and business authority) and health care POA.  Since this predated his dementia diagnosis by several years, it is unlikely to be challenged.  He wouldn't be able to  challenge it himself, certainly, as he can barely dial a phone, remember the day of the week or current month or year.  Fortunately, we're working well together.

If I have any advice, it is to try to convince you FIL and MIL to make an estate plan, before he is diagnosed.  The estate plan includes wills, but also assigns durable POA, health care POA, living will if desired, and related documents.  Depending on their wealth level, a health care trust might be a good idea, which the attorney can advise about.  Please note that approaching it this way means you don't have to imply that FIL is losing his wits; it's just a good idea as one ages.  My spouse and I also started our burial planning, bought a cemetery plot and set up and prepaid his funeral (I'm considerably younger so deferred my funeral).
My grandmother was diagnosed with dementia, and my piece of shit fucking cunt of an uncle pretended he wanted to be her primary carer. Once he got that title and moved into their house, he made life hell for my grandfather, and lied to my grandmother about him, turning them against each other. Eventually it got so bad that my grandfather had to move out and live with us (in another part of the country) while my uncle took advantage of my grandmother. He never let any of us see her, took all of her money, forced her to sell their house they had had for years, and generally made the last few years of her life hell. I know this most likely isn't relevant to you, but please please make sure legally something like this cannot happen.",2022-02-15 09:34:37,,st4alc

Alzheimers,"Well, now I just wait, I suppose.","Just got done with the blood draw. My neurologist ordered a genetic test done for all the known alz and dementia variants since my late grandfather had alz hit early, my father is worried he has it, and there’s concern for it to potentially be the fun and rare familiar kind of alz. Doc was glad to do it, especially since I’m only in my 30s and the earlier we know, the more we can try as meds as research improve.

I’d rather know the risk than not, it’ll make planning for the future while both alive and dead easier, and I view it as a higher quality of life since I wouldn’t miss any of the moments I want to experience before anything should happen, but damn. The weight of it all hit after the blood left my body. 

I don’t know really what I’m looking for by posting, if I’m honest. I’ve done the research, my doc is great, I’ve got genetic counseling, I’ve experienced the decline and fall of alz in my own family, and I know nothing is guaranteed even if I do light up the dementia panel like a redneck christmas tree. I guess it just feels like y’all would understand more than others and sounding off into that kind of ether felt right.

Anyway. Now I just wait. And probably worry, despite all the reasons not to.","Best of luck with your results. You are young, and research is ongoing, so I'm ever hopeful for better treatments or even a cure.
There are steps that some research suggests delays the onset of Alzheimer's: maintain physical and mental fitness, avoid destructive habits: smoking, drug use, alcohol, and get regular, high quality sleep.
Sending all the positive vibes for good results. 

Can you tell me if there is any risk or harm doing this as far as insurance coverage goes in the future? My husband is considered high risk genetically and his mom's doctor has already given him advice in how to possibly avoid it.
What do you mean by the phrase 'decline and fall' ? Aren't they the same thing?  


Also, brave for doing it.   


I personally do not want to know.   


I'll do my best to live healthily but i do not want to be waiting for that condition to arrive in 30 / 40 years time, like a fedex parcel from hell. No thank you
And remember, even if you are at risk (I have a copy of the major risk variant APOE4 as well as some more minor Alz risk genes, my mom was diagnosed at 72), there’s still a lot you can do to reduce your risk and there are several decades of preventative advances (like the Alzheimer’s “vaccine”) ahead of us yet!
Fingers crossed for you. My dad JUST had genetic testing done (he has Corticobasal Degeneration) and he doesnt have anything to pass to us-wishing you the same♥️
This is a very brave thing for you to do.
good luck
I am trying to figure out what to do as far as if I should get the test.

Alzheimers,My Mom is in Hospice Care,"My Mom has had Alzheimer’s for the past eight years. She will pass with the help of Hospice in the next few days. Even though I knew this day was coming, I feel so unprepared and hurt so much. I don’t want her to suffer anymore, though. She is in another state. I am trying to decide whether to fly and be with her or say goodbye on the phone because she won’t be aware with the drugs she will be on. I kind of want to remember her as she was our last visit. Is this disloyal to not want to be there. She has my three brothers. I don’t know what the right thing to do is. Please give me advice.","I believe, on the whole, the right answer is to be there.  Not only will you probably eventually come to regret having not been there, but it could make things awkward/difficult/tense between you and your family members that are there.  I totally understand what you're saying and what you're feeling, but I think in the end it'd be better for you and your family for you to be there.  Perhaps your focus could be more about supporting your family who's there, rather than necessarily seeing Mom in that condition and saying goodbye.
I would go and be with her.  I just lost my mom 2 days ago.  Myself and 1 brother were on FaceTime with her when she actually passed.  She lived with a different brother, who I don’t really have a good relationship with.   I had made plans to fly there tomorrow to be with her before she passed but now I don’t need to go.  Do you have good relationships with your brothers?  If yes, I say definitely go. DM me if you want.
I would 100% try to be there. Hearing is supposedly the last, or one of the last senses to go. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-musical-self/202008/is-hearing-the-last-go

So if you guys could be around and talk a bit to her, maybe it could be at least some comforting or emotionally familiar sounds, even if comprehension isnt there. I don't think there's any proof of this, but to me, I'd try. 

I was there when my dad went, and it was hard but I would much rather have been there than not.
My grandfather recently passed away after about 4 months on home hospice.  It had been a long time coming and we probably waited too late to call an hospice agency.  (I cannot say enough nice things about the work of hospice nurses - they made the situation bearable.)  My uncle and I did the majority of the day to day tasks since my grandmother was no longer able and it was a very long heart wrenching 4 months, but I would do it again if I had to.  Personally, I will say that I don't view family members that could have helped or shown up and didn't in the same way that I did before.  Being there can be very hard but you're there just as much for the people that will remain.
I need to add: we sat with our dad as he died in June, palliative care. It wasn't peaceful even though he was unconscious. It was really really hard and I'm not sure I will ever get those final images out of my head. That wasn't my dad, my dad was full of life and laughter. 

That's just my experience though.
Follow your heart.  

Our mom has Alzheimer's, too, and lives in an assisted living facility in another state, so am able to understand how difficult this is for you.
Whatever you decide is a valid choice. I'm only commenting to tell you that once the dying fase is over, you'll start to get much more memories back of how she used to be, before she got so sick. It was a welcome relief for me, and the mourning towards her death is absolutely so much harder than knowing it's over.
I just lost my dad. If you can, or think you want to, just go.So much of him was gone already, but I was able to hold his hand for a little while. There's no perfect way to go about this, and I spent so much time trying to make the right decisions.Now I just miss him.
My wife is starting to enter the final stages of FTD. I/we have raced across the country for both parents’ and an inlaw’s final days. While I probably would have felt regret not making the attempt for the first one, I definitely had serious regret racing to get there and then waiting ten days for the third one to pass. I agree, your mother is going to be so far out of it, she is not going to register that you are there. No one, who has been through this, will judge you for not going. I think you need to worry more about how you will handle and your relationships with your brothers not being there. If it was me, I would FaceTime with mom and pay for your family to go out to dinner while waiting for her to pass (or cover some other expense).
This is such a hard decision to make, and so very personal.  Do you think that you will be sorry that you didn't see her one last time?  I am dealing with the same thing right now; Dad is in transition.  I jump at every phone call, because he will be gone this week.  I saw him last night, and will go there tomorrow after work if he is still holding on.  I was glad to hold his hands and kiss his brow, even though he doesn't know anymore that I am there.  Of course, being out of state, I know this is a harder decision for you.  You are not being disloyal.  You need to do what feels right for you.  Much love - I know how hard this is.
Go be with your mum..
Hey. Its so completely normal to not want to be there. But, i would try and be there. Personally, i think i would regret not going, but i dont think i would ever regret going.  But its your decision and you know yourself. I cannot even begin to think of this. But I’m always preparing. Wishing you peace♥️
It is not disloyal. It is better to have those good memories and not her actual death. 

I'm sorry. It's all just so hard.
Update:  I have a flight booked for Friday. I had some other things happening that complicated my leaving earlier. I like the way I left things during my last visit, but if I can be a comfort to her and my family, I will be there. Thank you all for the advice.  This was a difficult decision but it helped so much to hear what other people who are  experiencing similar things had to say. I’m thankful for this community. ❤️🙏",2022-02-14 13:57:26,jokesterjen,ssi99w

Alzheimers,Weird thing I noticed,Everyone I’ve met with Alzheimer’s was kind of a sour puss before they were diagnosed.  With my grandpa he saw his father die as a young child and never talked about it. He still knows it happened but doesn’t want to talk about it ever. With my uncle who has passed he always acted smarter than everyone in his life and almost looked down on a lot of his family for never leaving their small town. So a theory I have about Alzheimer’s is that it forms from not being honest with yourself and keeping feelings trapped inside for so long the materialize as the brain disease we know as Alzheimer’s. I am starting to notice little things with my mom now (who was touched as a child and hates to talk about it). I am wondering if any of you have had problems with someone who has had a “good” life because everyone I know with it has been blocking things from their consciousness for a long time which leads me to believe that has something to do with it forming. I’m going to start going to therapy so this doesn’t happen to me.,"My dad was happy and a jokester. Now he barely cracks a smile.
My grandmother was an absolute saint. She still developed Alzheimer’s.  I’m relatively certain that she delayed onset by being big into exercise, which was weird for her generation. 

She was always there for everyone; when she got the diagnosis we were all devastated.  It was very difficult to see her deteriorate because she was such a lovely woman.

My mother just got diagnosed.  It’s about a decade earlier than her mother did but my mother has been poor at looking after herself for most of my life. She didn’t start out that way, events as an adult broke her mind before I was even born. She became the poster child for not taking responsibility for anything. She’s a bundle of toxic behaviour. She’s a hoarder already, we got her credit cards taken away more than a decade ago now because of her spending habits and she always had a shitty memory and poor impulse control.  We’ve got a theory about that too but at this point it doesn’t really matter. 

I’m hoping the downhill slide will be quick.  We’re all pretty exhausted from looking after her for so long.
My wife had a stable upbringing and is the sweetest, kindest person I know. On the other hand I was beaten for the smallest reason until I was fourteen and drew back a fist. You need to read a little more about this disease.
By all means go to therapy. But there are many wonderful and loving people who have ended up with dementia. It would be nice to think they somehow deserved it or we could somehow keep it from happening to us, but so far that's not possible.

No. Having bad experiences does not cause Alzheimer's. Take my parents for example. Dad had a stable life getting up. No abuse, supportive family. Not wealthy but stable. He got Alzheimer's.

My mom was physically and mentally abused from a young age. Moved to various homes with relatives. Experienced many traumas and has many repressed memories that randomly pop up. She's fine.

Sure it's good to be in great mental health but it won't prevent Alzheimer's.
No and I think this is quite a hurtful post tbh. Good luck in therapy
My mother's been nice all of her life and helping whoever she could. Her only problem was that she rarely stood up for herself.

Even though a lot of people don't agree with you, it is good to look at things from multiple perspectives and try to understand it. Keep on trying, we can find a cure for this together.",2022-02-13 13:23:48,Zestyclose_Ask_8563,srp82k
Alzheimers,Does this sound like dementia?,"My mother is 64. My family is increasingly concerned about dementia. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 30+ years ago which was fairly well controlled with lithium for decades until the lithium damaged her kidneys (she was taken off at the end of 2017). She now takes seroquel, topomax, and clonazepam, as well as blood pressure medication.

We have noticed more memory and cognitive issues in the last year or so. For example:
- difficulty following storylines in shows and movies
- frequently misplacing items and believing unknown others are taking them or messing with her
- repeatedly asking the same questions or telling the same information
- when filling out a medical form, she stared blankly for a while before finally leaning over and asking me what the year is
- difficulty grasping sequences of events or multistep processes
- difficulty using her iPhone
- multiple, repeated small car accidents that culminated in an accident that totaled her car in October 2021 (fortunately she is no longer driving and no one was hurt)

These cognitive issues seem to wax and wane and sometimes are more apparent than others. But generally she does not seem to be where she was a year or two ago. 

More debilitating is the nightly terror and paranoia that really sets in in the evening. She is unable to stay alone. Her first episode with paranoia that required mental health hospitalization was in September 2020. That paranoia waned a bit but since the spring of 2021 it has been plaguing her almost every night. She has done much better during the day, but she does get anxiety in anticipation of the evening. We have home health aides coming in to stay with her at night but we are pursing assisted living. 

She can dress herself, shower, go to the bathroom, and even cooks sometimes but seems to be incapable of “running her life.” She is not eating well. Her house gets dirty.
She is currently in the hospital for the second time in three weeks. She took Ubers there both times concerned about herself having a stroke but both times they ran tests and determined that she did not have a stroke. They weighed her and she weighed just 105 lbs and she is 5’9” tall. (They have had her there since Wednesday this time and after explaining to the physical therapist all that is going on, they are recommending skilled nursing for a couple of weeks while we figure out next steps… we are awaiting insurance approval). 

It’s hard to tell if these are mental health issues or cognitive decline (or both). We are interested in having her evaluated for dementia or at least a new psychiatrist who has a fresh perspective on her mental health. Her current psychiatrist does not seem to be helping and just sort of shrugs his shoulders. She is open to seeing a new psychiatrist. We are not sure, if she does in fact have dementia, whether the medications she is prescribed are appropriate or exacerbating things. 

Does this sound like your loved ones’ progression and symptoms?","I noticed clonazepam is among the meds she takes.  I'm not a doctor, ok, but I'll share my experience with clonazepam.  I was prescribed it for restless legs at night.  I took it 3 or 4 years, and felt I was progressively getting stupider.  Foggy head, couldn't concentrate.  Come to find out, it has a half-life greater than 24 hours, meaning slowly and gradually, it was building up in my system.  I stopped taking it, of course!

Something to discuss with your mother's doctor - could the clonazepam, or other meds, be contributing to your mother's mental decline?

A complete assessment for dementia, of course, will rule out conditions which can mimic dementia, which includes depression, thyroid disease, and a vitamin deficiency.  I do not know how bipolar features in this story.

I suggest you have her evaluated by a neurologist, but don't tell her you are checking her out for Alzheimer's.  Tell her it's a med review to check for side effects, something like that.  Make sure the neurologist knows, in advance, the symptoms that concern you.

Good luck with your mother.

edited to add:  dementia is not typically diagnosed by a psychiatrist (though I am sure there are exceptions, such as a specialized geriatric psychiatrist).  More commonly, it's diagnosed by a neurologist or geriatric medicine specialist, and involves neuropsychological testing,  sometimes imaging, in addition to clinical presentation and family reports of symptoms.
Not with my MIL. She seemed absent when I first met her, undiagnosed. I'd say like on auto pilot. She was probably pretending to listen and relying on social cues to respond even then. We took her to get tested for dementia when she would ask what day it was. She had no initiative to look at a calendar.  Things got really bad when one day she asked if her husband was dead, grieved for the rest of the day and the following she'd regressed to before he'd died. She must have been hiding the full extent of her deficits for a long time. She was very old. We went through hell getting her proper help but she's got it now and still doing OK in memory care 2 years on. Nearly 100. 

The memory care facility we visit her at has a wide variety of people with psycho geriatric issues. It's possible your mum has paranoid schizophrenia or Lewy Body. It's also possible as you said that the drugs she's on are causing an anticholinergic reaction as happens in elderly people. Memory test is key.
I'd bring up your concerns to the hospital and have them bring in a neurologist and get a CAT or MRI to see if it is degenerative or not. Dementia is more a symptom rather than a disease itself and can be brought on by a multitude of issues - Alzheimers is just the most common. 

I'd also definitely get a different psychiatrist. My dads was completely useless as well. He finally called to tell how ""worried"" he was about my dads mental decline after I canceled an appointment for him. Strange how he wasn't worried all those months he kept taking my dads money and prescribing him pills when he could barely speak a proper sentence 🤔 (he had aphasia as one of his first symptoms).
That sounds more like Lewy Body Disease than Alzheimer's if you ask me. I knew someone who had LBD, and they had their cognitive fluctuations and psychosis just like you describe.",2022-02-13 11:00:06,Momofboog,srltn9
Alzheimers,Refusal to go to memory care,"Definitely needing some advice, my uncle was recently found wandering off, doctor says he has dementia, very middle stage. He is currently living with my parents and they have found a wonderful memory care facility for him. He refuses to go, and the facility says “they don’t have people for those that refuse”My Mom has a full power of attorney, what can they do?  He’s very argumentative, and verbally aggressive. My Mom has a heart condition and the emotional toll is already ruining my parents, but they don’t know what to do now.","Let me relate my experience.  We started my partner going to ""memory cafes"" before the pandemic, which were small groups with a facilitator that did crafts activities, snack, talking about their past, etc.  After the pandemic closed those down, he went for a day or two a week to an adult day care, where they had similar activities for most of the day, meals and snacks.  

He needed a minor surgery and I asked if the hospital could discharge him to a nursing home (Medicare pays 21 days if discharged after a 3+ day hospital stay).  He didn't want to go, but I compromised:  it wouldn't be permanent, just for a week or so.  He's in a memory care level nursing facility right now.

At each point, in this gradual progression, he enjoyed staff and other participants (fortunately, he's very social in temperament) and quickly made friends.  I have pointed out to him that he will make friends and find enjoyable things to do wherever he goes.  Plus, I have made sure he had a family or friend visitor every single day, and I phone often.

This was a gradual exposure to dementia care activities and facilities, and I kind of think when the time comes for a permanent placement, he'll do okay.

See if your memory care place will allow him to come (with you) for a luncheon a week plus maybe one group activity - or just observe the group activity.  If they will, he may find this isn't such a scary thing.  Find what attractive things they offer, such as a field trip to a local attraction like a museum or conservatory or outdoor concert.  If the facility's policies allow it, perhaps he can come out with you to a restaurant or movie occasionally, or family gathering.

I hope this is helpful, although I realize it won't work for everyone.  Good luck.
I would suggest having him at least tour, eat lunch, join an activity. See if that makes it more appealing. Maybe go several times. 

Also, this type of conversation is a process. It’s one you will have several times in different iterations. Ask him what his concerns and reservations are against going. Hear him out. Reassure him and let him know in a kind way that the family needs more help than they can get at home, that he deserves quality care. 

It’s hard, and it will be painful. The doctor may be able to help with some medication that may help with the aggression. 

Good luck. Dementia is cruel. Sorry your family is having a tough time.
Before I retired my mom, who has dementia, went to an adult day care center while I went to work. She had good meals, snacks, indoor and outdoor activities. The staff was wonderful, so loving and hands-on. I dropped her off and picked her up, even though the center provided transportation. Perhaps the facility your family is considering offers day care. Although I do question their refusing to accept your uncle based on his refusal to be admitted as that is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia and that’s what a memory care center does. However day care can be part of transitioning to a full time care center and it will give your parents the respite so need.
We took my dad for lunch at the facility a couple times. My boyfriend is a salesman and somehow got my dad to believe that it was his idea to move there. It's ok to lie in these cases.
What does ""they don't have people for those that refuse"" mean? Does that mean they won't physically restrain him if he tries to leave or that they won't accept someone who isn't consenting?

What I'm hearing works with some people is telling the person with dementia that their doctor wants them to stay at this place just for a little while to get better. But it also depends what his refusal consists of and how much pushback your parents are prepared to muster to it. I like u/UnsightlyFuzz's suggestion of short term exposures as well, assuming your uncle will go along with that.
In my country the judge needs to sign off on moving people to the closed dementia ward. It's a process, but you're not alone.

Alzheimers,wedding advice,"Hello,

My dad has pretty advanced Alzheimer's. He can remember our names and who we are but he is not the same person...you all know how it is. I recently got engaged and my partner and I are wrestling with the decision of whether to have a smaller ceremony sooner or go with our original plan next year September. Has anyone had any experience dealing with this? I just don't really know what to do...how will I feel if he progresses and isn't aware of who I am? Do I care about my wedding that much - it's just a day? But he wants to see us get married so...? So many questions. 

TLDR - dad has Alzheimer's, worried if I wait to get married he will forget who I am and miss it.","7 months is plenty of time for things to change quite a lot. And you don’t get warning when it does. A broken hip can accelerate the progression quite a lot, flooding in like a broken dam.

Does he actually enjoy large gatherings still? He may find them overwhelming and not enjoyable already. 

If it’s important for him to see you get married, dance and make a speech and take photos, and you think he still would enjoy it, I’d say a smaller ceremony sooner rather than later. You can have a large reception as originally planned later on as well
If I were you I would have a small ceremony sooner. It clearly matters to you that your dad is there with you on this day and he wants to see you get married. A wedding is just a day but the ability to share it with those we love makes it special. This is so tough, thinking of you OP and sending you love x
My sister got married when my grandfather was quite advanced with his dementia, but he still enjoyed himself and enjoyed the dancing. 

I'd say go with the smaller ceremony, because 7 months is a long time when it comes to dementia and down the line you never know if his medical needs would have changed.
I recommend this if you can do it. My mom was overwhelmed at her grandson's wedding and didn't want to sit still or stay in the room. She knew who he was, but the crowd was too much for her. Had we known how it would go, it would have been far better to privately do a ceremony, think of it as a practice session, at her home for her to watch in her comfort zone, and then they could do their actual wedding knowing they'd made her happy with the smaller practice run.
If he has advance Alzheimers, I don't think I would include him.  He will not remember and I feel like even a small ceremonty would be overwheelming.  Maybe, you can do a photo shoot with the two of you in your wedding dress as soon as you get it?  

My mom is in stage 5/6 and it would be too confusing for her to go to even a small gathering. Any more then two people and she get anxious.  I can not imagine if it was an evening wedding and her sundowners starts or there is a bathroom accident.  Not to mention who would be caring for her at the wedding.  

If your mom is his careprovider at the wedding, she wouldn't be able to enjoy/participate at the wedding.
You could always do a small pseudo ceremony for just him and a couple immediate family members and then have a full official wedding later. 

It really comes down to if it's important to you for him to experience you getting married. He isn't going to know any different.",2022-02-12 23:01:35,rainbowSweli,sr9l1g
Alzheimers,Sleep cycles,"Hi,

Just wondering what the sleep cycles are of your loving other with alzheimers?  Do they wake up when the sun rises or shortly after, and stay awake for the majority of the day?  

Reason being I have just read this post that the clearance of amyloid-beta plaques are linked to a healthy circadian rhythm sleep cycle.  In general my mother sleeps in quite a bit, and if we don't wake her up for breakfast or a shower she would naturally sleep until around 2pm in the afternoon.  On the odd occasion where she has to wake up very early for a doctors appointment, we would expect her to be overly tired, but she actually seems more alert.  I'm going to try to force early waking up with extra light, vitamin d, music, coffee etc in the hope to regain a normal sleep pattern and see what the effects on her alzheimers.

So just wondering what the sleep cycles are of everyone elses, parent, grandparent, spouse etc.  

[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220210154215.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220210154215.htm)","I think the answer you may get will vary with different people. My dad was always an early waker (around 6-7 am) but when he was late stage he would wake up around 10-11am mostly because  he spent most of the night sneaking downstairs to eat. He became a night owl whether he realized it or not.
Both my loved ones with Alz have always been early risers (sunrise) and up and active during the day. After dementia, and after becoming older and more sore overall, they both became less active, started going to bed earlier, and one of them started taking short naps during the day.",2022-02-12 17:26:33,BastionOfChaos,sr2yd2
Alzheimers,Short film: Elephant - A love story in defiance of an Alzheimer's diagnosis,,"Hi everyone,  
My wife, Vicky, made a very touching short film, ""Elephant"". It's about a jovial old man trying to process his Alzheimer's diagnosis while agonizing over how to protect his true love from heartbreak.  
Vicky spent many years volunteering in a senior care home and as she got to know the residents she learned of their struggles to maintain who they are, even when it felt hopeless.  
""Elephant"" won the Award of Distinction at Canada Shorts: Canadian and International Short Film Festival and is a love story getting released just in time for Valentine's Day :)  
I hope this movie can bring someone a bit of happiness and I wish you all a lovely weekend!
My dad (67 years old) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s this past September. My parents have been married for 46 years and my mom is struggling mightily with the diagnosis. As she’ll tell you, he’s been her world since she was 17 years old.
Such a beautiful short film about the power of love. Thank you for sharing - it reminds me a lot of my own parents.",2022-02-12 18:47:45,tyrahfu,sr4nk2
Alzheimers,Anyone use a MedReady medication dispenser?,"I am looking at something to manage Mom's medication routine better. She's done well with us sorting them into a standard daily sorter, and her taking them throughout the day. It's become obvious that she's struggling with the routine. I've been looking into devices and have found the MedReady MR-357 ([https://www.medreadyinc.net/products/medication-dispensers/monitored-medication-dispensers/medready-mr-357/](https://www.medreadyinc.net/products/medication-dispensers/monitored-medication-dispensers/medready-mr-357/)). I was wondering if anyone here has experience with this device (or a different model).

I primarily picked this one because for a few reasons. It offers the ability to plug it in, meaning that she will have to leave it where we put it and not take it to her chair, bed, or wherever the current sorter keeps appearing. It doesn't have to be tipped to remove pills; she drops the pills while dumping them now a lot, and she doesn't have finger mobility issues to have problems pulling them out instead. It has the option to sign up for a monitoring/emergency notification service now or down the road. The alarm will encourage her to keep a better medication schedule than she currently does (which is ""whenever""). The monthly fee is more reasonable that other options I've seen.

What I'm hoping is that it will also have a phone app or web site where we can see her activities. This may only be available if paying for the monitoring service, but I can't tell for sure. I would appreciate any and all input from this awesome group, including suggestions if you are using something with your person that might work as well or better. Thanks!","I had tried herohealth and don’t recommend. I tried it for my own used before deploying it on the battlefield and at first it worked great (but was really loud). However, after a while it started not dispensing the pills regularly. Also, it was subscription based, which sucked. Anyway, I’m interested in this, never heard of it!
We use this for my grandma. It has worked really well. She has deteriorated since we started it, so Right now we have cameras in her assisted living apartment. She'll sometimes get distracted, so we can check in on her at her med time, and call her if we need to. At this point, the most we need to do is call, tell her to ""go ahead and put the phone down for a moment to take your meds, then we can get back to gabbing""
Medminder works quite well for my mother in law.
Use Med E Lert for mom. Worked really well for several years. Eventually she would just dump the meds out to stop the alarm and set them aside to take later. Lots of missed doses and finally an overdose because she kept seeing the little piles of pills and thought she needed to take them.

Alzheimers,Installation of a feeding tube (PEG) - My fathers recovery and improvement.,"It was a bit of a fight but my fathers condition declined and he experienced a increasingly frequent difficulty with eating and swallowing (especially with thick liquids) over the last year.  


I best describe it as his having a ""tip of the tongue"" issue with  **initiating the coordination** that is involved in swallowing.  He wanted too swallow (whatever was being fed to him) but a combination of a fear of aspiration and inability to get past some hurdle involved in starting the swallow caused him to not be able to eat or drink.  


He was hungry and thirsty and would hold something easily swallowable like apple sauce in his mouth until he all finally leaked out (he got tired of holding it).   


Now once he got past that hurdle (on a good day) he would eat hungrily and swallow everything just fine but those became less frequent and he started a slow decline in his maintain weight and staying hydrated.   


Knowing my father, his wishes and how he would have handled this for other family members in the same condition I went ahead and advocated for his having [a feeding tube (PEG Tube](https://www.asge.org/home/for-patients/patient-information/understanding-peg)) put in place.   
I was not offered by his (former) primary care physician and when I mentioned it's installation she replied that a ""PEG tube did not extend their life"".  Which reeked of a blatant lie she use her nursing staff to inform me of.

My retort was ""How can proper feeding, hydration and  the giving of medication NOT extend the *quality of life?""    I even went so far as to state that the denial of food and nourishment is something the Nazi's did to people.*   Despite this, the argument of *""quality of life""*  was one that they couldn't get around.  
That it was about the quality of life and how my father wanted to eat... but was in fear of choking.  
We had to change doctors within the hospital system and eventually got multiple referrals from everyone from the speech therapist on up to his new primary physician.   


Then I had deal with multiple refusals and roadblocks from the gastro dept.  


It was the same counter argument from the surgeons in the gastro dept.   
*""It doesn't prolong their life""*  
To which I not only replied that the family is unanimous in it's desire but it's entirely in the keeping of my fathers wishes to have a PEG tube installed so as to  


***""Prevent hunger and to provide proper care and comfort, that it is a matter of good medicine in the alleviation of pain and suffering from hunger""***  


The PEG tube surgery was approved and successfully accomplished as a same day procedure and has been used ever since.   


I'm happy to report that my fathers overall condition has **noticeably improved.**  
He's  alert, his meds and food is given on a regular schedule, he's well hydrated and gaining good weight on his body.  His pressure sores have all healed and he's doing very well (all considering).  


He's  had recovery in his presence of mind and ability to communicate his wishes.  He's also **regained his ability to eat on his own and swallow without difficulty.**  

So he now eats for pleasure and I give him what he asks for...    
(we play 20 questions with a list of foods until I say one that he likes)   
He loves oranges and other fruits, little snacks like [beef jerk](https://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Steak-Strips-Ounces/dp/B01K30Z326/ref=asc_df_B01K30Z326/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241869531501&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5218741398513562805&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061183&hvtargid=pla-668855256888&psc=1)y and has no problem with things like slices of Pizza.  He does this without the risk of choking and the swallowing is perfect.  
This is all on top of his liquid meals that are easy to serve along the meds [I crush in a mortar.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H7DRSM6?ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&th=1)  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


I feel that the doctors in the system often opt for *giving the families an out* and to offer this excuse for not going this route and allowing people to starve as they would in a hospice situation.   It's also possible that the for profit hospitals have a policy to cut costs in care as my father who was in danger of being starved to death is now out of the requests for placement into hospice (meaning that he's no expected to die within 6months time), he's back into the care of his (new) primary physician.  


*One might wonder why I had to fight over 3 months to get this feeding tube installed?*

IF someone starts to experience a difficulty with swallowing due to the progression of the disease I strongly urge you (the family/caregivers) to keep this in mind, that IME, the HMO's will put up roadblocks against a PEG tube as a excuse to withdraw proper care and for the HMO's to save money by lessening the time caring for a patient (legally speeding their demise)

  
It's system wide IME, I've seen people in a memory care facility where they lose the ability to feed themselves (the family gets charged through the roof for the extra time and ""feeding"") The client/victim's get starved over time and when they become weakened, they'll be shuttled off into hospice where they are gone within a month - because they won't try to feed them there.  


Sorry if this hard for some people to read, it's not my intentions.   
I love my father and it hurt me knowing that he was hungry and unable to eat.  
How he felt was clear in his gaze and angry frown as well as his expressions of frustrations at repeatedly trying to initiate a swallow..  and not being able to do it.  


That is torture.  


Now my father is much better off  than he was 2 months ago, he's well fed and comfortable with improved health.","Congratulations on winning this battle on behalf of your father.  I think that sometimes the doctors just go along with the prevailing treatment fad, afraid to stick their necks out - fortunately, you were willing to stick yours out.
You let your father chose what he wanted to the best of his ability, which was exactly the right thing to do. Here’s to being a great advocate!
I thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing your personal experience. My mom is not there yet but as she's an early onset Alzheimer's, I know we will get there at one point and understanding such concrete situations will help me be ready to tackle such situation more peacefully.

I wish your dad and all your family great days ahead of you. Take care!
This really was a great thing to share. We are very much against a feeding tube but this instance your dad wanted to eat but just physically couldn't. I'm going to talk this over with the family and make sure we are all on the same page. Thanks again! Glad you dad has improved!",2022-02-09 23:09:13,eldest-son,sox5tv
Alzheimers,Comfortably Resting,"My loved one is in final stages, no longer eating or taking meds. She had a stroke and lost ability to speak coherently. Her pupils do not respond to light. Yet she does not seem to be in distress -she mostly sleeps. One thing she responds to is music especially when someone sings familiar songs. She tries to sing along.  I found out she likes Tupelo Honey by Van Morrison. I hope the rest of her transition can continue peacefully.","I'm sorry, OP. I'm thankful she does not seem to be in distress. It's the best we can all hope for, right? Keep singing to her
So sorry OP, take solace that she’s about to end an awful journey while still being happy with the music she loves. It’s a terrible experience to go thru, as I have twice, almost 3 times now. I wish you peace.
My mother passed away in August. She lasted 21 days without food or liquid. Just wanted you to know that it can be quick or slow. We played music 24/7. I made a playlist on her Amazon Alexa. She passed peacefully. I wish the same for your loved one.
It's a small mercy that she is not too uncomfortable. And she's got great taste in music! Love that song too!
Thank you for sharing. That sounds lovely. Hearing is the last thing to go, so keep talking to her and playing music :)
Thank you for sharing the tip about music.  I'll try to remember that.  Best wishes.
My heart goes out to you and your loved one.
I'm so sorry you're going through this. My father passed away under similar conditions. He had a stroke and then was in a coma. The doctors told us that any movement he had was just a body reaction to stimuli but I still believe he could hear us. I encourage you to talk to her and give her any last words to make her transition peaceful.
Sorry for your loss,again. This disease makes it feel like they leave us over and over...",2022-02-09 16:50:55,TrinityNotbot,sooz1r
Alzheimers,Sundowning,"Hi lovely people. I am new to this community and could really use some clarity/some help in how to deal with some sundowning. 

My grandmother is 91 and has dementia. The Dr. now suspects she also has Sundowning. She's not at the point where she can't remember her family etc. It's mostly little things. But the biggest struggle is the sundowning. And it's not the typical sundowning I've been reading. She's not forgetful, but she becomes unconsolable in some way or another. Our typical symptom is 'i feel weak' and that she's going to die. Her head starts to hurt to the point of uncontrollable moaning and then she gets so cold. For about 3 hours she's hysterical crying that she's not feeling good and screams over and over that she's cold. Her ears start to ring and she's almost going mad. She never forgets who we are or where she is. She paces the house moaning and screaming and crying and using saying 'why is this happening' 'whats happening' It's terribly unsettling and really taking a toll on everyone. She's usually ok by 7:30/8pm and will go to sleep. The next day she does wake up drained from last nights episode and will cry and be depressed most of the day. By like 12pm-3pm she's pretty good. 

Has anyone else dealt with this type of sundowning before? What are some ways to help her? Calm her down? Is there anything we can do before hand to make it less severe? Since we know the time it's usually going to happen I feel we can try and chase it. Some days she's perfectly fine. My mom is her caregiver and tries to keep her as busy as possible during the day. Giving her little tasks she can handle. Last night the dog jumped on her lap during a very bad episode and that helped a lot. However, I don't live with my parents and her full time and the dog is mine, so thats not always a solution. 

Cheers and love to everyone going through this.","Hey. That sounds awful. I'm so sorry your grandmother and family are going through that. 

My experience was not exactly like that, but the general hysterics at sunset is familiar. 

I'd check to see if anything is physically different in her space.  Is the sun coming in through the windows (close the blinds)? Does the heater not blow as much (or too much) that time of day? Does she have an allergy that the heater makes worse?  Is there pet dander making her allergies worse? Maybe there's a sound, like the sound of the central heating or traffic, that triggers the feeling?  

Check to see if there's something wrong with her body. Again, allergies or something like arthritis, just being tired, having to use the restroom, blood sugar, etc. I'd definitely ask the doc if they have a clue. 

If you can't figure out what, besides the sunset, is triggering the hysterics - brace yourself and try to sooth. It may not work. It may not work everytime.

1. Buy earplugs for yourself. Do anything to keep yourself/family from getting too stressed out. I know it's crappy. but you got to self-preserve. 
2. Try a beanie type hat. My LO loves wearing one all the time. I don't know if the gentle squeeze is comforting, or just the warmth. Worth trying especially since you said your grandma gets cold.
3. Music. Try different kinds. Different volumes. Try dancing with her, like her. I use the same 7 songs whenever I'm trying to calm my LO. We then have radio playlists that are familiar to her. No new music at all. Bummer for me, but I'm not gonna hate too hard on listening to Motown all day.
4. The reddit tinnitus trick: [https://youtu.be/KBgkPOGD6gw](https://youtu.be/KBgkPOGD6gw) it might be a BS but what's the harm? I do it to my LO sometimes. 
5. Acknowledge and redirect. ""Oh man it is so cold! I just turned up the thermostat. Do you want to sit with me under the blanket while it warms up? Ah, your favorite show it on TV!"" blahblahblah
6. If you find something that works/distracts, make it routine. 

Best of luck and hugs all around.
basically... sedate her.  Ask the doctor for a prescription to use just a little before that time.
I dealt with the same thing with my mother. Maybe this can help....

I know that my mother in law suffers from sundowners but it has gotten better with a rigid schedule, light therapy can help. Although your grandmother’s symptoms are pretty wild I do remember my mil calling one of her kids every night complaining of headaches and lots of other things at all hours.  That was when she was in assisted living and in her own apartment, now she is in memory care and on a schedule/ daily routine. I hope you find something that helps, it’s quite a wild ride
I realize you may not be talking about Alzheimer's per se, but a lot of people on the boards at alz.org have found that medication can really help with these sort of outbursts. Do you know if that was raised with her doctor?
Some soft music might help.

Also, if she complains she's cold, wrap her in a blanket.  You might also give her a hot water bottle to hold against her chest or tummy.",2022-02-09 10:12:43,FrancesGumm61022,sofvzy
Alzheimers,How to get help (long - sorry!),"My MIL is in a bad spell lately. My husband has for the past year been visiting her regularly for 2 week stints, working from home there and giving his sister a break from checking on her... During his current trip, she has asked why he's staying so long, why we aren't with him, are he and I getting a divorce, we must not even miss him, etc. She doesn't seem to remember that he's been doing these trips regularly for a year. I'm tired of seeing my husband's siblings not try to help and him afraid of upsetting the apple cart, so started looking up resources in her state. (We live 2 states and 9 hrs away.) I did find a care program that may be of help? To be eligible, a person has to meet 3 of the following: 
 (some she is questionable on, other I think a case can be made for)

1. Basic communication skills – such as using a regular phone, mobile phone, email, or the internet.

Well-- she can use the phone. But often dials a number thinking she is calling person A, and in reality it's person B. And she will forget she has called people, to the point of calling daily and not realizing it's not the first time. She uses NO other technology. Computers are for spying and are evil. We've heard from family members that they call her and she doesn't know who they are.

2. Transportation – either by driving oneself, arranging rides, or the ability to use public transportation.

She lives in a rural area. Doesn't recognize many locations even though she's lived there over 50 years. Talks about several times she's gotten lost. Has even told us about going on a ""Sunday drive"" to see Alaska -- one state west. (No, that is Colorado) 

3. Meal preparation – meal planning, cooking, clean up, storage, and the ability to safely use kitchen equipment and utensils.

She only really uses a microwave. Occasionally uses an electric skillet. Doesn't seem to know how to read packages for cooking info or how to follow a recipe. Will purchase 2lbs of hamburger to make herself a burger and leave the rest to rot in the fridge. If she doesn't later make a meal from spoiled meat. Will go through the trash to pull things out if we clean out her fridge. Has told my husband things like she's never seen pork chops before & doesn't know what they are. Her diet is mostly chicken nuggets, corn dogs, toast, coffee and tea. And driving to town for tacos or burgers.

4. Shopping – the ability to make appropriate food and clothing purchase decisions.

Has little concept of appropriate amounts of food to buy, and it's like shopping with a 5 yr old. She can buy clothes when needed. But suspect she is with her daughter when she does so.

5. Housework – doing laundry, washing dishes, dusting, vacuuming, and maintaining a clean place of residence. 

Mostly ok, til you consider the pipe delusion -- she had a cracked sewer pipe last year. SIL had it repaired. She still swears it's broken and dumping raw sewage under the house. Tells us she needs to crawl under it and clean up, and will pee in a cup, and poop in a bin with a sack in it and throw it in the trash. (Though this delusion hasn't been brought up during husband's current stay) Aside from that, housecleaning is something that she is fanatic about & seems to be muscle memory.

6. Managing medications – taking the correct amount of medication at the correct time. Managing re-fills, and avoiding conflicts.

She has been on blood pressure meds for decades, but if she had to add something new? She cancels Dr appts if they call to confirm with her, so her daughter has told Drs to confirm through her instead of her mom. She doesn't really know why she is seeing any particular Dr. 

7. Managing personal finances – operating within a budget, writing checks, paying bills, and avoiding scams

My husband says she can still do this. Til I point out his sister actually does a lot of the bill paying and management of her bank account. She can't really avoid scams; she thinks phone company reps are trying to scam her, yet has almost fallen for several scam calls til my husband or his sister step in. She only uses checks, but now that many places don't take them, she gets frustrated easily. As when getting groceries.

So! If you've had experience with assistance programs, does all this sound like enough to qualify her? It's really hard on my husband, and I am hoping to find an answer that doesn't mean declaring her incompetent but that eases some of the burden from him.","My husband and I have spent the last two years trying to find a memory care hospital for his father who has early onset Alzheimer's.  He was 59 when diagnosed and didn't qualify for any programs due to his age.  

Now 61 and we just finished moving him into a memory care unit in AZ yesterday.  We tried EVERYTHING from Alzheimer's support groups and info guides, contacting local groups in AZ for elders and Alzheimer's, etc.  What FINALLY got him care was calling Adult Protective Services.  He couldn't operate a microwave anymore and lost a lot of weight.  Due to the weight loss (not the act of not being able to operate a microwave) he qualifies for care.  

Try calling APS and maybe they can help!
Yeh, it sure is hard, trying to manage / help from afar.  Good on yr husband going for weeks at a time!  I'm in another country, so don't know how it works there, but I'd recommend you contact your area alzheimers .org or dementia .org - they have tons of resources & info & can help you with many aspects of living with memory loss issues.   best of luck!",2022-02-09 01:14:28,birthwarrior,so6hqe
Alzheimers,Parent with Alzheimer’s in the same home as young children,"Hello everyone, new to the sub. Just looking for some advice from more experienced caregivers and maybe some encouragement that we didn’t make a horrible choice. 

My MIL is 66. Alzheimer’s ran strong in her family- her mother and sister both passed away from it before age 75. I believe her sister only lived for 2-3 years after her diagnosis. My FIL passed away in November 2019 (she was 64 at the time) and she was exhibiting pronounced odd behaviors and executive functioning/memory issues during the aftermath of his death. At the time her kids attributed it to grief and stress. We now suspect that her symptoms started much earlier and that they both (FIL and MIL) took steps to minimize or hide them. So it’s possible that she would have been an early onset diagnosis but we don’t know for sure. 

She sold their home without any plans for her living situation. She moved in with her daughter but they have never had a great relationship and it caused her significant stress and depression. So she moved in with us. It became apparent to us very quickly that she should not be living alone without assistance. We are a young family, our first child is 19 months and we do plan to have more. She has now been living with us for a year. During the year she’s been here we have managed to confront the deficits in her functioning. She went to primary care first, where she scored an 11/30 (I believe) on the memory screener. She went back 6 months later and did just as poorly. She was referred to the senior health and memory center. Her initial appointment was with a social worker, they gave her the test again and she did worse. Her next appointment was with the geriatrician 2 months later and she took it again and scored a 7/30. They were very concerned as she was a teacher with a master’s degree, although she also wasn’t trying very hard and she gets very angry and distressed during those tests. They asked for a CT scan to rule out stroke or tumors and it was normal. They then asked for a paper and pencil memory test. The accumulation of appointments (Gyno, primary care, routine screenings, etc.) really got to her and she refused the test and any more appointments. She began saying that she cared for her mother with Alz, that the memory tests are demeaning and degrading, that there is nothing they can do for her, and that she will not spend her remaining time going to endless appointments. They closed her referral and to my knowledge never officially diagnosed her.

When all of this was happening, we decided as a family that she could live with us permanently. She is fine money-wise, so she contributed half the cost and we are building a new home where she has a bedroom and bath on the entry level. We move in July. She is able to pay privately for some in-home assistance if/when we need it. We have set up her PoA for medical and financial, set up a trust for her kids. Right now she is doing okay. Her physical health is great. She can still handle her hygiene needs, her appetite is okay, she doesn’t wander or hallucinate. I work from home so I am with her at all times. She does drink wine every night (1-2 glasses) after we go upstairs to bed and she gets extremely defensive and depressed when we suggest she should reduce her intake. We are trying to walk the line of giving her autonomy and when to step in and control things. 

I am just so worried about keeping our children, and her, safe and happy as this progresses. She wants so badly to spend her last years around family and her grandkids. She loves playing with my son. I just don’t want her to put anyone’s safety at risk, I don’t want to cause my kids unnecessary distress, and I want her to feel comfortable. But I don’t know what the next steps are. Am I overthinking this too soon?","You are definitely not overthinking or contemplating this too soon. Now is the time to put together plans B & C, not when you're already in a crisis and your options are limited. People with dementia and young children often do not mix. I could list out all the possible issues and risks you and your kids may face, but you have probably already thought of many of them especially if you're already familiar with dementia behaviors and have seen how the disease changes someone's personality. It won't hurt to research and lay out all of your options for the future. Hopefully your spouse is in agreement with considering other options and the threshold in which you will use them. In addition to the home caregivers, look into adult daycare near you (where she can be dropped off during day time hours), and respite facilities (where she can stay for a couple weeks or longer). And of course, check out other permanent living arrangements such as Memory care, including whether the facilities you like have waiting lists and whether she can afford them (and for how long). Hopefully, you are confident she will never need Medicaid to pay for a facility if her own funds run out because you've possibly just created a sticky situation by purchasing a home with her (or maybe her estate attorney has already addressed this). I kept all my research of resources and other options in a folder, including things I never thought I'd use, and when things changed I actually did go back to it and ended up using services I never thought I would.
Try getting her on a list for daytime adult day care.  She may not need it now, but there may be a long wait list.  Good luck.
You and your husband are really wonderful people! It sounds like things are manageable for now - but each person's decline is unique to them. Some people just fade away, some...not so much. 

I think the first thing (if you haven't already) to do is get DURABLE Power of Attorney and Health Surrogate responsibilities legally set up for your husband. I'm amazed at how difficult things could have been here (I am currently living with my parents due to my mother's dementia and my father's fragility) if I hadn't set those up, as well as put their assets in a Trust, years ago. My one sibling who has never been a problem has suddenly become a huge one, and my having solid legal ground to stand on makes my taking care of my parents possible. 

Make sure you and your husband have scheduled ""check ins"" with each other about the situation. What's working, what isn't, and what are steps you can take to ensure everyone's safety.  Talking to her doctors and looking into medication for her agitation/depression is something to consider. 

Know that at some point, MIL may have to be placed in a facility. We're in the process right now and it's a difficult decision but it's the only way to keep everyone safe and alive. 

&#x200B;

My thoughts are with you.
You got a lot of good suggestions. I would also suggest you have a lockable perimeter fence, so if/when she starts wandering you wont stress as much hopefully. 

You can also look for an Alzheimer's Association support group (or similar) near you. Many may be meeting online bc covid. If you can find one in your county its best, bc they may know of people or orgs or resources in *your* area. But you'll also get to hear personal stories of people going thru the same thing, at different stages. This may help give you an idea of the variability in dementia that could be coming your way. 

In regards to them with little kids: you'll just have to wait and see. At some point you'll likely note you shouldn't leave them alone with your kids, for their physical safety. But there could also be emotional aspects too, and its kind of hard to tell how much you need to protect them from it until its there. 

There are children's books and resources for explaining Alzheimer's to kids. https://www.alz.org/help-support/resources/kids-teens/for_kids ..

But beyond gentle explanations you may also have to watch for straight up abuse. I mean a previously loving grandma can turn VENOMOUS to their loved ones bc of Alzheimer's, with no explanation other than the disease. But some folks remain or even become extraordinarily sweet and more loving than before. As far as I know, you'll just have to watch, stay in tune with your in law, *and* your kids. 

Good luck.
First I want to tell you that taking in a parent with Alzheimer’s is a big commitment and I commend you for stepping in. That being said, as she gets worse things will become harder on you and your family.  I currently live with my parents who take care of my grandmother with late stage Alzheimer’s. I also have a 6 month old baby. I cannot and will not leave her and the baby alone in the same room together for safety reasons. That means baby is near me or my parents at all times which is extremely tiring. She used to not have violent outbursts but as she’s progressed she’s become violent. And by violent I mean hitting, pushing, and throwing things. She also has hallucinations (the other day she thought my baby was a cat and was mad at me for holding him) on top of this and a variety of bad behaviors (including swearing, tantrums, constant noises, breaking things, is mean and extremely demanding). Not trying to scare you but these things could possibly come as your MIL gets worse. I’m actively trying to get out of this living situation since it’s made my life with my child so much more difficult. Other things that may occur are her hygiene and ability to take care of herself will go.  My nan frequently has poop under her nails, only bathes when forced too, has to be in diapers, etc. Poop has been smeared on the walls multiple times. I paint you this vivid picture because that’s what most likely coming. As a parent to a young child you have so many other things that you are responsible. My parents are both retired and it’s essentially a full time job taking care of my grandmother and it has nearly broke them. I plead with you to be proactive now so you can make informed decisions later. I will tell you that getting my nan on hospice was the best thing to happen. They take care of baths and hygiene and handle her meds and other medical needs. There is also support for you including a social worker, chaplain, options for temporary respite care, and sitters. So when she progresses I highly recommend asking her doctor about hospice. I’m sorry you are having to go through this. No one should ever have to.

Make sure you have your bases covered here. Make sure the estate lawyer is getting an OFFICIAL “child caretaker exemption” transfer of property agreement once she has drained her liquid assets and needs ongoing care either at home, or in a memory care home paid by Medicaid without getting any lien on “her” estate.

Also, while you’re building that home i think it will be very important to make sure it has a full barrier-free shower, with ample space to maneuver a walker/wheelchair plus another person in the bathroom. 

A kitchenette would be nice too, so her caretaker and pop into the microwave meals on wheels. You will also want to make sure the door to her space can be locked externally to prevent wandering. 

also, get a bidet toilet. build a wall-hung toilet into that wall now. and a LOT of extra studs interspersed for new grab bars wherever necessary.
I moved back to my child hood home with my wife and two young kids in early 2018 to care for my mother who was already in late stage Alz since late 2016. She was already walking in circles around the house, mumbling nonsense, yelling at ""ghosts,"" getting up in the middle of night making random messes knocking over furniture, decor, and misc papers/mail/magazines, etc. She would ""drop and go"" in the trash cans (yes, what you think I mean is exactly what I mean), and later right in the middle of the floor (yes it was really really bad).

It's been 4 years now and about 16 years since her dementia first appeared. As of late 2020 she lost the ability to walk and stand. Now over 15 months later at age 87 she is stiff as statue with her eyes always closed in a hospital bed towards the back of the house mumbles maybe a dozen words during the day, nothing really coherent, but can still swallow Ensure drinks in a toddler sippy cup and squeeze style pack baby food. To say it's a miserable existence for her is an understatement. She feels no pain and only minimal discomfort when we have to change her. Nothing about any of this is easy, as it is an absolute emotional drain.

Luckily my kids today ages 7 and 12 seem mostly unaffected since their grandma is in the back area of the house living room area downstairs while my kids are mostly upstairs or in the front living room. My kids were never that close to my mom which at this point is probably a good thing which I may be sad about later but ""works"" in the current arrangement. My mom lost most of her memory 5 years ago and even forgot me (her only child) about 3 years ago.

My 90 year old (divorced) dad stays with with us too and he helps look after her as well, but obviously the bulk of this burden lands square onto me as my mid-40 year old self who had to abandon everything 4 years ago to start this journey decided to avoid the costs of a nursing home in an attempt to preserve the estate which so far made much more sense financially since I'm the sole beneficiary. No can understand how today she is even still alive now, as even her doctor had put her on hospice almost 2 years ago. I simply follow a daily routine and just pretend every day is groundhog day until the end finally comes which really seems to be this year by all accounts.

Just understand that it's a very long term commitment, every situation is different, and make sure the necessary care and finances make sense early on, otherwise the entire situation can turn into an absolute nightmare later on. My case seems to be the outlier though since most patients don't seem to last as long as my mom has so far. Most don't make it to the ""paralyzed in bed"" phase luckily. This disease is a moving target with the patient so you will learn to adjust as time goes on regardless. Good luck!
She may become aggressive,it's often part of the process. Grumpy and petulant,mean even. These behaviors will not be controlled around the kids, if they occur. My teenage children find it difficult to be around their grandfather and when he's angry they get kinda frightened,planning ahead is the way to go.
I was a kid when my grandma was taking care of her demented mother. She mostly just sat in front of the TV and didn't really interact with us kids. She had some issues with wetting herself and she was sometimes rough with grandma when she took care of her (washing, clothing, stuff like that). 

Even though I was very little, I understood Nonna is sick and not all there and I didn't really have an issue with it all. 

I'm actually taking care of my grandma now, she's having issues with dementia as well, although it seems to be progressing rather slowly and she is still keeping up with all of her routines.
A lot of people have already added great perspectives in the comments. I’d just like to say, as someone who has lived for a long time with a grandparent suffering from demetia, that your concerns in regards to young children are very valid. Unfortunately, the disease tends to progress and this can go for decades so it is important to be aware that you will be raising a child who will have very close contact with that reality. And it will mature faster than it should at some point. So it is wise to keep in mind other options as well, even if you are able to welcome her permanently.",2022-02-08 12:00:12,KahluaPiper,snp056
Alzheimers,I feel helpless…,"My grandmother who’s 87 was been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s many years ago, I never actually knew my grandma. I never felt the connection that grandmother and granddaughters would normally share, I never knew what she was like before her Alzheimer’s set it. All I knew is that she was a very distant woman with her family and never contacted them unless she needed money. I never learned to love my grandma. Fast forward to todays timeline, my grandmas Alzheimer’s has gotten worse. I have many uncles and aunts, out of my 4 aunts only 1 has been able to take care of my grandma for about a year until she got fed up and now my grandma bounces houses between my uncle and dad. This of course confuses my grandma even more. The neurologist tells them it’s unhealthy for her to change houses every 2 weeks but my uncle and dad are very stubborn. But what hurts me the most is to see my mom struggle with grandmother. My dad hardly if ever lends a helping hand, I try to help to my best of abilities but I can only do so much. My dad pokes at my grandma to make her upset sometimes because he finds it amusing and the one who has to deal with it is my mom. My moms mental health has declined so much. This morning I woke up to find her with red eyes, I knew she was crying at night. I know my mom doesn’t want to take care of my grandmother. My dad obviously doesn’t care enough to notice. He tells my mom that he’s fed up with her for not wanting to take care of her mother-in-law. My dad can’t comprehend that my mom isn’t cut out to take care of someone with such a disease. My grandmother isn’t friendly either the other day she was claiming to everyone that she hasn’t eaten and proceeded to hit my mom once she was told she had just ate. And my dad? No where to be seen to put the situation at ease, the only one that can really calm her is my dad. And when my dad gets fed up with her he yells and throws a tantrum, but my mom? God forbid if my dad ever sees my mom frustrated with my grandma. My mom was diagnosed with depression not a few weeks ago and I don’t know what to do or say or how to help. I just don’t know anymore. Everyday it’s the same my grandma would pee on the floor overnight only for my mom to find it and clean it up in the morning, bickering between my grandma over whether or not she ate, she’s constantly checking everything to find something, everyday something goes missing because my grandma will hide it, we can’t take my grandma anywhere because she has a habit of stealing or calling people mean things. I hate all of this","God. Taking abuse from your own mom with dementia is bad enough. At least there are decades of love and trust there. My great-grandmother lived to be 98. Her daughter spent so many years sacrificing her own health to care for her, that she died some 2 years later at age 81. And g-grandma was just old, she did not have dementia, and she was A NICE PERSON.

Taking abuse from your husband's mom, when even healthy MIL/Daughter-in-law relationships are already riddled with power struggles, MIL is already primed to assert dominance over her son's wife... and your husband doesn't even defend you... is truly next-level.

I think you need to talk to your dad directly without mom even in the room. 40% of Alzheimer's caregivers die BEFORE THE PATIENT, of stress-related disorders. In my opinion, Grandma is stealing healthy years from your mom's life expectancy. Both now, *and* on the backend.
If you are willing to share what state you live in, or if it is another country, maybe people can give you more specific advice both for pragmatics (how to get a state-paid nursing home) and/or culturally specific advice.
The dynamic between your parents is not very healthy.  I feel really sorry for your mom.  At the same time, it's not something you can fix.  I agree with the doctor, constantly moving your grandmother is hard for her to adjust to.  She really belongs in memory care, and your family could have a more normal life.  Unless she is very wealthy, she ought to qualify for some financial assistance from the government to pay for that.  Hasn't anybody ever brought that up before?",2022-02-08 11:58:08,IndicaRuby,snoy8q
Alzheimers,Looking for scripture to read to my grandpa who has pretty progressed Alzheimers. Any recommendations?,,"What a beautiful idea. Many Christians find both power and familiarity in the four gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). Psalms is also generally filled with comfort, lament, praise, reflections, and emotions that may be both familiar and easy to connect to. I’m not as familiar with scriptures from other religious traditions.

Consider reading from the translation and version that he used and understood the most. (Perhaps also play or sign hymns or scriptural songs if he likes those.)
Revelation 21:4 has always been comforting then there is the 23rd Psalm.
Psalm 91 is nice.

Alzheimers,My grandma is finally at a home,"She’s finally at her apartment as we reference it. It’s brand new but the company has a great reputation. It couldn’t have happened at a better time too. Due to the stress and progression, she has started to hallucinate. Her speech has gotten significantly worse and she’s forgetting the people she sees daily. 

I love her so much and I hope that this week she has a few good moments. It’s going to be a hard transition for sure but I’m grateful for the place she found. 

What I’m even more grateful for her is that since she is one of the first people to move to that unit, they exempted her from the “move in” fee. I found out that that’s normal but at her place it would’ve been $6,000. 

Looking forward to seeing her at the end of the month. Even with all the drama and family issues, I’m taking today to be proud of her from afar and hope she sleeps well.","Good on you, it's a hard sad milestone, but also all fr the best.

Alzheimers,Third Rodeo In This Hell,"Hi All -- 

New here as it only occurred to me to look for a community on Reddit now. I'm in that place (that I've been for a long time) where it's all feeling so heavy, too heavy, and I'm alone. 

My mom had early onset FTD in her mid-40s and died at 59 (my age 10 onward). I'm the youngest of 3 and my 2 older sisters (both mid 40s) have early onset Alzheimers. One much worse than the other.

I live on the other side of the country from them all but my entire life is now thinking about this disease, either about my sisters or about my own potential to be next (yes, I know there are tests. I haven't decided what I'm going to do about that yet). 

I'm exhausted, I'm angry, I'm sad, and I wish I had support + people who understood the heaviness. 

Thank you for letting me have this moment to share and I promise to read your many posts before mine and give thoughts and encouragement.","I'm so sorry, OP. My dad just passed two months ago from Alzheimer's and I fear every day that my mom will get it, too. I don't think I could do it again. I don't have anything else to say except I'm sorry.
This sounds hormone related to me. I'm not an expert but I would absolutely take HRT.  I've seen so many posts with women getting this disease so young and I don't see what else it can be related to.
That’s a lot. I’m so sorry. ❤️
Thank you for sharing your situation, OP, and welcome to this community. You’ll find a lot of support here. I’m so sorry to hear what you’re going through. I’m going through it with my mom, 58, right now at 26. It’s heartbreaking. Sending you comfort and strength
Oh gosh, EmRosePh, so very sorry, that really sucks, it's sad.   Yeh, sometimes seems hard to get out of the all-consuming bubble, I feel for you!  It took me also years to find this sub, for so long I felt alone & unsupported - all our family are interstate (except one, & she doesn't count).  There are some fb groups but, idk about for your appropriate to your situation.  

I care for my now 89yr old mum, 10 yrs since Alzhms diagnosis.  I was living overseas for many years, started to spend 6 months a year back home, since 5 yrs I'm here full time 24/7 carer.  Gave up my life, friends, everything.  My older sister lives at mums, she has significant horrid unaddressed mental health issues, so yeh, it was / is a shit-show. 

 Me too sometimes I fear for my future, if I'll also get it - and I don't have a partner or any kids who might care or help me out.  Just gonna have to cross my fingers & wing it.  Maybe for that, I'll settle on the 'denial' strategy for a while, lol.  

It's all very well to say 'get some counselling/therapy', or 'join a support group' or 'don't dwell on it' - it's not always just so easy as that.  I hope you don't get too depressed dipping into this sub, I hope you do feel at least the kindredship of folk who understand what you went & are going through.   I hope you find moments of peace & joy in your life!
I would be more then happy to talk to you & invite you to a facebook group for support. I read your post & wanted to ask for clarity. Your mom & 2 sisters have it - does your family have Early onset familial Alzheimer disease (eFAD) - the genetic kind? If so, I can get you in touch with others that can relate. My family carries the PSEN1 mutation- it’s autosomal dominant which means there’s a 50-50 chance of passing it. My mother & brother had it - I am 46 and haven’t been tested. let me know if you want to talk",2022-02-07 18:43:49,EmRosePh,sn4tfj
Alzheimers,Both sides of my family have Alzheimer's.,I'm scared that I'm going to get it. I don't want to forget my life. How do I prevent myself from getting this?,"There isn't a way to prevent it currently as it's not curable. I also have it on both sides and I understand the worry you're feeling. You may want to discuss your concerns with your doctor so they can test you to see if you have any genetic variants and discuss changes you might make in your life to delay Alzheimer's. (ie healthy eating, no alcohol, etc)

Beyond that, you may want to journal each day if that's something you might enjoy to keep personal records of your life that you can reflect back on later.
There's relatively little you CAN do. Eat MIND diet, exercise a bunch, do crossword puzzles, don't drink much alcohol, and even then you may.
23andme will tell you what Alzheimer's genes you carry. It might be a relief to know one way or the other.
Some evidence points at getting a good night's sleep every night. In addition to living a healthy lifestyle, of course.
Die young, and leave a good-looking corpse.
There’s some interesting claims behind lions mane mushrooms
Eat healthy and exercise but quite frankly as of right now there is nothing that will really prevent it 

You can get tested to see if you have the genetic variants but that will just tell if you have the gene - not really anything out there at the moment that will make a big difference 

So sorry to be so glum about it - it is something I worry about as well. Definitely had a couple therapy sessions about it
It's a tough one but it's still luck of the draw to some extent. We have an entire branch of the family tree that had it but underneath that only my dad. My Nan and her siblings lived quite happily into their 70s without it being an issue. Dad was literally high risk everything because of lifestyle factors: lived alone, deaf, poor diet, minimal exercise etc. None of his 4 siblings show any signs. The lifestyle factors sound patronising but it's the impact is pretty huge. In the future, we're probably all going to be advised to take anti-inflammatories from our mid forties (2 aspirin a day) and women will be told to have HRT when they go through menopause. It's not worth worrying about too much but be careful with brain health and keep an eye on cognitive trials. I know it's scary but put one foot in front of the other and keep moving, life is meant to be lived x
Sorry. The devil made me do it.
OP, it's not hopeless. There are several things you can do that may not prevent, but can help:

Practice Kirtan Kriya chanting meditation - It's described on the Alzheimers website [here](https://alzheimersprevention.org/research/12-minute-memory-exercise/).

Here are a few sources showing how this particular meditation is helpful to the brain: 
https://alzheimersprevention.org/research/kirtan-kriya-yoga-exercise/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540331/ https://www.ijhsr.org/IJHSR_Vol.11_Issue.1_Jan2021/IJHSR35.pdf

Fasting- intermittent fasting is showing promising results to help with brain function. Fasting can basically be 16 hours off from eating/8 hours on. It sounds difficult but it's not once you get used to it.  source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7379085/

As others have said, veggies and and making exercise a daily habit is also helpful.

Good luck to you.",2022-02-07 18:17:40,Similar-Captain-6683,sn471y
Alzheimers,Transition to Memory-care,"My MIL was diagnosed over 6 years ago. It's been a slow progression, buthas now reached a place where she can no longer be taken care of in a safe way 24/7. My wife and SIL decided that memory-care was the best option.

Does anybody have any advice on how to manage the transition? She's on the waiting list and realistically that could be months before she moves in. Based on past experiences, is there anything we can do to help prepare for the move? Any way to make that transition easier?

Thank you!","It really depends on what stage your MIL is at. When we placed my mom in care she was not aware of reality. I told her she and my dad were going on vacation and when we got to the facility I told her it was the resort (it really does look like a tropical resort). She oohed and aahed over the room and as we walked around the grounds. 

Before she got there I prepared her room. I put up shelves in her room to put up knick knacks (nothing valuable) and had my dad pick out HIS favorite shirts she wore. We visited everyday, sometimes twice a day to make sure she felt comfortable. She did not ask to go home because she had been in the hospital for a month due to a fall and she went directly from the rehabilitation facility to the residence. She had forgotten home by that point.

She would ask for my dad and I would say he was on his way but needed to run some errands first. Honestly my dad had a harder time with it than she did. I was the one who did all of the preparation to spare him the guilt.
Very important to make sure she has her own things (pictures, furniture, bedding) that she feels comfortable with.  They will probably tell you not to visit for the first week or so, so that she is not begging every day to go home.  It will be a hard transition.  Hopefully having her husband there will help.
Make a photo album with some basic info… [something like this](https://montessoridementia.org/file/memory-book-template) include an info sheet at least with a short bio, and favorite songs/music, sports teams, etc so staff can connect, converse, and help them feel known and comfortable. You can also create a memory box with favorite items. Personalize their room with familiar items, ideally before the move in day so it ready when they get there. 

Encourage everyone in the family to stick to a simple script. Use the same words and be consistent. Don’t fabricate stories, be direct: This is your new home. You are safe here. 

When you visit, go for activities and meals and encourage their participation. 

Leading up to moving, discuss it if possible, depending on cognition. Validate their feelings and listen. This is a loss for them, as well as a compassionate choice for everyone.",2022-02-06 13:08:02,lmfine,sm373o
Alzheimers,need advice,i found out today that my grandpa has Alzheimer’s and its really shocking and i dont know how to react my dad is not taking it that well and i don’t blame him. the only thing that keeps coming in my head is that he’s going to forget me and everyone else and i just dont know how to feel right now is there any advice that you guys can give me on how to deal with this and be there for my family,"I agree with what 'lookthepenguins' said.

Yes you are all in for a truckload of sadness... my advice is to take each day as it comes.  Make the most of the good times for however long they last.

Best of all - hugs and kisses, holding hands,  singing with your grampa... he may forget your name, he may forget the past,  but in the present he will know that you are someone kind and loving in his life.
Ohh, so sorry - yeh, it's sad.  Well for a start, sometimes it can take years before they get so bad - sure, sometimes sooner - nobody ever knows how it's going to go until it's happening.   My mum had diagnosis in 2009, she still knows who we all are, but other people can get to that state in a few years.   Yeh, it's shocking and sad to find that out, sorry eh.  

Absolutely, please contact yr area alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org.  They are experienced expert professionals & have TONS of information & resources for the memory-lossed, their family / friends / carers.   The more info you & your family have about it, how it might progress, management tactics & tips, etc etc, the better for you all.  They have web-sites, offices for visits, telephone help-lines... We even did some mini-workshops & courses about it - what to maybe expect, how to help them live a good life, etc. 

For the time being, don't be doom & gloom with yr grandpa.  Don't treat him like an invalid or a terminal patient.  Help him live his best life, & enjoy doing cool stuff with him!   Best of luck!
My advice is stop thinking of how unfortunate you are that your grandfather is going to forget you and will probably die a very slow, unhappy death, inconveniencing everyone.

Instead think of things he likes to do, think of what you can offer your dad in terms of practical help, it could be as simple as stay there while he runs some personal errands, or washing some dishes.

What I'm saying is, turn your thoughts to what others are going through, and away from ""Oh God, why is this happening to MEEEEEEE.""

A few years ago, I had a small, early breast cancer that was quickly dealt with (surgery plus radiation).  My daughter, instead of asking what she could do to help, was all ""I can't take finals - my mother has breast cancer!""  In other words, it was all about HER, and not about me, the patient.
Firstly, it's ok to have the shock. Dad needs some time to be upset. But he shouldn't try to process his feelings with Grandpa and make him feel guilty. Try to focus on what Grandpa CAN do, and what he CAN enjoy, today. Go through photo albums with him (as a fun activity!! don't pressure him with the dementia) and get him to name places and faces so that you have it recorded.  He can still enjoy most activities. If his home is safe (no stairs, easy walking distance to shops), Grandpa can have an independent, normal-feeling life for many years.
There is plenty of time for thinking about all of the bad stuff that your grandpa and family are going to experience as this disease progresses,  now you need concentrate on all of the wonderful family memories he has, all of the amazing music and films he experienced in his younger years.

Good luck.






First of all I am truly sorry. This disease is brutal, merciless and unforgiving.

Try to live and take each day as it comes. Some days are gonna be good and some days are gonna be bad. I understand how you feel about all you can think of is your grandpa forgetting you and I totally get that. I'm dreading the day mum forgets my siblings and myself and my dad. I'm dreading the day my daughter asks about nan and why she doesn't remember her.

The thing about this disease is that it's so different for everyone. I'm really hoping for a slow decline for you guys so you guys can make the most of things.

I don't have much more advice but feel free to PM me if you need to just chat about things. Definitely also look into therapy for yourself and your dad as well.",2022-02-06 07:01:10,Glad-Ad124,slv3a8
Alzheimers,What I didn’t anticipate…,"My moms case has been fairly slow in progression for the previous 5 years but has started to ramp up since 2020. I haven’t yet decided if that’s a blessing or a curse.  She is 84 so hopefully old age takes her faster than the disease. My 85yo dad is her caretaker or should I say gatekeeper.  He needs support to continue to manage her but ultimately he lets her make the decisions. She needs reassessment but …. “I don’t want to push her” “She said no” “She changed her mind.”

She wanders the house all day rearranging things: “I’m downsizing” She hoardes food in her room, makes grocery lists - and yet there are 8 containers {48in total} of Costco muffins in the freezer. Why? Because she insists on sending my dad - who will do anything to please her- out into the world. I’m certain he enjoys getting away to some extent.  Who wouldn’t, but often returns to petulance…. “I was dressed and waiting at the door, calling, why didn’t you wait?” (never true.) Did I mention he has End Stage COPD and a pacemaker?  In a pandemic. 

She’s hidden all of the family’s generational jewelry, gawd knows where. 7 days ago she soiled her pants and tho she still had the presence of mind to change, she has hidden them in her room. To that end, I’ve never seen her wash her own clothes (they smell of course) but washes dad’s compulsively.  

She is incredibly possessive of her role as a (barely capable) homemaker. She mistreats anyone (me) who tries to help after watching her struggle for 3 hours in making grilled cheese sandwiches.  She has taken to drying linen tea towels in the oven as it ‘cools 😮 I made dad buy a fire extinguisher but it’s still in its original packaging… in the car… 3 months later… in no danger of being useful if needed. Why? Because “mom won’t like it.” With his COPD he couldn’t get to it in time or he’d collapse trying. Can I have a ‘WTF’ here? 

She is incredibly possessive of my father and has jealously threatened him that it’s either her or the cat. She doesn’t care if we (herself included) starve until dinner but if I prep a breakfast or lunch for dad and I, she petulantly exclaims that she was going to surprise him with xyz meal (not so)

What I didn’t anticipate was the way I’d resent this angry, mean, manipulative, paranoid woman who has snatched my mom’s body and taken the family hostage.

I feel terrible for complaining but I’m basically her punching bag & it hurts. 

Vent over 

Edited for spelling.","If I were you, I would buy a Tundra fire extinguisher can from First Alert.  It looks like a red can of PAM cooking spray.  You take the plastic wrap off of the sprayer, and put it where your Dad can get to it.  If there is a fire (god forbid), it would be much easier to use for an elderly person.  Your Mom is definitely progressing, and the only consolation is that the next phase may be the ""sleeping all the time"" phase.  You can get much more done when she gets there.  Unfortunately, your Dad is in need of almost as much help as she is.  It is very difficult to change 60+ years of roles and habits.  Stay strong, Caregiver Warrior....you have a ways to go.
I commiserate with you. My grandfather died young long ago, while his kids were still in their teens. My mom has told me, if he hadn't died way back then he would be suffering now due to his wife/her mom, exactly the way you describe. Grandma has served as the sole caregiver for her disabled son for decades. And as we have transitioned an exit ramp for him these couple years, she *fought* very simple ideas that would make his life a little easier and better. Like, signing him up for a weekly art class for disabled adults at the local community center. That made her angry! Because her caring for her son is not even about his best interest anymore, it is about her having a purpose in life. So she is extremely possessive of that role. She is 90 and on hospice now. Every time we need to change her diaper, she kicks and screams so much you'd think she was being tortured. Three times a day. We are just trying to carry her to the finish line with as much dignity left as possible.

40% of Alzheimer's caregivers die before the patient, of stress-related disorders. I think it's time to look into a nursing home for mom. At least to start arranging all the finances (possibly divorce) so that she qualifies for government assistance. Or else, Alzheimer's could steal your dad prematurely too.
This is exactly the situation we were in, and then my dad who had no health issues had a stroke, a brain tumor was found on the MRI, and it was over. Suddenly, I was the one available to be with her. Doing everything her doctor's said (as I caught her up on all the appointments my dad had given up trying to get her to) by putting in security cameras to monitor her when we were not with her, setting her up with medical alert systems (she put them right into the trash the minute we left) getting her meals all set and ready to microwave (the dogs got them for dinner along with their dog food). It was overwhelming. 

We'd cut power to her stove/oven or turn off gas to her heating system (she liked to turn up the heat as high as it would go on hot, humid days or turn it off in the middle of winter). She was able to turn the gas or power back on. It became a never-ending battle of wills.

For missing jewelry, if she hasn't thrown it away, my mom's favorite hiding spot (we found it later when we were moving her into assisted living) was behind the access panel to her bathtub. This meant she had to pull out all of the storage baskets, get down on her hands and knees, lean into the bathroom closet, remove the screws, pull off the panel, and then put everything back in place. Yet, my husband saw a bra strap sticking out and found that was where she'd hidden all of the bras she'd accused others of stealing.

We took her out to lunch one day, we returned and she started yelling at us for bringing her to a stranger's house. She didn't recognize her own house, and it was the home she'd been in for more than 50 years. That's when we decided we couldn't do it anymore. We sold the house and used the equity to pay for assisted living. That ended up being the best choice for her. The first place she was in was ill-prepared for Alzheimer's, as we learned, but the second place was fantastic and she made friends and didn't want us hanging around as much.
I’m sorry. No one should see their mother go through this awful disease. 

Does she have a neurologist? Is she taking any medication for her Alzheimer’s? It sounds like it is becoming to much for your dad to manage. A doctor could help with medication or to put in some boundaries - at least they did with our mom.
At times I had to say right to dementia patient ""Your freedoms are causing me all kinds of hardships!  I'm making some rules (and taking things away) to make things easier around here.  Do you want to live here with me, or go to memory care?""

He improved his behavior for a few hours.  sigh.
Thank you for sharing. I’m sorry for your struggle. I’m hoping I can get my dad to visit his SIL who lives in one of these retirement resorts. She is the widow of my dad’s brother who died of dementia so maybe she can help him realize that this could be a good thing for mom and certainly for him. 

We have 2 modes of thinking: analytical & intuitive. Dementia obliterates analytical & leaves behind intuitive which is why there is no point in asking who, what, where, when, why and how type questions. As toddlers, we develop intuitive thinking first. That’s what dementia patients are left with and why they so closely resemble toddlers feeling allll the feels with no way to adequately express themselves. 

I mean,  I can reason this out in my brain and yet I still have a hard time wrapping my head around the resulting behaviour. 

This disease is a particular brand of horror

Alzheimers,I Said Goodbye Today...,"I've lived with my grandma my whole life (33 years). She always gave me food, shelter, and even helped pay for college. We are a poor family and I'm the first to get a bachelors in my family thanks to her. We've lived in this trailer since I was 1 year old. These days she acts like she's in another world, she cries frequently, she can't form sentences, she obsessively picks at the carpet, she's forgotten her husband (died 1996) and parents and me, and she requires assistance with everything.

Today when I finished feeding her, I asked if she remembers all the times she said ""I had the best grandma"". She said ""yes"". I told her that ""I think I have the best grandma"". I told her how much I appreciate everything she's done for me in her lifetime and that I love her, and I already miss her so much. Her response was half of an incoherent sentence before she took a bite using her invisible spoon. I told her I would go get her some ice-cream.

I went to the kitchen and bawled my eyes out and still as I type this. I was a robotic, monotone, and mildly autistic person my whole life so being vulnerable is difficult for me. I don't even know why I'm typing this, I guess I just want to hear what everyone has to say and maybe hear some relevant experiences.","You are a loving granddaughter who is doing the very best for your grandma. Wishing you strength and moments of peace in between your daily struggles with her.
I'm sorry for your loss.  Mourning is not uniform and need not wait for physical death.  Just continue to be kind the best you can and remember the good days.  Chances are you will still get some more lucid moments.  My mom will often parrot back ""love you.""  She usually remembers my name but rarely remembers that I am her son.  A few weeks back, she told one of my sisters ""I love you Connie.""  She hasn't called her by name in probably 1.5 to 2 years and only rarely sees her anymore.  I was really happy for my sister.
There's no doubt that this is hard.  


Many of us have already been there.  


I'm worth my father and I've had him slowly slip away in small increments like grains of sand.  
He's done all he could and it's up to me to be his caregiver and walk ""hand in hand"" with him to the end.   


  
He's going to be with me till for awhile longer as I've been repeatedly told I'm giving him excellent care by nurses, doctors and social workers.   
That's all fine and well, but the daily awareness of their condition and eventual passing any easier.   


Say EVERYTHING you need too, they're still in there and you might have some lucidity bubble up and you'll see it in their eyes.    When really gets me is when I was talking to him one night about all my fears and the issues I've had to face and the loss of family only to have him reach his hand out, look me in the eyes and tell me... ""It'll be alright...""  


He can't speak anymore other than exhaled ""yeah"" and maybe some other words.  
but he's in there and doing his best he can and I still talk to him and keep him involved in things.  (important!)   


I'm sorry as the roles have haven flipped on you.  
You're now the parent and they're the child that is in need of help.  


All of this is do-able and you can and will get through it all.  


Not saying it's easy but it's a test of character and it's her being in your life that makes it all possible for you to keep going and... 

*Keep fighting the good fight.*
I’m so sorry. It’s so hard watching someone slip away. They even begin to look different and not just from aging. I do the same thing you do and say, “hey remember when ____” and I’ll get the same nod, which is comforting but I can tell there is no memory. I hope my joy when I am relating the memory brings my dad some joy in the moment.
I'm sorry for your sadness.  But I'm glad you had a good grandma.
I’m so so *sooooo* sorry.  Dementia blows

Yeah that day came 5 1/2 years ago (summer 2016) for me when my dad took mom to Florida for a getaway. She was already at stage 6 Alzheimer's. When she came back (January 2017) she wasn't the same person anymore and definitely reached stage 7 at that point. Her affect was completely gone and could no longer speak coherently. She was a total cognitive mess that point forward and it only got much worse from then on. Today, she is 87 years old and completely immobile, hardly speaks, remembers nothing and only repeats a few incoherent phrases, barely eats mostly baby food and ensure, and has been confined to a bed for over 15 months now.",2022-02-05 00:06:14,_Unpopular_Person_,skyrzx
Alzheimers,Suspecting Alzheimers in parent,"Hello all, I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post. Would appreciate a redirection if so. 

I’m a bit concerned for my mother, 57, but I’m not sure if if my concern is misplaced. I don’t live near her, I’ve come to town for a visit. I’ve only spent a couple hours with her so far.  

1. I asked if she could take me to a dental appointment (I know, weird because I’m visiting, long story). I asked her this over text, she understood, she used the phrase dental appointment. She picked me up, but when she arrived she was shocked to be driving to the dentist, she genuinely thought I was heading to an interview. 

2. I asked her to remind me of my sisters street address, she couldn’t remember the street name. She was absolutely distraught that she couldn’t remember. She seemed like she was about to cry. 

3. She said, spontaneously, sometimes she tries to think and it’s like there’s some block. She can’t remember things or understand things. And again, seemed distraught. 

4. She misremembered a conversation we had, but at the time she did not seem confused. She asked if I had my own car insurance, I told her I did. Two days later, she tells me she’s concerned because, she found out I’m not on their insurance, when I had, according to her, told her I was. 

Now, she’s been sending rambling scatterbrained texts for some time. But I assumed that was just a ‘boomer using technology’ thing (sorry if this offends). But after these 4 events that, again, occurred just in the past couple days over a few hours, I’m deeply suspicious there’s something going on. Is this enough to insist on a trip to a neurologist? I’m not sure I trust her to remember to bring it up with family doctor.","What is commonly done in this situation is to alert the family doctor to your concerns, by letter, email, or phone call.  If they think something merits it, they'll send her to a neurologist or a geriatrics doctor.  Ask her when her last checkup was, and if it's not recent, insist she make an appointment.  Just for ""general health.""  

There are a number of reversible conditions (thyroid, vitamin deficiency, depression) that can mimic dementia, so it's really important to get it checked out.
Sounds like you absolutely should! Better safe than sorry.
Do you know if her mum had Alzheimer’s or dementia?
I would definitely suggest to her that she should see a doctor. You've said that's she's aware of these blocks herself, that's really good because it means that she knows something's wrong so it should be easier to persuade her to get it checked out.

Now is exactly the time to get it seen to. Maybe it's just the menopause or some sort of deficiency but maybe it's a sign of something more. My mum was around the same age when she was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's and it wasn't until we saw her do one of the cognitive tests that we  realised how bad she actually was.",2022-02-04 20:08:55,JS_throw25,sku1k0
Alzheimers,How to deal with being annoyed,"My grandmother has Alzheimer’s and I live with her and my mother. In the begging I though it would be the sad story we know regarding the disease. She would forget everything and everyone and it would be really painful. But thank god she didn’t forget everybody, but she forgets everything and asks the same thing over and over again and it is driving me crazy! She doesn’t like to do anything! We try so hard to make her do any activity so she at least exercise her brain. Activities like painting, reading, playing games, watching tv but she does it for some minutes and stop and choose to look at the wall and DO NOTHING! And she asks the same thing more than 10 times in less than 3 minutes. I don’t know what to do. I love her so much but every time she starts to ask the same thing repeatedly I get really annoyed and I feel bad for that. I don’t want to be mad at her or be rude to her. I know it’s not her fault she can’t remember things but it is in fact extremely annoying. Do you have any advices on how to not get annoyed by it and what can I do to make her do something, like what activities do you guys recommend?","Sometimes I’ve found answering a question with “I don’t know” and shrugging works. If they don’t know they answer, they often accept that I don’t know the answer either. 
I also think that it’s okay for her to not do stuff if she doesn’t want to. I know you are trying your best and have the best of intentions, but “exercising her brain” is not going to fix this awful disease. If she’s not upset staring at the wall, let her stare at the wall and appreciate the peace.
with the repeated Q&A, it helps to just answer with the shortest and simplest answer possible instead of explaining details each time.

also consider getting an evaluation for hearing aids. If she has unaddressed hearing loss, she may not be hearing it fully each time you say it and just nods. 

activities: knitting, coloring books, folding clean laundry, clipping coupons, watering flowers.
Stick to simple, concise answers as much as you can. Not only will she understand them better, it'll be less frustrating for you to repeat it if it's just a single sentence. 

She doesn't know she's repeating herself. As far as she's concerned, she's asking these things for the first time so you just have to treat it like that. There's no point in getting frustrated.

As for the activities, there's really no reason to be forcing her to do anything. She may very well be struggling with things that were once easy for her, so they may tire her out more than you're used to or she may become sad that she can't do them or become engrossed in them as easily as she could before. If she can only manage a few minutes of something, that's fine. And when she's just staring at the wall, she's probably not just staring at a wall the same way you or I might, she's probably thinking about things or reflecting on things, even if she can't communicate this with you. If she's happy enough doing it, just let her be.

I know how instinctive the urge can be to try to get her to do something to help her memory, like doing certain activities, but honestly there's nothing you can do. If she has Alzheimer's, it's a fact that unfortunately it is only going to get worse and no amount of brain training exercises or stimulating activities is going to stop it or fix it. You just have to meet them where they are. 

If she's happy only doing something for a small amount of time, that's fine. At least for that little while, she was happy. And if she's happy to sit peacefully then that's also fine. The key point is that she's happy.

Trust me, I know how infuriating it can be but the time will come when you look back at this stage and wonder what you were worried about, because things are going to get much harder. When you feel yourself getting frustrated, just take a moment to breath and slow down. She's running at a different speed than you are. All you can do is meet her where she is. Focus on the good things. She still knows who you are and can still spend quality time together. These things won't last forever, so cherish them while you still can.
I second folding laundry...get some wash cloths since those are easy. What about music, exercising, simple picture books(they have some on Amazon...Cats in Costumes and Dogs in Costumes).
I'd take my grandma for a short walk to the front porch or to the end of the driveway and have her tell me a heartwarming story. Also asked her to sing me nursery rhymes. Worked most of the time.

Sometimes staring at the wall is what's needed in the moment. 

As long as grandma was safe and loved, everything else was just noise.

Wishing you gentle moments.",2022-02-04 16:50:09,Interesting_Life_422,skpdqp
Alzheimers,Things I Wasn’t Prepared For - A One Year Retrospective on Caring For My Mom with Early-Onset Alzheimer's,"Today marks one whole year since I quietly moved my mom in with me, a literal blink of an eye decision after her third doctor’s appointment as we were starting to explore her cognitive decline at the end of 2020. An appointment where I had been given the response to a decision that I had been needing to make, but knew that no one but myself would actually be able to make that decision; the response given by her new doctor to me with nothing more than a firm, but sympathetic look in the eye. It was truly unspoken. My life has changed dramatically fast this past year, and I’m honestly still spinning in a daze of surreality and grief. Some things I’d like to share that I was in no way prepared for when starting on the last journey that I ever expected, nor would I have ever wanted to be on:


The way she has become fixated with things like constantly pulling her socks up to her knees or pulling her shirt down over her knees while she’s sitting. Or when she’s not pulling her socks up as high as she can, she’s taking them off and wearing them on her hands like a sock puppet. Or how she constantly has to hold the shirt or jacket she's wearing from the bottom like she's carrying a security blanket when we're out and about.


The way she started sucking on her fingers and how that turned into full on thumb sucking for comfort just in the past couple of months and weeks. Or just how talking to her in general sounds and feels like dealing with a child. Coming from someone who loves and is really good with children, having to treat your mother like a child, and being in a ""child has become the parent"" scenario is brutal beyond belief. I have no one to take care of me the way a mother should anymore, and I supremely envy those who still have perfectly self sufficient and capable parents.


The way I have to take things away from her, like the cap to a drinkable yogurt bottle, so that she doesn’t put things that don't belong in her mouth.


The way she has become so possessive. If I pick up or move anything, even if it’s so simple as taking her clothes out of her dresser to get her dressed for the day, “that’s mine!”


The way I have to plan my entire day around her, and the fact that she now has a strict 8:30 pm bedtime that I enforce religiously just so I can have some time to myself before I need to go to sleep. Or the way I truly feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day for things she needs, I need, or someone else needs. Or the way she showers once a week now, because I do not have the energy to do more than that, and she doesn't want to. I’m lucky if I can shower every other day. Or the way I have had to decline opportunities to do fun things with friends because I have to be mindful of her needs or the fact I don’t have anyone who can watch her for me, and she can't be left alone. 


The way I’ve made decisions on her behalf in general, like her bedtime, not being able to drive or work anymore, taking her phone away from her, selling her car, donating things we have no room for that she's had forever but doesn't need, and the way she resented me for every bit of it at the beginning as if I had completely betrayed her. 


The way I basically have to carry a diaper bag and a change of clothes for us to go somewhere for the day.


The way I constantly have to repeat myself for something as simple as directing her take off her shoes when we get home, or telling her to put her shoes on, but she’s got one on her foot and her hand in the other. Or how when I’m getting her dressed and say “put your leg in,” I’m constantly having to try to get her to understand that usually the leg I need her to put in, is not the one she has already put in. Or the way when I’m trying to get her to take off her pants to change her, it’s a good two or three or more attempts of her pulling them back up after I’ve pulled them down before I can actually get them off of her. Or how she’ll say “okay” in the most annoyed tone as if she’s already doing what I’m asking her to do, but hasn’t budged an inch.


The way I have had to put my hand in places and clean things I'd rather not.


The way that she will act as if something right in front of her is completely lost and out of sight. “Get in bed, please” or ""put your shoes on"" (that I have set right in front of her) becomes “I don’t know where it is.”


The way she will wander around the room moving things around for no reason, or does things like taking her clothes out of the dresser, or the drawers out of her nightstand, pictures out of frames, or pull the blankets up from the bottom of the bed while she's laying in it, for reasons completely unknown to her.


The way she blames everything she does (that she shouldn't be doing) on the unnamed figures she hallucinates in our home, because “they did it,” or “they told me to,” or the way she blames not having done something that she used to do with ease claiming that “no one ever told me.”


The way she’ll ask me where her parents are, and they’ve been dead for decades, or the way she calls me “mom” as if she genuinely means it. 


The way she throws a tantrum and can’t find her words like an exasperated two year old who hasn’t even learned all of their words yet. Or the anguish in her voice when she says things like ""I'd rather die,"" ""I'm going to die,"" etc., when I've asked her to stop doing something or when she is just genuinely upset for reasons unknown to both of us.


The way I read emails from daycare as if I were reading a progress report about a child. “She has a new friend named Sharon, who she is very compatible with.” Or, ""we need more diapers for her locker.""


The way that I have had to keep things in the kitchen out of reach to avoid things like cookies having bites taken out of them and being put back into the container, or a whole bunch of bananas bought the night before meant to last the week, demolished and consumed (or in that one case, half under her bed and the other half on top of the toilet tank) within 30 minutes like she’s never seen them before.


The way I had to childproof my deadbolt locks and door knobs to keep her inside and safe.


The way I got so emotional on the phone with the phone company representative and afterwards, over canceling her cell phone plan and losing the number she's had for 20 years because there's no point in keeping it if she doesn't know how to use her phone anymore, and she gets more spam calls and texts than anything else.


The way I thought friends of hers we would be able to count on, who said they would be around for her or at least call to check on and keep in touch with her, very quickly faded into oblivion as if they never existed and without a word, but occasionally will send the thoughts and well wishes that I have no use for. The unofficial goodbyes that she never got to have and were taken away from her while she still had the chance to have somewhat clear and concise conversations. She was and is so lonely. I hear ""no one likes me,"" ""no one wants me,"" ""I have no one,"" more often than I want to.


The way I miss my mommy, who is right in front of me nearly 24/7, but is a completely different person. The one person who I never wanted to imagine life without, and thought I'd have around as we both got older, but who I now pray for relief for and from, so that we are both at peace in different ways.


The way hugs became an act that make me cry instantly, because they’re not hugs from who I want them to be from. They’re lifeless, like I can truly feel the energy and bond we shared for so long between us is gone.


The way she tells me she likes me instead of she loves me. I was prepared for her to eventually forget me, but I was not prepared for it to happen as fast as it did, within 6 months of her moving in. Or the way she doesn’t associate me as being the little girl in our old family photos, that little girl is *her* shady-pines-ma. Or especially the way she knows who my cousin and her young children are, but not her own child. I know I was loved so much, I know how much the real her loves me, but it doesn't hurt any less.


The way I became someone who takes hours or days to respond to messages like it truly is the bare minimum I actually can do.


The way I came to understand the type of depression where you just don’t want to get out of bed for the day, where things that used to bring joy brought stress and felt like a chore, like decorating for holidays and seasons. Last year was the first year that I didn’t decorate for anything, and it made me so sad, but I couldn't do it. Or how I have no desire to do anything related to my less than two year old small business that I was so proud of and put so much work into, launching at the start of the pandemic no less. Or the way things that are actually chores that I had no trouble with maintaining a fairly regular schedule for became unbearably overwhelming; like dishes and laundry or mopping the kitchen floor.


The way that I have felt the anger and grief that quickly started to fill my mind, body, heart and soul faster than I could release it; like being trapped in falling sand in an hourglass, become something that makes me fear for my own physical health. Or the way that I have let words spit off of my tongue like hot venom with the intention to maim because I can’t hold them in, knowing full well it’s her Alzheimer’s I truly hate with a passion, not her, and the guilt I’ll forever carry that comes afterwards for not holding them in.


The way I have started to dread people asking me how I’m doing because I usually have nothing good, positive, or worthwhile to share. It’s always just a big pile of sadness. Or the way some people will ask how she’s doing, and not ask how I’m doing. It’s very contradictory, and I hate it.


The way I internally reject compliments or words of encouragement for taking care of her as if I really had a choice. I know I had a choice, but I also know that I don’t think I could have lived with myself if I chose to abandon her. And believe me, I contemplated it in the beginning. I feel like an indentured servant, and according to filial law, I kind of am.


The way that I feel like I haven't and will not have done my best at making the last memories my mom could retain, good ones, after everything she has ever done for me.


I wasn’t prepared for the long goodbye and I wasn't prepared for the different goodbyes to happen so soon.


If you read all of this, thanks. If you’re going through this or have gone through this, my heart goes out to you. If you’ve never gone through this, I truly, from the bottom of my heart hope you never have to. This is the cruelest existence I never thought I’d be living in, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.","As the 38 y.o. only child of a divorced mom with Alzheimer’s, I feel this in my bones. I’m so sorry.

My mom was diagnosed in September 2020 —which was as soon as I could get to her from NYC when I realized, over the summer, that something terrible was happening to her cognition when her texts became progressively more disjointed and childlike. We both have a copy of the APOE4 risk gene, but she’d been holding steady with very mild cognitive impairment (a flubbed word here and there, 27/30 on the MOCA) for years. Then the pandemic lockdown and our longest separation (December 2019-September 2020) and she plummeted off the cliff. Her MOCA score fell to 21/30 (my mom had been a brilliant engineer) and her verbal ability was even worse. She was ultimately diagnosed with the logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (losing language ahead of memory, though that’s awful now, too) caused by Alzheimer’s.

Leaving my husband (a professor of immunology at NYU who cannot work remotely) and moving back to rural Georgia wasn’t possible, so I’m providing long-distance care in tandem with my aunt (her healthy younger sister) who lives next door and provides in-person assistance. Because my mom also has borderline personality disorder and violently rejects assistance from me because she still sees me as her (young, inferior) child, my mom’s doctors and my own therapist convinced me, in spite of my guilt, that I shouldn’t be her primary caregiver, as having me in the role distresses her in a way other people don’t. 

For example, if I remind her to take a pill, she throws things at my head and starts screaming “YOU’RE MY MOTHER (she means daughter)!!! YOU DON’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!” But if my husband or someone else asks her, she cheerfully complies.

So, in order to preserve as much of the positive relationship between us as possible, I visit her for a week every 6-8 weeks and play daughter to her face while working with her bills, doctors, and my aunt behind the scenes, assessing where she is and what her needs are so we can secure outside care when her needs exceed my aunt’s capabilities.

I feel enormous guilt about not giving up my entire life to be her caregiver and I still question it. That said, when I look back on those first few months when I did attempt it, the distress and violence (from her) was unbearable. She simply couldn’t tolerate me behaving like the parent in any way, even in the simplest ways like preparing her food.

But not being her in-person caregiver fills me with guilt and anxieties that utterly consume me, even here in NYC. All day. Every day. Especially given how rapidly she’s declined in just two years — having already forgotten almost all my life history, my middle name, and my birthday. Having lost most nouns and substituting every few words with “thing”. Having lost all ability to comprehend bills or cook (thank goodness for meal deliveries and my aunt). Having lost the ability to understand many verbal commands or read beyond a first or second grade level (she used to read two books in a day).

I feel like she’s slipping through my fingers and I’m missing out on the last moments I’ll ever have with her as my mom (though she’s increasingly childlike, she still thinks of herself as my mom and treats me with the same affection she always did, even offering advice or help when she thinks I need it, which is bracingly bittersweet). 

At the same time, if I’m around for more than a week at a time (as over the holidays), she becomes progressively angry, blaming her confusion on me and raging sometimes for 8 hours straight to the point where neither of us can bear it.
My SO is about 3 years into her dementia from the first sign: a lose of the ability to evaluate homes we were shopping for. My job took us to Illinois and it was over so we were moving back to Pennsylvania. 

She is slowly losing skills and mental sharpness. She needs only a minimal amount of assistance in getting dressed. She helps make the bed in the morning, washes dishes in the evening and constantly misplaces items. 

My heartbreak is a slow, slow march toward senility. I am working to be a better cook, housekeeper, and using my limited social skills to help her navigate the changes. 

She stay by herself while I go to the local store to pick up the on-line grocery order. The next step is to take her along, then use direct delivery. 

At some point, I will need assistance. Likely, a few hours, several days a week, if just to keep my sanity. It's finding the balance, cost vs. usefulness.. 

It's a strange greiving process, with me greiving the gradual loss of my companion of 25 years..


I have made changes, like more night lights in the bathrooms, so she doesn't have issues. I leave a few sheets of toilet paper hanging down so it's easier to find. getting her to eat, and take medicine is a struggle. 

Your mom's going downhill much faster, it seems a much harder job. Try getting a professional caregiver for one day a week. If just to let you get some rest.
It IS the longest goodbye.  Sending hugs.
Fuck this hits me so  hard. Almost 2 years in living with my mom. I'm literally crying in the corner of the bar reading this. I drew the short straw and I hate it so much. I don't like this zombie that is not my mom :( I just wish she could have peace and the whole family. And ya the worst is when NO ONE asks me how I am but always asks how she is.! Uggg
Oh

Oh my

I wish I could come to you and hug you and give you strength.  My mom was diagnosed with early onset at 58 years of age but this was after approximately 5 years of symptoms my dad and I tracked and searched for answers.  

She passed at age 72 in 2018 and I'll be blunt and say her passing was a blessing, she would have been furious at being trapped in her body while her mind betrayed her.

My dad was her true companion and hero, and I tried to be there for him and her.  We both lived through what you described where friends who told him to always call if he needs something, fell right off the face of the earth, only to come back after she passed.  We didn't have the energy to be angry, hurt for sure...but anger takes too much fuel and we had to use it elsewhere.  My siblings response was shocking and very disappointing.

I cried reading your post and I understand.  There are many people who do but sometimes they're difficult to find because the understanding is invisible. Reach out, the right people are there.

Hugs to you and to your mom...so many hugs.
Join a caregiver support group.  You'd be surprised how helpful it can be, both in understanding the disease, and in feeling better about your role and your life in general.
I know exactly what you are going through but it has been six years with my wife. The only help I had who was a good friend died to years ago.

There are some laughs like when she tried to feed a Milkbone to her stuffed dog or when she put her plate on the sofa and I look up and she and the cat are eating out of the plate. I just went back to reading. One night about three she stood up out of bed and shouted ""time to get up.""(she almost non verbal). My daughter said she had heard that a thousand times.
I felt every word of this 

Bless you and your Mom
Oh Jesus, all of this is so relatable. I feel like I could have written this. I'd say my heart goes out to you but we all know how it feels and how useless words are.

The only thing that's different is that my mum's progression started off a little slower, she was diagnosed in 2016 and moved in with her sister (because she had lived in the countryside and obviously couldn't continue to drive anymore so this was the most sensible option), but she was still herself, right up until 2020. Until then she had just been losing small things, like the initiative for conversation, forgetting words, not being able to cook for herself etc but she was still very much her and didn't need too much looking after. But in 2020 it all started to go downhill, with me needing to stay with her any time my auntie was working (luckily I was on furlough) and then at the start of 2021, everything went to hell over the course of a few months. 

My husband and I moved in with my mum and my auntie in Feb 21 because we were made homeless (landlady decided she needed to move back in to her house and didn't give us enough notice, in the middle of winter and a pandemic) and it honestly worked really well at first. My auntie and I were able to share all of the caring responsibilities evenly, which gave us both a break when we needed it.

Then in March, mum completely flipped one day and became terrified of her sister. She couldn't stand to look at her or even know that she was in the same house, which meant that my auntie had to hide in her bedroom the entire time and sneak in and out of the house for work, and we had to sneak her meals through for her. 

By this point, mum was acting exactly as you described in your post. She was delirious, had hallucinations, was incapable of seeing what was right in front of her (including one absolutely horrendous morning where she was clearly desperate for the toilet but couldn't see that we were right beside it and all she had to do was pull her trousers down and sit on it, and would under no circumstances let me pull them down for her or maneuver her on to the toilet seat).

This lasted for a month, and was the catalyst for us finding a care home for her. She was far too stressed out being in the house so there was absolutely no benefit to her staying there anymore as opposed to a care home, in fact it was proving to be more stressful than a home would be.

That period was the worst of my life. No one can prepare you for what it feels like to grieve the person you are actively caring for. I'm no longer caring for her now that she's in the home, but all of those feelings are still there and I feel just as hollow and broken inside. I've lost my mum but still have to visit her each week, even though she gets nothing out of the visits since she doesn't recognise me from a stranger on the street and every time I see her it kills me just a little bit more.

One thing that makes me feel weird is when people tell me I'm so strong. Whenever they say that, all I can think is ""so fucking what?"". And what does that even mean? This is the situation we are in and I haven't killed myself yet. Does that make me strong? I'm not a fucking warrior, I'm just a person in a shitty situation, I don't really have a choice. Does hoping that my mum dies before this gets worse make me strong (which doesn't look likely because she's 64 and her physical health is still really good)? It doesn't fucking feel like it. Does planning my own suicide for if I ever begin to experience Alzheimer's make me strong? Because again, it doesn't fucking feel strong.

Thank you for sharing your experience. It's all too familiar. I'm not going to tell you to get some help, or that you don't have to do it alone, because you know all that already. Just make sure to check in with yourself though to recognise when too much is too much.
So much of this is comparable to my experience, I'm 6 years into it, so I have got somewhat used to many of the changes. Not being able to have time off or a moment alone never gets easier, it just compounds the stress and the feeling that you are treading water with your nose just breaking the surface. 

The only thing I can say is try not to get down about losing your temper. Memory problems are absolutely infuriating. Not being able to communicate, having to repeat yourself, a question being misunderstood, and then you get shouted at, them doing the exact opposite of what you ask or saying mean things about you for no reason at all, no one is immune to losing their shit when you suffer these things all day every day.

I haven't joined a support group yet, but I do worry that with me probably being the youngest, I might not benefit from the group or feel comfortable being in it.

Thanks for your story
Wow, you’ve so perfectly captured my family’s experience in this post. So many times we’ve been confronted with a new, frustrating symptom and felt like no one else was going through the same experience with their loved one because it was just so bizarre we thought it couldn’t possibly be normal for an Alzheimer’s patient. 

Thank you for posting this and putting words to feelings and experiences that I’m sure many of us have had but couldn’t bring ourselves to articulate. I’m sure this wasn’t easy to write and scary to be vulnerable in front of a bunch of strangers but you’ve helped at least one person today through that vulnerability and I am grateful.
Depression is common among caregivers.  Many of us see a therapist and find it helps.
I felt pretty much every line of this. I'm 6 months in to the same scenario. I feel like some of your words are my own. That 8:30 bedtime is so spot on. That leaves me an hour and a half to myself where most days I can't find the motivation to do much of anything. I feel for you. There are literally no words of comfort anyone can offer right now but you already know that. I hope you find peace here and there to get you through.
I am sending you endless love and hugs!!!💗💗💗This is not the kind of experience we were prepared for but that is also our shortcoming as a society. Thank you for sharing your story. Btw, I am researching dementia these days and from the papers I have read, caregivers of dementia tend to develop depressive symptoms. As hard as it is for you, I urge you to undertake measures for self care, accept compliments and make time for yourself. Again, loads of love, wishes and strength your way!!
This hits allll the feels.  I’m so sorry for your pain & frustration. It truly is the cruelest disease. It never follows the same path for the afflicted.  There are generalities of course but it’s always different which is hard to wrap one’s head around.
>The way I have started to dread people asking me how I’m doing because I usually have nothing good, positive, or worthwhile to share. It’s always just a big pile of sadness. Or the way some people will ask how she’s doing, and not ask how I’m doing. It’s very contradictory, and I hate it.

People would ask, knowing she had Alzheimers, and really, what the fuck did they expect me to say? She's good? She's doing great. She's on a roll. She's dieing infront of me, there's nothing I can do but watch and suffer the trauma it will have on me, thanks for asking and bringing it up. I know they mean well but get a damn clue.

&#x200B;

>like being trapped in falling sand in an hourglass

I had so many days like that. So, many. Could not get ahead. Things just got worse. Days that kept going. Emergency nights where I'd have to rush over to her house in the middle of the night because, I'm it, I'm the only one able to. Things and events, continued to pile on, having to ignore processing the events because I didn't have the energy.

I'm sorry you're going through this. I've been there. It's very difficult. If you're able to get respite, take it, and have YOU time. When the Dr thinks hospice is a possibility, take it. You will only know how much they help once they do. Review hospice places before making a decision. It can't be easy having started a business at the start of the pandemic, meanwhile your second job is also there (Taking care of mom). It sounds like you're on the right path though. It's going to get tougher, but it seems like you're doing just as good as about any of us. Best of luck to you.
I miss my mom so much. Today when I went to visit her at the memory care facility I asked her if I could lay my head in her lap. She obliged and when I laid my head down…her pants smelled so badly from an accident she’d had earlier that even with a mask on and even with how badly I just wanted comfort (even though it wasn’t real) - I couldn’t stomach it.  And I just miss being loved unconditionally and having that person in the world who adored me. Your post brought me to tears because it’s absolutely everything I feel and miss and hate about this horrible ending. This sucks and I’m so sorry.
Oh my god. My mom(who’s been physically ill for last 15 years and had to use a walker starting in 2012) has a security pillow case.. she’s had one for atleast 10 years.. i have tears in my eyes im realizing this disease started in her early 60s, not this last July
I can imagine. Im 34, I care for my 67yo father and I'm his only child, most of my and his relatives are older, my job can barely support me and a caregiver while I'm at work. Quitting would mean more financial stress and my main familial financial help-my aunt, his younger sister is set to retire in January 2023. There are days he doesn't remember me, the man who lived his life for me; he is easily frustrated; he can still use the bathroom on his own but he makes mistakes like poo on a stone cutting board and hiding it under his bed. It's been a quick decline from his september 2019 diagnosis but if I guess right, signs were there from 2-4 years before.

I recently lost a pregnancy, better paying jobs are in the capital in my country but alas, I have no transport and most of my free income goes into the house and his medications- prostate cancer along with alzheimers. Relationships are tricky and most if my time is spent trying to calm him down, fix things he dismantled as he thinks he is still handy, put things in their right place and just general daddy sitting. I don't know how I manage, but I'm not strong. I just survive",2022-02-04 12:14:27,shady-pines-ma,skipgt
Alzheimers,My mother has started having auditory hallucinations and I'm terrified.,"Apologies if this ends up being a huge wall of text, but I've recently been facing the reality that something serious is going on with my mom.. and I just need to vent and get this off my chest. She's 70 years old and in decent health and I can't say for certain what exactly is wrong with her, but I'm fearing the worst.

I was at dinner with my parents the other night, and she mentioned that she was having trouble sleeping because there's man in the next door apartment that's been yelling and screaming. My mom has always been sensitive/annoyed to sound disturbances (some very valid, others perhaps a bit exaggerated) - so initially nothing seemed too out of the norm. But then my dad said he wasn't hearing these things (to which my mom offhandedly commented that my dad was just ""deaf""). He said they used a phone to try and record the sound - I listened to the recording and couldn't hear anything. She then went on to talk about how it was actually a man that was arguing with/abusing a woman. Apparently, she went down to the front desk and spoke with the super to complain, and they told her that he lived alone. She's now saying that the man is ""making up a woman's voice"" because he's crazy. When I ask her why we can't hear anything in the phone recording, she says ""well the sound isn't coming through the walls"" - and then when we counter with ""well if the sound isn't coming through the walls, how can you hear it?"".. she just, sort of avoids the question? Just repeats that ""this guy is totally psycho."" It's like logic isn't working at all on her. I spoke with my dad the next day to honestly ask what he thinks (he is a very logical, smart guy with a good head on his shoulders), and he confirmed she is experiencing auditory hallucinations.

My dad also told me she has started double locking the door to the apartment because she's afraid he might break in. It's horrible to know she actually is in fear.

She completely believes these hallucinations are real (which I understand), and at even the slight suggestion they might not be, she completely shuts us down. I asked her ""when was the last time you spoke with a therapist?"" (she has a history of depression) and she said ""don't even go there"" - as she knew what I was implying.

Before continuing, I do want to say we have reached out to her doctor. The doctor is planning to give her a call which my mom surprisingly seems receptive to. I suppose what happens after that conversation remains to be seen.

What concerns me beyond this is other little cognitive/personality changes I've noticed creeping up the past few years. My dad also mentioned a few things he's been noticing as well.

The big thing I've noticed, is having a conversation with her is sometimes a bit odd and difficult. She changes the subject frequently, interrupts us in the middle of talking (to yet again change the subject) - and sometimes we have to ask her a question multiple times before she answers (she'll respond to the question by sort of repeating things she recently said, but EVENTUALLY will answer). For example - my dad said he asked her when her doctor's appointment was. He had to repeat himself a few times because initially she wasn't giving him a direct response. But after a few times of my dad asking very directly, she was able to tell him. She didn't *forget* the date, but it's as though we had to get her to *really* focus on what we were asking, as though she wasn't paying attention. It's almost as though she just can't hold her focus on a single train of thought for long. Or she's talking and not really paying attention to us sometimes. It's almost like you can sense some sort of agitation and restlessness from her. She constantly has to get up to do things like she can't sit still. She's never been a particularly patient person, and has always been a big talker, but this lack of ability to focus during conversations is definitely out of the norm.

She's always been a light sleeper but my dad says it seems like she's waking up a lot during the night. He says when he gets up to use the bathroom he'll see her glued to her phone. She recently sent me a text at 3am to confirm dinner plans.

She seems to have lost a bit of her social filter. Like she doesn't grasp certain social tact and norms. My mom has always been eccentric, a big personality, chatty brooklyn gal that people sometimes find abrasive - but my dad said when they go on her walks she goes up to strangers multiple times to make small talk. She's always very nice (she's never rude or weird), but it's odd and not really in line with NYC social etiquette. We went out to dinner once and she decided to strike up a conversation with the people at the table next to us. These are things she used to not do because she understood that isn't really appropriate.

My dad said she's becoming very aggressive in her driving, to the point he refuses to ride as a passenger with her anymore. Again, she's a brooklyn gal and has always been one to honk, sometimes flip the bird or mutter profanities. But my dad said recently a guy cut her off, and she followed him for a bit just to pull up next to him so she could roll down the window and scream at him. That's very extreme for her.

My dad says that when they watch TV together she's often on her phone and will ask him to explain what's going on in the plot. I don't think it's because she can't *comprehend* what's happening, but she's on her phone because she just cannot concentrate for long periods of time, so she misses what's happening in the TV show.

Nothing really stands out in terms of dramatic memory loss, but she does like to have the same topics of conversation when I see her (which is about every 2 weeks), and will repeat things she's told me before. Not within the same evening, but she'll say things like ""You know your uncle is coming for passover"" (and she's told me this the last few times I saw her). Maybe she feels like she needs to remind me. Or she'll tell me stories she's told me before, show me things I've already seen. And I can't tell if it's because she's *actually* forgotten she's done these things, or if it's just things she likes talking about and is excited when she shares them with me. She's been really fixated on her father's death (he passed away decades ago) and the circumstances surrounding it (he didn't want to see her as he was dying) and it's almost like she's processing this grief all over again. I got a random text from her out of the blue that said ""your grandfather took his own life because he couldn't stand the pain."" (Which she has told me multiple times).

But she's still capable and independent. She recently read a book I got her. She uses photoshop on her computer. She drives to her studio each day to make art. She still posts on social media, uses her e-mail, her phone and can have conversations about complex topics (even if she can't stay on the subject for long). She still has passion and hobbies and things she enjoys doing. She can whip up a good cheese plate. She seems in good spirits when I see her, although sometimes she can get easily agitated.

All of these little things have had me suspicious and unsure for awhile (like, is she just getting old?), but the auditory hallucinations feel like the final nail in the coffin. Her mother had vascular dementia and I've read conflicting information if there's a genetic link. One of my biggest fears has been my mom getting alzheimer's or dementia, and I'm in shock that it actually might be happening.

I'm worried I just won't be able to keep it together around her. That eventually I might break down in front of her and upset her. The idea of having to stay strong for someone who forgets who you are seems impossible. I'm afraid one day maybe she'll get so angry she'll say horrible things to me. I worry that she might eventually understand what's happening to her and become terrified. I worry maybe she'll refuse to accept what's happening, will refuse to accept my help and refuse to accept the care she needs.

I know I'm probably getting ahead of myself and need to wait on what the doctor says, but I can't help feeling like I need to start preparing myself emotionally. Sorry - this definitely turned out to be a bit of a novel.","Don't worry about the hallucinations.  It's not uncommon with dementia.

She should be assessed by a geriatrics clinic.  I suspect  she needs to give up driving.

A therapist might be useful for her, but you could probably benefit from that  yourself.  I see someone once a month, and also go to a monthly support group.
Some of these things *could* be indicative of dementia, but honestly, what you are describing does not sound like dementia to me, but perhaps another type of mental health issue. Only a doctor can say.

For context, what we've experienced over time with my mother who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, was much more the classic progression of memory issues.

- She started having difficulty keeping up with her finances. Forgetting to pay bills, paying them twice because she forgot she paid them already, ordering things she already had, then not knowing where her money would go. Etc.

- issues with short term memory. Forgetting what day/year it was, what state she was in, whether she had eaten or not, forgetting recent conversations or events. Asking the same questions or telling the same story over and over.

- hygiene issues. Things like not bathing or brushing her teeth for days. When we would bring it up she would insist she had just taken a shower or brushed her teeth.

- forgetting what to do or how to operate during normal daily activities like using a computer, her phone, using the tv remote, the microwave, etc.

She hid it well at first, but over time it became more and more obvious she was struggling.

Again, I am no doctor, but what you are describing sounds more like paranoia or another mental health concern.... Which is good, because it may be more treatable than dimentia.
This sounds a bit like late-onset schizophrenia honestly. Which would be better because there are treatments and it's not as deadly as Alzheimer's. The psychosis is typically less sever in older patients as well. A clinical professional would definitely know better though, hope she gets the help she needs!
By the time there are outward signs, there is often a lot of hidden dysfunction being coped with that you haven't uncovered yet / lurking just around the corner. So keep being curious, at least, and see what more you can uncover. Doctor visit seems like a good idea.

Good luck and God bless, your mom sounds like a sweet lady!
It might be worth getting her tested for a UTI, these become very common as we get older and are known to cause visual and auditory hallucinations. It may be completely unrelated but still worth ruling out.",2022-02-04 13:42:51,coffeeandloops,skkw5e
Alzheimers,Diet and Alzheimers,"How important is diet in mid-stage dementia/Alzheimers?

My uncle, 78, is firmly in the mid-stage of dementia/Alzheimers. My mom, 75, is his primary caretaker. Her biggest concern: that he’s not eating properly. Though he gets (and eats) meals on wheels usually twice a day, he also buys packages of cookies and chocolate. He’ll eat a whole package in a day or two.

I understand how important a good diet is when you’re young and healthy, but does eating this much sugar at this stage/condition in life have a huge negative effect?","We made sure our mom was in general getting nutrients but quite frankly her life with the disease sucked so bad that giving her a McDonald’s hamburger every other day was the least of our worries. The only thing we really were concerned about was her access to junk food because she’d forget she’d eaten and would eventually make herself feel sick. I believe my brother and partner eventually childproofed the fridge so she couldn’t do that.
It seems many with dementia crave sweets. Part of the reason is the ability to taste is diminished or lost. Sweet is the last to remain.  His cookies and cakes may be the only thing that he can really taste. As the disease progresses sweets are the only thing that many eat. My mother lived a long time on ice cream, mashed sweet potatoes and Ensure (and very little of those).
I think with this awful disease we need to prioritize quality of life over anything else. If he’s happy, that’s what matters. Also, he very well might be eating the whole package of cookies in a day because he doesn’t remember how many he’s already had. If mom concerned enough and is nearby, she could break the package of cookies into zip top bags with a few each and drop one off each time she visits.
I feel you. And not making light, it’s just all I’ve been dealing with too. I’m at the point of trying to find some humor in it. It feels like trying to keep sugar away from a little kid. 

My Mother will eat a gallon of ice cream a day with 3-4 Pepsi’s and make herself sick. Every day. So I don’t buy her any and she gets upset that she has nothing to eat or drink. She lives in a facility that prepares nutritious meals with good size portions. She eats 2/day. But her sweet tooth is out of control. She doesn’t remember or believe that she’s ingesting so much sugar outside normal meals. I try to stock her up with fruits and vegetables but they just sit there while the junk food disappears and she claims it was never there. 

Tonight she showed me that she needed food in her fridge and I pointed out the carrots and asked her why she hadn’t opened them. She said “oh yeah-I’ve seen those around somewhere.” 

Her friend in the facility told me yesterday that a lady had a birthday and her son brought her a cake. After celebrating in the common area my mom offered to carry the cake back to the lady’s room. Instead Mom just took it straight back to her own house. The lady had to knock and ask for her birthday cake back. My Mom apologized, walked the cake over to the right door and then looked down at it in her arms, licked her lips, said goodbye and went back to her house with the other lady’s birthday cake again…the lady ended up just giving my Mom half… 

I too am trying to be understanding. I can’t force her to learn impulse control at this point. It’s a learning curve. I’m working on substitutions and building better habits. I have figured out that she will down low sugar fruit cups if the ice cream is gone. That’s a start. I have figured out that if I get her nice gum she will chew that and it seems to stave off the sweet tooth. Any other hints would be appreciated.
My dad was obsessed with sweets early on. Managing his disease was already challenging enough, so I just let him order the sugar. Doctors recommend a Mediterranean diet, but that is so incredibly difficult to maintain for someone in this disease process. Now he’s in a facility and his meals are balanced for the most part. I wouldn’t stress about it, Alzheimer’s is a relentless bitch and a piece of salmon won’t save your family member.
Dr. Mary Newport would definitely say diet is related. If only I could get my father to eat better. It’s hard with a grown up kid. Big hugs.
My dad will be moving into a care facility at the end of the month and will probably be eating better than he has in a long time. He loves his sweets and Wendy's.

Main thing to keep an eye I'd say is other health issues that could arise. My dad needed 5 fillings recently.... guess the caregivers weren't brushing his teeth! Sigh...
My mom lost her sense of taste after a surgery 25 years ago.  Her sense of smell is now going. As a result she doesn’t eat very much & is becoming quite thin.  I try to get her to eat but she’ll (always) angrily respond with, “I don’t need the calories (she does), do I look skinny to you? (YES! FFS, yes!) 

It’s of great concern because she has osteoporosis that requires biannual injection. She’s becoming quite rigid in the way she holds her arms & torso & she takes shuffling steps. She does pound back Coke Zero tho (don’t get me started) which is about the sensation of carbonation. 

I guess this vent was a long way to say, as long as food is being eaten, you’ll have other hills to die on.  *BIG HUGS*
Sugar is bad, young or old.

I'm (m60) luckily 12 years younger than my wife (f72) who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

Diet is important. We eat well, and we are trying supplements which I've read can/may help alleviate symptoms.

We also walk quite a bit.

The only downside is she is restricted to about 1 glass of wine a day.",2022-02-03 21:10:43,Sturnella2017,sk1dgs
Alzheimers,What to have on them if they get lost? So far considering a lanyard badge with contact info and an airtag.,"Does anyone have a getting lost plan? It happened to a loved one recently and never want to experience that again.

So far considering a laniard badge and an airtag tracker.","We use a RoadID on my mom’s Apple Watch, and the Apple Watch itself is hooked up to my dad’s Find Friends. Not totally sure how he did that. 
The RoadIDs are useful. I wear one on my watch too- it’s nice if I’m out running or something similar and don’t have room for an ID. And my mom doesn’t know she has one on her watch at all.
My husband (77 mid stage Alz) always always has his wallet on him. I tucked an Apple AirTag down in a corner of an inside pocket of his wallet and secured with a drop of glue. He hasn’t noticed it yet and that’s been several months ago. I can track him using the Apple FindMy ap on my iPhone or on my iCloud page. Our children with iPhones can track him also.
We used something called iTraq that could be tracked with the app. It was really affordable and pretty good at getting a general idea of where the tracker was. You could also set boundaries that would notify you if those boundaries are crossed
Old school solution could include sewing a fabric with their name and your phone number into their clothes, so you dont have to worry about them taking off accessories unfamiliar to them. Like where shirt and pants tags go, stuff like that. 

Theres medic alert style jewelry and watches, some with subscription plans, but sometimes they will get fussy and keep taking them off or destroying them.
We had an airtag converted to a bracelet for my grandmother. Before Alzheimer she never liked to be outside so it's an advantage and the airtag is just as prevention, but I've noticed how it has a delay on refreshing the location so I don't strongly recommend it because of that.
I got My ID for my mom. Not only did it have contact info but also all of her meds and diagnosis. There’s both an 800 number to call and a QR code. https://shop.getmyid.com/collections/myid-products?gclid=Cj0KCQiAuvOPBhDXARIsAKzLQ8H-IN3hOqJRsoWzFh7QqV6HA-mdlCdm2_vmitAAXVBrnuAlAOqtcP0aAkmYEALw_wcB
We used a multi-pronged approach. 1-hand out a flyer with a pic and your phone number to everyone one on the block. 2-drop off one of the flyers at your local police department 3-medical ID bracelet with Alzheimer’s diagnosis and home address and your umber 4-iron on labels for clothes with name and your phone number 5-set up cameras inside and outside the house that you can access remotely like Wyze.
Used medic alert also got one for me too as primary care giver if I went down needed to make sure someone knew.",2022-02-03 18:29:38,WallabyUpstairs1496,sjxu74
Alzheimers,Middle aged woman needs something to do,"My wife has been diagnosed with early onset (PCA) and can no longer drive. Her symptoms are still fairly mild, I think, but the problem is she’s stuck at home while I work and basically sits on the couch listening to NPR and dwells on not being able to do anything. She does laundry and dishes but has nothing to stimulate her mind once those are done. She’s never been an artist so she doesn’t want to draw or anything like that. Does anyone have any suggestions for us that may be helpful?

Update: I really appreciate all the responses. We will probably explore volunteering at the senior center or animal shelter. I also plan to get her an Apple Watch so she can walk around the neighborhood and I can see where she is.","Visit your local library and find her some books to read.   
Find a local charity that could use some help, maybe they have some tasks she can do at home.    
Check with your local elementary school and see if the teachers have projects she can do for them at home. When my son was in school I used to volunteer at the school and the teachers had so many things that need to be cut out or assembled. I set up a process with a few of the teachers where they would put work for me in a bin with instructions and I would pick it up and return it when I completed it (they also let me know when the day they needed it returned).
Crosswords, puzzle books, puzzles, scrap booking, knitting, cross stitch. Video game console.
Would she want to colour? It doesn't require skill or anything and mum found it soothing. Maybe she could journal too? Might be cathartic for her too.
Similar here except we are both retired and I'm home all day.  My wife does read a lot (not sure how, since her memory is about 30 seconds) but that and some TV that doesn't require continuity seems to work for her. Instead of NPR, it is local news & a favorite game show.  

We haven't gotten to investigate ""adult daycare"" yet, but that is coming probably within the year.  But you might contact your local university to see of they have care groups (for you) that can put you in a community that has local answers and resources. 

Finally, if you haven't experienced it already, one of the seemingly common problems, and a *big* one here, is that people with AD seem to be unable to deal with a TV remote pretty early on. I tried to simplify things by getting a Roku TV but apparently even that is too complicated.  Still, since the TV can be controlled by an Alexa, (Alexa, turn on..., tune to..., etc) maybe we can do that with a few written notes. I only mention it since you may want to investigate vastly simplified tech now.
Could she handle spending a few hours at the local senior center each weekday? There’s usually card games, movie screenings, exercise classes, lunches, etc. She would need to not be a wander-risk and independent with all toileting, mobility, etc.
Neurologists have told me that physical exercise is the most important. Does your wife like running? Do you guys have a dog? I’ve also found that socialization has been key for my father (he massively deteriorated in covid) to stay mentally active. Talking to people requires a lot of thinking. We take it for granted actually.
Perhaps your municipality's parks and rec department has an Adult Day Care (more intense care) or ""Senior Club"" program. 

Would you consider adopting a cat? If you are able to take on the administrative tasks (annual vet appointments, noticing you're out of food and order more, scoop litter daily, etc.), then she might find that playing with a cat and watching it do silly things throughout the day, could give her the right balance of engagement without being too dependent on her fulfilling duties she can't handle. A senior cat would be already trained and not need a ton of activity to be stimulated. **However, only get a cat if it's a responsibility you're willing to take on**, whether or not your wife could reap the extracurriculars. 

Cats are also fun because they offer an opportunity for her to work on ""projects"" like sewing toys etc to improve the cat's life. Although she could accomplish the same thing working on knitting small pieces for her nieces/nephews. Even if her plans don't ever come to fruition, her brain needs to stay engaged like training a muscle. Similarly, ""planning"" a facelift/remodel of somewhere in the house could be fun. Flipping through magazines and catalogs, tearing out pages, and sticking them in a folder. Basically, let her brainstorm the entire fun part.

Can she go for a walk in the immediate area? Daylight and exercise are really helpful to stave off progression.
Adult paint by numbers—there are some really pretty ones available online—and she wasn’t interested in drawing or art but loves to watch the picture take shape.  Jigsaw puzzles.  Word searches.  These three things (along with some tv) keep my mom occupied in between meals and naps. She also enjoys the radio/music while painting.
She could get medical rides to an adult day care or a senior center.  She would probably love the social contact, and they have all kinds of activities.  Look into something like that.
Lots of great ideas here. I would suggest volunteering generally, but specifically, what about walking and playing with dogs and cats at a shelter? Perhaps gardening when the weather improves? 

Is it possible she is depressed? It might be worthwhile to get her some counseling to explore developing some new coping skills now and to give her space to talk about the grief she might be experiencing since her diagnosis. Coun selingmight also help her identify some things she can still do and enjoy. Just a thought. An LPC, LCSW, LMFT would all be able to help.",2022-02-02 17:48:54,JHamilton36,sj2g5b

Alzheimers,How does everyone else deal with their anger regarding Alzheimer's?,"I'm just wondering (as the title suggests) how everyone else deals with their anger over this illness and the ongoing process of grieving a loved one who is still alive?

My mum's in a care home now and doesn't recognise any of her loved ones, even just as people she knows. She's not herself anymore. She's not my mum anymore. 

Even though I don't have the stress and responsibility of caring for her anymore, I'm finding that my mental health is quite probably the lowest it's ever been. Visiting her is taking a toll on me. I used to try weekly but after a succession of bad visits, I don't think I can keep that up any longer so I'm going to aim for visiting every 2 weeks. I feel awful about that, even though I know I shouldn't because it's important to keep myself mentally healthy, I can't help but feel guilty. 

Anyway, I've been feeling so much anger building up inside me, just at the unfairness of the whole damn thing (I know, I know, the world's not a fair place). My mum's so young, she's only 64, and I feel like I've missed out on getting to know her as an adult. She was diagnosed when I was in my early twenties and I feel like I've missed out on that crucial part of a parent/child relationship where you start getting to know them as an equal, as a fellow adult, rather than just ""mum"" or ""dad"".

I'm so, so angry and sad all the time, and I have no idea how to get on with normal, every day life whilst feeling like this. How does everyone else manage these feelings?","I may get down voted for this but some books by the Dalai Lama helped me. Meditation also helps. Been full time caretaker for my wife for 6 years now with very little help.
I had to get therapy
Very similar situation - age wise etc. I'm still primary caregiver. I'm starting therapy again (today!). In part because I have these overwhelming bouts of rage. And I'm bitter. And I'm sad.  Essentially i don't know how to deal with grief, and I hope the therapist helps with that.

I've told the wind ""I miss my mom"" so many times...
I cuss him out (out of earshot), call him stupid, etc.  I would feel guilty for saying these things, but nobody hears them except me, and I really do feel that way.  At times. 

And then when it's out of my system, I put on a smile and try to be a kind, patient caregiver.
Therapy and talking to friends helped.  Many times, when I left from visiting her, I would get in my car, drive away from where people could see me and then scream, yell, and cry all that anger out.  Then, I would treat myself to candy.
We have a similar history. My mom was 64 and I was 23 when she was diagnosed in 2020. I'm her primary caregiver until now, and I'm seeing the disease progressing faster in the last months... Seeing apathy growing everyday... It's for no one.
I completely feel this. I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm losing my dad (64) and this whole thing just sucks. I found one thing that really helped (bizarrely) was watching Rickie Gervais's 'Afterlife.' I processed so much in the final episode of season 3. A lot of people that I've talked to, who have lost parents, have told me that fiction is a balm for loss. Talking with friends, who have been in the same or similar situations has also helped. I think the early- onset part is such a hard part of it because you feel as though you've lost so much time with them. I caught up with a friend a few days ago who was lovely and who said that part of the problem with it is that it is such a lonely path. Between the two of us, we have maybe 5 friends who have lost a parent at our age. I have one other friend whose mum developed early-onset but she's in a different state of the grieving process now (she's in her 50s/ her mum is in her 70s). I think one thing I'm really trying to hold onto is not to lose my humanity in the process. The anger was shredding my soul but Dad wouldn't have wanted that. You sound like a wonderful person, you're angry because you care. X
Everything is temporary.
I am so sorry for what you are going through. It's a horrible disease and so hard on loved ones. You do need to have boundaries and do what works best for you at this point. I am going through this the second time around. My Dad passed away 5 yrs ago having early onset Alzheimer's and now my Mom was diagnosed with late onset in 2019. I am my Mom's ""person"", I help her with a lot even though we have home helpers as well. I am in therapy, I am learning to talk to open up about my feelings more and allow myself to sit with my grief to help me process it all. I do have bouts of screaming and swearing in my car. I don't like feeling sorry for myself but occasionally I just need to feel it. I think you just have to allow yourself some grace in all this.
Hi there. You are doing the best you can. It's normal to be angry when you're put in an unfair and sad situation. My partner feels a lot of anger at having to deal with this at an unexpected age/time in your life. She's having to mourn a lot of hopes and dreams.

I'm in the same situation as you expect my mom isn't in a home yet. My dad takes care of her. Like everyone else is saying, therapy was a must for me to be able to sort out my emotions. The early onset alzheimer's is such a different breed of grief. It is so slow burning that you have time to really feel every emotion on the spectrum for such extended periods of time. Naming my emotions and letting them each have their time rather than trying to get rid of them made me feel less overwhelmed by them. It's so normal to feel that anger, sadness, regret, guilt, frustration, and the list goes on. Know that you're not alone in this. Sometimes, if you feel an emotion taking over, I find it so therapeutic to write out everything I'm thinking and feeling no matter how dark. Then just delete it. It helps me get things off of my chest and process it and then deleting makes sure I'm not going to sit and stew on it and reread nonstop. These emotions probably won't be gone for a very long time. But they can fade or become more manageable with some attention.
I’m a totally different person now. I have zero faith now. No ways there’s a god that would do this. I’m pissed at my mom for dying 15 years ago and leaving me to deal with my dad. All good memories of my dad have been murdered by the “person” he has become. I can’t believe there isn’t a system in place to help these people die in peace instead of lingering for years as basically bags of meat. If you showed a person what would become of them in the future with alz, no one would say “oh yea, that looks delightful. Keep me alive at all costs”. And if I hear “it’s the disease, not the 
person” one more time, I’m going to scream! I feel like I’ve become a part time sociopath because I’m so numb inside. This is hell.
Therapy! Seriously helps me. I also get a lot out of mindfulness/breath work. I really enjoyed this book as well: [caring for a loved one with dementia ](https://www.amazon.com/Caring-Loved-One-Dementia-Mindfulness-Based/dp/1626251576)
I just take CBD gummies
I really feel this. I’m so sorry for all of us. Trying to wade through this is impossible.
I understand how you feel.  I took care of my mom and grieved her the whole time.  She went away at least 5 years before she died.  Is it possible when you visit her to just go in and let her know you are a friend that came to visit.  Part of the struggle is wanting to be recognized.  I know when I went with the flow with Mom and was whoever she cared to say I was it was much easier.  I could share a cup of coffee with her or maybe a bowl of ice cream.  Just talk about how good the ice cream taste and ad lib.  I would let her lead the conversation and try not to let my feelings be hurt that I was a stranger.  Neither of you can help it.  I have posted several times online if you are interested in reading any other comments I have made about my mom.  Hang in there.  I found out about an Alzheimer's support group thru the local chapter in my area.  It really helps to talk with others going thru the same thing.",2022-01-31 09:36:25,TubbyLittleTeaWitch,sh2o0r
Alzheimers,advice on speaking with my neighbor,"i’ve had a neighbor who lives in my building who has never been friendly, when i first introduced myself she purposefully ignored me. i continue to say hi and leave it at that when i see her, but she never says anything. the other day my partner and i discovered she has alzheimer’s or dementia, after an episode where we ended up having to contact our old neighbor, who is her daughter. obviously i don’t want to see this lady get hurt, or put herself in a dangerous situation, so if i notice anything i will continue to contact her daughter. however i’m curious if i just shouldn’t continue to say hello to her? i don’t want to scare her or confuse her further, but prior to this incident i just assumed she was rude or didn’t like me and i was just trying to be kind and approachable.","You and your partner sound like kind neighbors. I would still say hi to her, she might not think you're real. Many times hallucinations are common with dementia type diseases. So don't be alarmed if she doesn't say anything. 

 Seems crazy that her daughter isn't watching her more closely. Just be aware that this could cause a safety issue not only for her but for you as well. My grandmother set her apartment on fire a couple of times because she left things on or near the stove. THEN they put her in a facility. 

I am not sure what it would like for you to intervene...but maybe make sure your landlord is aware of the issue and that your renters insurance is in effect.
>so if i notice anything i will continue to contact her daughter. 

100% absolutely.  


There will come a time when they'll need to step into her life for her own safety.  
the only way they will know about this is to for you to call and let the children know.  


Also, contact social services in your city so that they're aware of an elder that needs some checking up on.   You can't leave them alone as they will quickly be unable to care for themselves, these conditions are insidious in what they do to a person.  


Also do it for your own self as it's always a risk for them to forget about having a stove left on and starting a fire that can burn the complex down.

Her daughter might have to have them live together to keep her safe or placed in a assisted living situation (not ideal)   


I understand that it's a persons first reaction to assume that someone with a condition is ""ignoring you"" but that's really not the case most of the time.   My father clammed up as he was aware of his impairment and while he was normally a VERY sociable person... he was afraid of tipping his hand as to his condition.   


He was afraid of letting others know or saying the wrong thing and embarrassing himself.  
So it was easier for him to pretend to not hear a person.  


But that lack of interaction only makes their condition worse.   


What you have to do is to gain trust.  


Then you'll see that there's a person there that isn't mean or rude, they're just **usually afraid and unsure.**  


They'll have memories of how they should interact but are now afraid to try as they're aware of their illness and how it impairs them.  So it's common for them to avoid people and interactions... *but it's one of the last things you want to allow to happen.*  


As it only makes their decline faster and their lives darker and more sorrowful.  


Seems like the family needs to step in a bit and for others to monitor her.
UPDATE: i was informed by my landlord that our neighbor moved. sounds like she went to be with family out of state, which is good because her behavior was starting to be very dangerous and extremely concerning! i hope she’s doing better now.",2022-01-31 10:19:13,tweaktweakin,sh3m83
Alzheimers,CBD for sleeping issues?,"Dad has been terrible with sleeping for the last year, my mom and sister are at their wits end because no one is sleeping anymore.  He is so restless and wants to go to the bathroom all night (he also wears a diaper constantly). He was diagnosed 6 years ago in his late 60s.  My sister was wondering if CBD oil made for sleep assistance would help.  Anyone try this?  We are trying to get him into hospice, but he is getting the run around from the VA.  They have tried melatonin gummies.  Any advice would be great!","I give my mom 5-10mg of melatonin and .50ml of a 1:3 THC/CBD tincture just before bedtime to help her sleep soundly. Without it she will wake up and wander around the house several times throughout the night.
CBD certainly makes me sleepy. It’s worth a try and safe to do so. Big hugs.
I had the same problem with my wife and Seroquile (sp) has been a life saver. Talk to his Doc.
The THC helps a lot! Highly recommend getting it if possible in your area.
Speaking from personal experience, I haven’t used just plain old cbd for sleeping. I’ve used edibles to help sleep, and those knock me out. I don’t know if weed is legal wherever you are, but something like that might be easier to get and cheaper than some type of cbd or thc supplement:) starting out with 5 mg would be a good place to start
I have my mom taking CBD oil, but she’s gotten used to it over time so it’s not as effective anymore. Worked great in the beginning and it still helps a bit. We are considering a THC/CBD 1:1 tincture for the “entourage effect” (meaning that the two compounds work best together as opposed to on their own). I certainly don’t see any harmful effects from it. Worth a shot!
Thanks everyone!  The 5mg is working great!  His sleeping is much improved.  You guys rock!",2022-01-30 05:44:30,migrater3,sg6mqf
Alzheimers,Questions about APOE2/4,"I have APOE2/4 genotype (https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Gs270) and I'm having trouble finding information on the risk of this genotype because APOE2 is rare and known to be very protective, but APOE4 is well known to increase risk of Alzheimer's. So what is the relative risk of the 2/4 genotype? Does one or the other dominate in this scenario? Is it unknown? I'd love to hear any research anyone has to share.

I know APOE genotype is just one risk factor. I am fit, healthy, don't drink or smoke, eat a relatively low sugar/low carb diet and get a lot of exercise. I'm not sure if any of my family would have gotten Alzheimer's because most of them died earlier in life from other factors (smoking, dangerous life, whatever).

The bad news is that you carry one copy of APOE4, which does place you at a higher risk for AD. 

The good news is that your risk can be dramatically reduced through a healthy [lifestyle](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.043228). In terms of risk reduction, leading a healthy lifestyle is more important for you than for those who do not have the APOE4 gene. 

So, focus on diet, exercise, quality sleep, mental health, stress management, continue to learn and challenge yourself intellectually, and build a quality social network!
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022214302000938 I did find this, but all it really tells me, if I'm understanding correctly, is ""both APOE2 and APOE4 have effects in APOE 2/4 individuals"".

Also, https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=APOE2%2F4&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DBuQTRuNpgp4J, which seems to indicate that APOE4 behavior ""dominates"" in more obese individuals

Alzheimers,Stage 7 Alzheimers and bedridden for over a year now.,"Has anyone had the experience of having a parent with Dementia/Alzheimer's become completely bedridden where they can no longer move their limbs? My mother started showing signs of dementia way back in 2006, and by late 2016 she was obviously at stage 7 (stage 6 about 3 years earlier). By 2018, I moved back home and quit my job, and lived on my savings and traded stocks on the side to care for her. Trying to preserve her estate while I'm the sole heir made more sense financially while I cared for her compared to paying outright for a memory are facility. Medicare and plan D supplemental insurance already covered the in home visits and care from nurses and her doctor. At this point she was wandering around the house in circles mumbling and completely oblivious to her own surrounding not even realizing she was in her own house.

At the end of that year she forgot who I was being her only son (44 years old at that point). Sometimes asking where I was when I was still at a baby age. She also asked for her own mom (my grandma) who passed away 40 years earlier. The following year was the worst, where she would have what seemed like schizophrenic episodes where she would get violently angry and scream at us, a housekeeper we had, and curse at furniture, throw stuff across the room or turn a room into a complete mess with old mail, house decor, magazines, etc., sometimes after 2-4am when everyone was long asleep.

This carried on for about 18 months until the end of October 2020 when she suddenly lost her balance and could no longer walk. She would swing around the bed and changing her diaper was painstakingly hard. After the summer of last year her limbs became almost completely paralyzed and her body has been mostly motionless ever since. Diaper changes obviously became much easier at that point. We got a hospital bed after bed sores became an issue, and they did heal with help from the nurse. She mostly mumbles and calls out for my dad and ginger ale (her favorite drink). She is fed with sippy cups, baby food squeeze packs, and Ensure blended with protein powder and meds. She is very frail at this point and bedridden for 15 months now at age 87. She gets swelling in her arms and her face is developing nasty sores.

We never thought she would make it to 2022 including her own doctor, yet here we are (she was put on hospice in early 2020 and recently taken off for outliving the time limit). Has anyone else dealt with a case this extreme? I can't imagine how much longer she can live like this, it's absolutely awful and I wish this on no one, but here I am watching my mom rot away ever so slowly. I did some online research and it seems 2 1/2 years is longest it goes on like this but that usually includes stage 7 dementia which for her started well over 5 years ago. The doctor and nurse both told me in early November last year she only has about 2-3 months to live. Now they won't even say. Can anyone else out there relate to this? My mom told me decades ago she never wanted to live like this, but now it's not her choice anymore.","I just want to say that you are an angel. Thank you for caring for your mom throughout her very worst time in this world.  I know she can’t tell you that, but I know that if she could, she would tell you thank you and that she is so proud of you.
I would just encourage you to get her signed back on hospice. Developing bedsores, losing more weight recently, these are reasons a hospice agency would re-qualify her. I’m very surprised they graduated her. You likely could find a different agency that would sign her back on. The benefit would be to ease the care burden just a bit, and to keep you aware of the signs of the end being in site, as you seem to need. They also will be able to know if it is time to stop feeding her (due to causing more harm than good) or when comfort meds are needed. Hospice nurses have seen this diagnosis and condition before. Yes, they some can live a very long time after becoming non-ambulatory. They tend to get more and more contracted and less verbal. Often the final cause of death can come in the form of a UTI or Pneumonia that would require IV antibiotics to cure, but have been opted out of given over all quality of life and prognosis. I would definitely get a hospice team back for both you and her to help guide this ending of her life.
I can't comment on the stages as MIL is late stage 6 so I  have no insights re: Stage 7. I am just  sorry to hear that you and your poor mom have struggled for so long. You really are an exemplary human being and such a loving son.
My mom is pushing over 10 years (2008-2009) as well and is slowly losing her ability to move her limbs. It's terrible. I can kind of relate. It takes 15 minutes to change a diaper to ensure that everything is fine alone, and more than one person to lift and carry. I certainly hope you're not doing this on your own.

Like the other post said, I'm pretty sure based on her current status she can requalify for hospice. You should call and ask Medicare.

I wish you the best of luck.
That sounds like such a tribulation.  Ironically, it's a result of very good care your mother has been given, including remaining in her home and having bed sores treated appropriately.  You are a *very good son*.

I wonder if she could have more comfort by receiving some gentle massage, especially in her limbs.  Do you think she has had some strokes?  That might have caused this paralysis.  

As for yourself, I'm sure you have developed some coping resources by now.  A dementia caregivers support group could help keep your inner self alive (I go to one).  Take care of yourself.  Life sure hands us some wild turns of fate, doesn't it?
I’m so very sorry. My mother only lived in stage seven a very short while. The physical and emotional toll it took on all of us was horrible. 

Has her feeding pattern changed at all?  My mother tapered off even her favorite foods. Then she was unable to swallow anything at all. She was gone shortly thereafter.
My mom is the same. I feel so bad for her.
Wow dude, I literally just started crying reading this.  I'm an only child of two loving parents and both of them have had dementia for about a year.  My dad was diagnosed a few months earlier than my mom but my dad is 82 and mom is 71 but my dad has kept it more together than my mom.  She has been getting worse every day and after her last u.t.i it's almost like she has gotten progressively worse each day.  This is by far the hardest situation I've ever dealt with in my life and I'm loss at what to do or how to feel.  I've gained so much respect for people like you and the caregivers that do this for a living.  Just joined this reddit thread just now and I'm going to try to educate myself on how to deal with the emotional aspect because I'm literally burning out and need to look at this life curveball at a different angle.  I'll throw a prayer your way tonight.  Thanks for posting this dude.  Take care. Much love ❤️
This sounds like absolute hell. Does mom own her house? if she’s got low income and assets she should qualify for a personal care aide through the Medicaid waiver home care program.
My aunt lived like that for a long time.  Like you, her son moved home to take care of her.  It lasted for nearly 14 years, even after a heart attack and stroke.  My poor cousin had PTSD from never leaving the house.  He had some help, but not at night, so he didn’t eat dinner out for 10 years.  I wish you the best of luck.  You are a good person.",2022-01-29 00:01:35,CountyMinimum910,sfagxm
Alzheimers,I secretly wish my grandmother would be relieved,"My grandmother is 93 and was diagnosed many years ago. She's the strongest and kindest woman I ever knew, she was kicked from her home country in the 1948 war in Palestine and thrown into a refugee camp where her only option to survive as a woman was to marry my late grandfather who was an absolute dictator. She lovingly raised 11 bright children despite enduring so much horrible bullshit from my late grandfather. She's my idol and a symbol of strength and hope. 

It's been well over 10 years since she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and has been suffering from late stage symptoms for a few years now. Nowadays she sleeps once every three days and medications only make it worse and cause more problems and she can't communicate her pains. When I think about it my heart breaks, it must be a pain worse than death to be in that state, and she fell and broke her hip a few months ago.

Despite her age and her condition, she's blessed with a curse which is good health, all her tests are good and she has no problems with her heart, liver, kidneys etc. The emotions I feel are extremely complex, I feel really guilty, even though I'm not her caregiver and now I barely see her because I study abroad, it has been a very long journey and I secretly wish she would just pass and be relieved, she endured so much bullshit while sane and now this! I don't know what to think or do anymore and I just want it to end. Is there something wrong with me?","No, what you are describing is that you don’t want her to have to live with such a poor quality of life. 

My grandmother has dementia, and my dad has AD. I wouldn’t wish either on anyone. It’s such a cruel disease, and I wish there was some miracle cure. But there isn’t. 

Big hugs.
I believe, there is nothing wrong in wanting a loved one’s suffering to end. My mom is pretty healthy too and has dementia. I know she doesn’t want to live this way . Before she got worse , she always said she just wanted to die. Now her memory is so short its all but gone. Terrible way to live.she doesn’t deserve it.  Not really living at all. I pray she passes peacefully in her sleep.
Every day, but my Mom.
I wished my grandmother would die, too.  She didn't have Alzheimer's, but she had colon cancer and lingered longer than most folks thought she would.  She used to say ""I'm just waiting to die,"" which may not be as morbid as it sounds because she believed in an afterlife.  Anyway, I was relieved when she passed as I knew her suffering was over.

(I was not a caregiver to her.)
Completely feel this. This was similar to my nanna, now my dad has it and my aunt said the other day that in some ways he's blessed with a heart condition. My nanna lived for years not being able to communicate, lying in a bed. It gives me great comfort that Dad might be taken before it gets too bad. Wishing you love OP and everyone else on this forum.

Alzheimers,Help!! Need advice on how to interact with sister-in-law who has Alzheimer's,"My sister-in-law has early onset Alzheimer's. It runs in my wife's family, but only affects the women. Her grandmother, mother, and oldest sister died of the the disease and her next older sister is pretty far along. She is at the stage where she doesn't recognize her own home or her son but can still form thoughts about those things and wonder where they are.

She's staying with us for a week while her son is away for work. They live pretty far out in rural Canada and it's expensive for her son to hire in help while he's away (he's a geologist and frequently travels for  surveying) so we figured we'd have her with us while he does a job here in the States. (BTW, getting folks into a govt-subsidized facility in Canada involves years-long waiting lists) Plus, she's been having him call my wife frequently over the last months and saying how she wants to come visit.

My wife is doing her best to keep her engaged and keep her from becoming anxious but it is getting stressful. What is the best way to interact with someone who is repeatedly asking about the same things over and over? (who brought me here? how am I getting home? Is someone stealing my house? Can I drive home?)

Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: Thank you to those who are trying to help. It's been a stressful day. Probably for her as well because she's not in familiar surroundings. Her son has, unfortunately, had to cut his work trip short so that he can get her back home. We would take her but the documentation explaining her condition only references him so we can't get her across the border to get her back home.

We still have another two days with her so I will keep everyone's tips in mind. Thank you to all of you!  


Second edit: Well, she's with us for the full week now. The good thing is that, thanks to all of you, we've learned how to communicate to her in a way that keeps her from getting too anxious. We agree with her for a lot of stuff but redirect when it comes to her car, going home, or leaving. It has reduced the tension in the house but I can see where it would get extremely tiring to have to do long-term. Her son is due to return on Friday but have to wonder if that will actually happen as we are due for another winter storm Thursday that will definitely affect air travel.  


Again, thanks to everyone for their tips and stories. It has helped more than you know!","Frequently repeated questions are common.  Keep answering the question and don't be fazed by it.

Paranoid thought such as ""someone stealing my house"" is a little harder.  I think just repeating, no, nobody's stealing your house would be okay.  You can also try redirection.  ""We can talk about that after you have a snack.""

Can I drive home, the answer is always going to be no.  ""But Jerry will pick you up on Friday"" might be a way to reassure.

Pleasant music from an earlier era is one good way to lower the anxiety level, if she seems to like it.
Reassure and redirect.  Briefly answer the questions I’m a positive way (it is okay to bend the truth to keep her calm), and change the subject.  

Keep her busy with projects.  “(Son) will be here to drive you home in a few days.  Let’s work on a surprise valentine for him!”

Or “(son) is away on a work trip, so you get to stay with us for a few days.  I am so happy to have you here for a visit.  I love spending time with you.  Let’s go pick out some puzzles to do together while you are here!”

My mother in law finds it relaxing to listen to the Beatles, Elton John, etc.  She also likes watching older movies.  Think of movies/shows that might have been popular when was a child.  We laugh a lot watching old episodes of Father Knows Best.

Have her help with easy repetitive tasks.  Folding laundry, matching socks, putting away silverware.  Anything to keep her hands busy and mind occupied.   We also do crossword puzzles everyday together.  Waking is always good.  If it is too cold, you can walk around a shopping mall.

Just keep reassuring and change the subject.  It can be really hard.  You can get through it!
Keep your answers as positive as you can so she doesn't get anxious. White lies or redirection helps a lot. ""It's just a visit, [son] will take you home soon!""

For my dad we can keep him pretty busy with an old movie.
It sounds like the visit is ending, but for future reference I really like Teepa Snow's videos for practical advice. [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2E2lPBsUeBjA1Utglo8q6yANAijEf8cX) is a great one.
Break down time into smaller bites. Instead of “going home in 3 days”, say “tomorrow.” Im currently visiting my parents & my mom with dementia is a real handful.  “Pack your bags & get the hell out” or “When are you leaving” are common mantras. I always say tomorrow.

Edit:

Also, dementia patients have lost their analytical thinking skills so don’t bother with who, what, where, when, why questions? They now operate with only their intuitive thinking which is why they read moods & your slightest body movements or frustration so well",2022-01-28 13:59:57,opticsnake,sexyft
Alzheimers,I will NOT die for you.,"I take care of an alzheimer patient in her home. I work long LONG shifts(12-20hrs) of no sleep (cant trust her). Shes not a good person and was abusive to everyone her whole life. I only got hired on to help take care of her 3 years ago.


Anyway, im going to be vague (in case anyone i know is reading)


Its very normal for her to be combative,  physically and verbally. Sometimes everyday a week, sometimes once a week. Usually its for something silly like changing clothes or taking meds, in which we can just say ""okay!"" And try again in a few minutes/hours.


Last night there was a fire alarm in the building. We're 6 stories up. The fire alarm was LOUD and when it goes off, 3 alarms are sounding off in each apartment while flashing lights, and about 10 in the hallways of each floor. It was late so i knew it wasnt just ""testing the alarms"".


Things got CHAOTIC. she was so weak she couldnt walk with her walker, i had to run to get the wheelchair, even the 2.5 seconds i ran to get it, she fell against the wall. She was clawing me, kicking me, cussing me out, hitting me, refusing to get in the wheelchair yet she could hardly stand and definitely couldnt walk. I had to think fast and grab her a coat as its about 0° out(again, gone for mere seconds and she was getting up trying to run away), when i went to open the door she kicked it shut and held her feet against the door so i couldnt open it. The elevators were obviously shut down, so we had to go to the stairwell, the whole time she is putting all her might shoving her feet against the floor so i could barely push the wheelchair, all the while trying to claw my arms. She wasnt acting like an ""out of her mind batshit crazy person just rambling nonsense"" but just straight up fighting against me while telling me to ""get the fuck away, fuck off!"".  When we get to the stairwell, she is trying to escape (but again, was too weak to walk) so i had to hold her as firmly yet gently as i could to stay seated in the wheelchair, otherwise all it would take is her to fall foward and tumble down the stairs.


The stairwell smelled like burning so i definitely knew then it wasnt a drill.


It took around FIVE MINUTES to get her out of her apartment. From where she was sitting to the door was about 15 feet, and it took 5 minutes!!! All the while getting beat up on. This isnt inckuding the time it took to go down the hallway to the stairwell.


Luckily the fire was contained but my whole body was shaking out of stress and out of anger. If the building had actually been in more serious danger of a bigger fire, i am 100% confident we would have DIED because of her. I have a small child who needs his mom,  i dont deserve this shit. Even getting her from the stairway back to her apartment once it was deemed safe and the alarm was off (20 mins later of combating me in the stairwell) it took forever and more abuse getting her back and into bed. She was yelling obscenities at me telling me to ""get the fuck away"" while kicking me and dragging her feet. 


All we did was evacuate to the stairwell and stayed on the flat part that was connected to our floor. In NO WAY would i have been able to get her down the 6 flights of stairs had it been necessary for survival, as i am petite and she is so combative and too weak to walk.


Next time, i will not die for you. Im sorry i wont.","[deleted]
No, you don’t deserve this. And no, you shouldn’t die for her. I hope you’re able to get the respite you need (a better job!) and she gets into a home more suited to her care needs.
Looks like it's time to move on to another job.

If you stay with this job you'll need to talk with the building manager, family and research how to safely get your patient out in an emergency.
Can you talk to her family to see if she can see her physician?  She may be at the stage where she needs some medication to help with anxiety and aggressiveness.
This kind of thing terrifies me. I take care of my mom.  If this kinda behavior starts happening, what if someone misunderstands and thinks -I’m- abusing her and calls the cops? I already had someone report us falsely out of spite because we’re on the second floor and my moms wheelchair makes too much noise and she gets up at all hours and wheels around 😞 the cop and social worker who came were nice but my mom is still able to explain that I’m not abusing her and that our neighbor was out to get us.  What if she gets like this though???
Sounds like the family need to get some risk assessments sorted and a plan in case there's a serious fire!!  Surely if something happened to you they would be liable even if it is under the table? I don't know anything about this but I'd be asking Reddit legal advice community for peace of mind.
You do not deserve this treatment at all, and this woman needs better medical intervention to keep her calm. You might think it’s a good gig being paid under the table, but you’re still legally considered her caretaker from a liability standpoint. If you’re in a dangerous situation like this again and you have to choose between your life and hers or you just have to emergency quit, you could be held liable in court for abandonment. You need to quit this job or speak with her POA/family about getting you better resources and managing her tantrums so you can work safely.
I'm really sorry you had to go through that. I'm pretty sure the fire alarm set her off bad. That can't be fixed. She probably needs her medication adjusted.

And you need to talk to who ever pays the bills that changes are in order for your sake.
This is horrible!! I’m sorry you had to go through this. I know how it is like being a petite caregiver to an elder living with Alzheimer’s, but they weren’t combative. 

In case it is life/death scenario, everyone needs to have an action plan and realistically it is not possible for 1 caregiver to help a resistant elderly in case of an emergency like this. I hope you don’t have to go through something like this again.
Omg.  That’s rough. I literally thought “chloroform would settle her down”",2022-01-28 12:38:09,ayediosmiooo,sew4kk
Alzheimers,Stressing about putting my dad in a nursing home,"My dad now needs round the clock care and has progressed drastically since having kidney issues. He’s running out of money and applying for Medicaid has been a bit of a nightmare because I didn’t control his finances until a bit after he was diagnosed. The things he was doing financially before that has been a nightmare to figure out. On top of dealing with that, I’m so stressed about actually finding a nursing home and putting him in there. He was in a rehab not long ago and it was absolutely awful. He lost over 20 pounds in three weeks and was getting sores from them not changing him properly. I’m so worried I’m going to choose a nursing home like this again. I live on the other side of the country and am his only family willing to look after him so I wouldn’t be able to go there all that often.

How do I deal with this? Is there any way to ensure I’m making the best decision?","Usually the nursing home helps with medicaid. In my case, my mom was already a resident at the nursing home when the money ran out so I dont know if that matters but regardless I'd say they can help guide you through the process but you need to get on it.  You'll need a place with a memory unit and not all of them have that. At least this was my experience. 

I was terrified about applying for medicaid too. I did a horrible job of keeping records of all of moms money. She had several IRAs that we used up on assisted living centers and I didn't  keep very good records about it. I also lost her medicare card somehow. She was sent a new one with a new number and I couldnt find it. I was in a complete  and total panic!! I was really scared that my siblings would find out I screwed up and get mad at me.

The nursing home was a huge help though. The only documentation that I ended up needing was bank statements. The people at the bank were really helpful about getting me everything. I eventually got a new medicare card too. 

Take a deep breath and don't get too stressed. Focus on finding a nursing home nearby that has a medicaid bed and can accept memory care patients. This should be priority one. Tell the nursing home administration your situation. They can give you some guidance so you don't feel like you're in this by yourself.
I would move him to a facility near you. There are a lot of pitfalls for both you and him by trying to manage his care from so far away.
I would try and get him to a facility near you.  Also, see if there is an Area Agency on Aging near you - give them a call - they can help.
It’s a big decision. My dad is currently in a Assisted living facility. He is still very aware but has awful short term memory and forgets family members, I can tell you it’s really hard, but it’s most likely for the best. My father has been pretty happy, care staff is very nice and he’s made friends with them. If $ is a issue consider a go fund me , isn’t long term but people really care and would donate, I would.",2022-01-28 11:28:26,blackopsbarbie,seuljk
Alzheimers,Psychedelics and Alzheimer,"Several scientific data show that psychedelics help increase cognitive performance. Two recent reviews strongly suggest that psychedelics would benefit Alzheimer's patients. In summary, microdosing would increase synaptic plasticity, generate new neurons and decrease the amount of beta-amyloid after microdosing. These structural changes would help to alleviate the deficiencies that this disease produces. The microdoses for psilocybin would be 15mg per 70kg. This would be about 1g of psychedelic mushroom, if 1% of its weight is the psilocybin compound. I hope it helps those who wish to have an alternative option to the conventional one. The links to the amaba reviews are here:

""Generate new neurons""?
Oh that's scary.  Dementia patients are already prone to delusions and hallucinations, why would we give them an agent that stimulates such effects?  Definitely not in my house!
This looks very exciting but still seems tentative. I cannot access the full text of the second article but it seems, from the one abstract and the one concluding discussion that we presently only have preclinical  studies indicating the possibility of actually impact on MCI / AZ.
In terms of scientific backing for various treatments this is my take on the rankings:
BTW criticism  /  constructive suggestions are welcome.

1. PROBIOTICS
    I. Scientific evidence. Multiple human studies and systematic reviews indicate a clear impact on MCI. Possible impact on AZ treatment and probable impact on AZ prevention.
     II. Side effects. Very mild, mostly digestive and temporary. Tiny number of serious cases with immunocompromised individuals.
     III. Impact. Significant

2. PHYSICAL EXERCISE
      I. Scientific evidence. Multiple human studies and systematic reviews indicate a clear impact on MCI. Mixed, moderate intensity exercises have biggest impact.  Possible impact on AZ treatment and probable impact on AZ prevention.
     II. Side effects. Following medical consultation, very small, especially as exercise of moderate intensity is sufficient. 
     III. Impact. Significant

3. PSYCHEDELICS
     I. Scientific evidence. Not enough human studies and systematic reviews indicating impact on MCI. Impact on AZ unknown.
     II. Side effects. Very mild physiologically speaking. Depending on dosage and treatment strategy, some risk of psychological side
 effects.
     III. Impact. No clear evidence on humans

3.  WIDELY USED PHARMACEUTICALS (cholinesterase inhibitors)
      I. Scientific evidence. Plentiful human studies and systematic reviews indicate very mild impact on MCI. Impact on AZ or AZ delay still unproven
     II. Side effects. Mild to moderate side effects including diarrhea, muscle cramps, headaches, insomnia etcI
     II. Impact. On average very weak, 2-4 points on the 30 point MMSE",2022-01-28 08:02:24,neurototeles,seqbaf
Alzheimers,Questions you wish you'd asked your loved one with Alz/Dementia before they forgot?,Hey guys I think I'm gonna make a video about my dad who has early onset and just wanted some inspiration on some good questions to ask him so I can treasure his responses and have something to remember him by before its too late for him to remember any stories or be true to the answers he would typically give! So what would you ask your loved one?,"My dad passed 2 months ago from Alzheimer's and I really wish I'd taken more videos so I'm glad you are thinking about this OP. I don't really have many suggestions as I think it may be pretty personal as to what you want to ask. For me, I would have asked about favorite memories of the two of us, maybe what they remember about when I was born, advice for the future. My dad died within 3 years of diagnosis and most of that was during COVID so by the time I thought of videos, he was too far gone. Best of luck, OP. Take lots of photos of the two of you. I started taking more but mostly after my dad had forgotten how to smile
Hi, my dad is dying and I filmed him a lot over the summer before he had a massive decline. I'm so glad I did it. I asked these questions: 
1. What is your advice for life?
2. Something about family (can't remember). 
3. Do you believe in God? (I don't personally really but it gives me comfort knowing that he believes in the afterlife). 
4. Filmed him just talking to the cat, who he loves. 
I'm really glad that I did it, and to be honest, I wish I'd done it sooner but I'm glad that his grandchildren will have it x
I don't have questions to contribute, but I wanted to add that I think this is a fantastic idea. Definitely made me tear up a bit, thinking about memories with my mom. 

I make her photo books with good captions, so even if she doesn't remember things, she can still enjoy them. It's more for her than for me, I should do something like you're doing that's more for me. I think we kind of forget about ourselves and what we need - I needed the reminder to do something for me today. ❤
my dad didn’t have AD but after he passed I wish I had Asked him more questions about his life. See if he remembers his old school days. Maybe he had a best friend or his first crush. What Kind of mischievous trouble did he Get into. What was his favorite subject, his least favorite. What dreams did he have. How did he feel when you were born. Maybe look at old photos with a new perspective and fill in the story behind the photo. After all our parents are only people trying to do the best they can . They had a whole life before we were born . what was that life like.
For me it was all the little sayings and mannerisms I thought I could never forget.   They happened so often, they were part of everyday life.  There is no way I can forget that.  After years of caring for him and finally loosing him to the disease I find myself struggling to recall and preserve them.

Alzheimers,"I’ve only been caring for this man for a few months, and it’s breaking my heart seeing how fast he’s fading away","For background, I just moved to a new city for college. I have babysitting experience and was looking for something along those lines. I found this woman who was desperate for any type of help with her husband. At first the Alzheimer’s didn’t seem like a big deal to me, he was so sweet and had the basic needs of any old man. I thought things were getting better when I reintroduced music to his life, by trying to re-teach him ukulele, and seeing his world light up when I found songs he used to love that’d we’d sing together. He even remembered my name for the first time recently. Then the other week his wife told me that he had an “episode” and is now on another medication. And now, I just got a message from her saying he’s very sick… and not the kind that’s contagious. She would always tell me that he doesn’t have much longer and now I’m afraid it’s coming true. I just wish there was something I could do to help both of them.","The old and dying are not kids (your previous occupation).  The outcome is always the same, all that differs is the rate of getting there.  If you are having troubling feelings about your patient, you probably would benefit by talking to someone about them.  Are you with an agency?  If so, your supervisor might be a good person.  I wouldn't talk it over with the man's wife, she has her own burdens to bear.

You have a kind heart.
Well, if she would welcome it, you could offer to still do music things with him, especially since he responded so well to it. Even if he can't visibly express enjoyment or actively participate, he may still benefit, even if its just to give him happy company on his way out. Maybe you and wife could sing to him w uke. 

Besides that music is a good go-to thing to try with Alzheimer's folks, its also thought that hearing is one of the last senses to go. 

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/07/200708105935.htm
You sound like a caring individual. I would just ask the wife what you can do to help. It might be just sitting with him or if he's able go on a short walk or put puzzles together. Something to give her a break. She might also need a cup of coffee or a hug from someone who is there witnessing this. 

This disease is different for everyone and everyone has coping skills that are different. But someone that cares and genuinely wants to help is a common need.
My wife was diadnosed mid last year after 2-3 rears of getting forgetful. Now on m eedication which is of questionable help. Also giving her heaps of herbal stuff, anything we read that maybe of help.

She can still function but at times does not remember where stuff is stored in tbe house. Not that bad, really.

I am being realistic about our future, but for the moment I am and will be her 24/7 carer for as long as possible and feasible.

It is hard for you, but you are supporting his wife, which will be her saving in the now time. Take comfort you are helping the couple, and not just the husband.",2022-01-27 19:01:26,Ambitious_Ad_1955,secp56
Alzheimers,Alzheimer's patient and toilet issues,"My grandfather in his 70s is now facing the problem of properly using a washroom its not that he cant use his reflexes its just that he does NOT want to enter toilet he wants to do wherever he wants . Its has become harder to force him and we dont hit him we try not even raise our voice ofc have a force with hand but to some extent we try our best to talk to him sweetly but we dont have our best days either we have life of our own too . He used to sit on toilet at first but these few months we are trying to make him atleast go to the washroom and pee while squatting (that's how he does no matter what) on floor and he does but now he's doesn't want to go in there at all we have to change his clothes two times a day lets not even talk about when he has to poop. There's is sudden rapid decline in his intrest to go to bathroom at all and we are not prepared for it at all he wants to do whatever he wants and he gets annoyed when we tell him what to do in best case ,in worse case he will hit. We cant use diapers too because he has a habit of taking off his trousers first ,we did try and as expected he it off.Anyone knows how to deal with this situation? any smaller suggestion helps alot . Also mind that this whole thing starts happening in few months","How do you know he is not having incontinence?  Incontinence happens with Alzheimer's. In addition, people with dementia also forget where the washroom is located and all of the steps for using the washroom.  And sometimes they don't recognize household fixtures, such as the toilet, and may confuse something else for a toilet. The confusion and forgetting can lead to people with dementia, especially men, going to the bathroom in inappropriate places. You can try a few things: If he is removing his diaper, there are special undergarments to help with this. It's called ""adaptive clothing"" - you can get an ""adult onesie"" which is designed to keep adults from removing their underwear. You can get it online from several places. One is ""BuckAndBuck"".  They also have trousers that close at the back. You can also try getting him on a toileting schedule: bring him in after meals and every couple hours. Also, if you supervise him closely you can lead him to the bathroom before he goes in the wrong place. Even with this, there are bound to still be accidents.",2022-01-27 14:33:21,o2asis,se6kkv
Alzheimers,"Children of people living with Alzheimer's, I had a question","my grandmother has it, and every time my mother forgets something I get worried out of my mind she is developing it. Hell, sometimes when I forget something myself I get scared and I'm young. Does this happen to others a lot?","Yes, it's friggin scary. My Mom has had a long battle and so did her brother. I'm 61. I say, try to make the best of every day, cause there are no guarantees. There are too many bad possibilities to your waste time on. Peace
I'm absolutely terrified that I'm going to get it, and also convinced that I will. I haven't had any sort of testing and don't think I'm presenting any symptoms, I just know that with my luck, I'm going to end up with it. My mum's 64, she was diagnosed 6 years ago, and she's at the point where she had to move into a care home last year and doesn't recognise anyone, doesn't even have an inkling that she knows them. She can barely speak - she tries frequently but all that comes out is a jumbled mess of sounds, barely even words, and it's definitely not coherent.

I'm only 31 but any time I forget something or lose something, it sends me into a complete panic because I think ""what if it's an early warning sign""? It's ok if it's something small that's just slipped my mind, and as soon as someone mentions it I recall it clearly, but it scares me when I have absolutely no recollection of something. I'm also going through a period of depression just now (mainly to do with grieving for my mum) and am finding that I have brain fog quite often, but I always worry about what if it's something more than that.

The other day for example, I dropped something whilst getting out of my car and going into my house. I remembered picking it up from the car but when I went to put everything away when I got inside, it was nowhere to be found. I searched and searched and couldn't stop shaking or crying because I couldn't even picture what I might have done with it between the car and the house. My husband found it where it had fallen just behind my car's tyre, but those ten minutes were absolutely horrific and shone a light on just how bad my fear of memory loss is. Obviously dropping things without realising is a totally normal thing to do but the sheer panic that filled me, that I might have done something and completely forgotten about it, was not a normal reaction.

I never want to live with Alzheimer's. I've been very clear and have told my husband that if I ever develop it, I'm going to kill myself. Watching what my mother's become... I never want to go through that. I'd rather be dead.
Yes me and my sister both experience some kind of co-dementia, that our behavior is similar to our parents, who both have dementia, more than before.
My ""patient"" is not a parent of mine but an older spouse.  But for all four of the years I have attended my support group, I continue to ask ""Is dementia contagious?  Because I feel like I'm losing my mind, too!""

It's not contagious, but when you are doing the mental work to manage somebody else's life on top of managing your own, your brain can get overwhelmed.  The other people in the group promise me it comes back when the dementia journey is concluded.
Absofuckinglutely.  My Mom and her dad were both dx with EOAD, so it seems like just a ticking time bomb before it hits me or one of my brothers.  I'm only 37, but the odds aren't exactly in my favor.  However accurate it may or may not be, I figure between me and my 2 brothers, we've each got a 33% of being the one that's caught (hopefully) later in life.
I do understand your concern but please don’t freak yourself out every time you or your mom forget something, it is normal to forget, especially as we grow older and our lives become more full and complicated. My maternal grandmother, two of my mom’s sisters and her cousin had or have dementia. And I am caring for my 89 year old mom who also was diagnosed with dementia. I know this… there are more of my family that has never been diagnosed and that keeps me hopeful. But like my mom did with me, I have discussed the possibility and my care with my children. Don’t live in fear. Learn about the disease and its early signs. For my mom, it wasn’t forgetting things first, she could no longer keep her things organized, then repeating stories and now after about 20 years of living with dementia, she has forgotten almost everything, and is pretty much nonverbal. But her laugh is hers. I made her a memory book filled with family photos and her life story that she loves to flip through every day. A playlist of her favorite movies, tv shows, songs and poems are played throughout the day. I wish she could tell me that everything is alright with her, that she is happy. But her smile and her laugh is enough.
My MIL has it and I freak out when I forget something.
Right there with you my friend.
Forgetting very specific words or details are normal as she gets older. Especially if she is going through menopause. Hormonal replacement therapy can help the menopausal brain fog.

IMO Alzheimer's in its very early stages symptoms aren't so much about failure to remember details, moreso falling for scams and strange behavior and personality. Also generally being an asshole to those you love. Which sucks because by the time you have more medical symptoms, you already destroyed your relationships so no one is there to notice or care. It's horrible.
Grandmother had it. Mom
Has it.. I'm doing everything I can to avoid it.
Remember that being a Caregiver for someone with dementia is EXTREMELY stressful, even if that person is very good at it.  The stress can contribute to memory lapses, etc.  We would say that it is okay if you forget where you put the car keys.  But when you forget what the car keys are for, then we've got trouble.
Lisa Genova recently wrote a book called Remember. She has YouTube clips with some of it. It talks about normal forgetfulness versus dementia, and it really made me feel better.
My grandma has it, her grandmother had it. I already have anxiety, so even if I don't get it I'll just spend my life worrying that I will.
100% this! My dad has it and part of the reason I went back to work six months after my daughter was born was because I was worried I was getting Alzheimer's and I didn't want to sit at home all day and think about him dying. I was forgetting things- conversations, news, books, etc. It's actually really scary and I worry about it a lot. I think it's completely normal- it's a horrible illness and it is like a worst case scenario thing so it's easy to become obsessed with it. Wishing you peace and happiness x
I’m finding I’m more forgetful than ever but i put it down to the worrying and being up late checking on my mother…
I don’t have a family member with it, but I worked with Alzheimer’s patients for over a decade. I totally see warning signs everywhere and I know how you feel.
It come and goes, I even thought to get DNA tested since my grandma and my father had/have the disease. Even if it's hard sometimes, try to live fully; since regardless how you will leave this world, we all one day hit the bucket. And when the pressure is too hard, don't be afraid to ask for help. Huge hugs, hang in there!
You have just put in words the daily fear I have. My mom had lewy-body dementia, and it was fast (which I was okay with). ANY time I forget something...I think here we go.
You’re definitely not the only one - my mom’s mom had Alzheimer’s and my mom has dementia, so I’ve definitely had my moments where I’ve sat there and been borderline paralyzed that one day that could happen to me too.
I am pretty young to be in this situation (15) but I see it differently, I try not to worry and if it’s confirmed you will panic but, you shouldn’t be worried till it’s a confirmed diagnosis.. if it is don’t miss a minute with them.. I look back in time every day and wish my dad remembered the great times we had…
My grandad and dad both had/have early onset dementia.

Of course it feels inevitable either me or my sister will develop it. 
But you have to seize the day and enjoy life.

For me, it just makes me keen to retire early as at 60 my dad can no longer travel etc so I’d love to retire in my mid/ late 40s if possible. 

Also, eating well and being physically active can very much slow or prevent some dementia’s.

Yup. My dad passed when I was in college from Alzheimer’s. My husband is seeking a ADHD diagnosis for similar symptoms to dementia (he’s older than me and we’ve been married a while now) and it’s really making me wonder if it’s ADHD or some form of dementia. Went down the rabbit hole looking at misdiagnosis rates because of the overlap of symptoms and learned there’s a link to the two. Yah I’m scared.",2022-01-27 11:07:20,throwawayamasub,se1te9
Alzheimers,Repetitive Questions,"I have been wondering if my mother is developing Alzheimer's, the problem is that some of the symptoms are part of how she's always operated so I can't really tell the difference. Also, her increasingly severe memory loss has strongly contributed to behavior that fit symptoms.

One thing that has stood out to me recently is repetitive questions. Now the difference to what I've read as the typical presentation of this symptom, being repetitive in the moment, is that her repetition is with every new interaction. Almost like a script of questions she asks every time we speak, but she doesn't seem to realize or remember that her questions have been repeating or that she has gotten those answers. Historically my mother has a tendency to not pay strong attention to conversations and so often forget what people say (unless it's gossip), this is why it's hard to tell for me if this is a progression of a normal habit of hers or a symptom of something else. I just wondered if anyone can share if this type of repetition fits with the symptom or an expanded definition of it?","FWIW My father was the same (and has Alzheimer's). For years he was known for having kind of a bad memory, and having the same conversations over and over. I also doubted that he might be sick, but he definitely follows a very specific conversation script and that has gotten worse over time. Now when I speak to him we repeat the same script every 3-5 minutes.  It's a bit like interacting with an NPC from a video game. 

He has a specific script for both and my brother, and covers different topics with each of us. Attempts to talk about anything else usually last for about 10-15 seconds before he come back to one of the 'scripted' points.
We're used to joke about people getting old and forgetful like it's normal and common. It's not. 

It's normal to get stiffer muscles, it's not normal to need a walker. That is significant change, worthy of a doctors visit. What you describe sounds like significant change, my advice is to go for a check up.  The symptoms may still be mild, but symptoms being present already says a lot.
I would say that the fact that  you are concerned is enough to get her to see her doctor.  My MIL has Alzheimer's and always had a terrible memory - the way we were able to tell is that she would ask a question.  Then 2-3 minutes later, ask the same question.  Then another 2-3 minutes later, you got it, the same question.  We would leave their house talking about how something was off.  If you feel something is up, it's probably best to get help.  About 3-4 months after us noticing something was off, my MILs doctor noticed, too, and she got tested.  She also had a history of it in her family.
Could be run of the mill dementia. Have you gotten her tested by a neurologist?",2022-01-26 21:32:00,nicejanie,sdnhbg
Alzheimers,Help for a loved one?,"Hi guys, this is a long read so please bear with me. 

Tl;Dr: my moms showing progressive signs of memory loss and I’m looking for ways to help her. 

So for quite a while (5-ish years) I’ve (F28) noticed my moms (46 at the time) memory getting weak. It started innocently. She’d forget something I told her a week or two ago. Or forget something from her docs appointment. I’d point this out to her and she brush it off with a joke. If I persisted she’d get defensive and say it’s no big deal. I didn’t live with her at the time so I figured that we weren’t talking every day so it’s normal for her to not remember everything in my life. 
She also has hearing loss, requiring hearing aids, so I chalked it up to her not hearing properly. 

But then my father (54) who lives with her started noticing it. And became not just things we’d say but things through text. Arguments would ensue, her insisting we didn’t tell her only for us to pull up the text she acknowledged. And then she’d get defensive. But it was always non-important things. Like telling her when I’d becoming for a visit and such. 

It’s slowly been getting worse, and now I’m noticing that she’s forgetting more recent things (I also live at home now, and she’s now 51) For instance yesterday she was trying to tell me something she saw on the news 1hr earlier and forgot most of the story. She now acknowledges that she does have a memory problem, but doesn’t know what to do. She doesn’t feel that her doctor takes this stuff seriously, and there are some days where her memory is great. 

There appears to be no long term memory loss. It’s just short term memory or creating new memories. She has recently started a new job in an office where she has a lot to learn, so I’m not sure if that’s affecting her. 

She’s constantly doing things to “exercise” her brain, like crosswords, wheel of fortune and jeopardy. 

Is there anything I can do for her to stop this getting worse, other than trying to convince her to talk to a doctor? She’s open to supplements (like neuriva) but I’m not sure if that placebo or if it does help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, with my line of work (health care) I’ve seen the bitter end of Alzheimer’s and dementia and is like to avoid or delay this as much as possible.","Honestly, a doctor is the only one who can say for sure what's going on and what options you have.
[deleted]
She needs to see a sleep specialist.  Obstructive Apnea causes a very low O2 at night, and your brain can't do its ""work"" of filing things away.
Oh OP this tugged my heartstrings as it sounds exactly like what I went through with my mother. I have a couple of medical and non medical suggestions for you. 
1) acknowledge that outside of convincing her something is wrong with her memory, arguing with her will always make her defensive and confused. Try to agree with her, particularly if it’s something inconsequential
2) we started with a private occupational therapy assessment, which was the first thing to document significant memory loss. This step could be skipped if you were to connect with a good doc willing to do a full neuro assessment. 
3) look out for other personality changes and document them. Eg our mom suddenly got very jealous of any relationship we pursued with our dad which was very out of character and we think now an early sign of dementia. 
4) it sounds to me like your mom is experiencing MCI or mild cognitive impairment. It would be something to look into. 
5) connect with a good doc and in the meantime try not to panic. You honestly can control nothing and everyone is so young there could be decades of medical intervention ahead of you ( or none at all!). 
6) very seriously, and with no sarcasm at all - consider  finding a good therapist. I completely unraveled just after the birth of my son because I hadn’t dealt with my feelings about my mom for the last ten years. 

Good luck to you
It's more likely this is related to perimenopause and menopause than early onset dementia. She can discuss this and any other symptoms she's having with her gyn. If her gyn is not a specialist in menopause and all it's varying symptoms, then she can find someone that is. If you're in the US, one source for finding a doctor is NAMS.  There are tons of women in varying stages of menopause that either joke or seriously fear that they have dementia. It's a common complaint.
Consider the MIND diet and daily walks.  Is she having any issues sleeping or sleep apnea?  One symptom of Vitamin B12 deficiency is memory loss, taking a vitamin b12 supplement once per week (2000 mcg) can help avoid deficiency.

https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/
Background: I have a family member in their 70's with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's, and as a result I spent five months intensely studying the scientific literature full-time to become well-informed on the subject. Otherwise, my main background is mathematics.

My opinion: While there could be other causes, I'm sorry to say that the symptoms are the classic initial symptoms of Alzheimer's. I suggest getting an MRI through her PCP right away, and also pursuing referrals to neurologists who will order a lumbar puncture (a.k.a. spinal tap) which can give an authoritative diagnosis.

In parallel, I suggest considering enrollment in one of the following two phase 2 clinical trials of mid-region tau antibodies (either of which will do their own biomarker tests to confirm the diagnosis), which in my opinion have the best chance of helping someone in the early stages of cognitive decline:

* [JNJ-63733657](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04619420) by Janssen / Johnson & Johnson
* [bepranemab](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04867616) a.k.a. UCB0107 by UCB in partnership with Roche

Furthermore, given the age of symptom onset, if it is Alzheimer's then there's a good chance that this is likely autosomal dominant Alzheimer's, meaning due to a mutation in either the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes, a single copy of which deterministically gives one Alzheimer's with symptoms starting typically in one's 40's. If that's so, then one of her biological parents should have had early onset Alzheimer's as well. Do you know if this is the case? (If not, and they both lived into their 60's, then this is some evidence against the Alzheimer's hypothesis.) Furthermore, if that is what you're dealing with, then that means there is a 50% chance each for her full biological siblings and children to develop early onset Alzheimer's. That's scary, but there's a lot that can be done right now if you're in that camp:

First, get a genetic test from e.g. 23andMe and upload the data to Promethease to see if you have one of the genes in question. If you do, I recommend strongly considering enrollment in [the phase 3 prevention trial](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01760005) of gantenerumab and solanezumab (amyloid antibodies, which are more likely to be beneficial in the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease before the amyloid-β has caused the tau pathology which likely leads to neurodegeneration) by the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network.

My sincere condolences and best wishes for your mother's situation.
Start the Bredesen protocol immediately. Perhaps you still have time to slow or turn it around. It won’t work for everyone but you might find a solution here. 

The Dale Breeesen idea is that the cause could be multifactorial. For instance, special blood work could show high toxin or mold levels, which cause dementia. Or potentially there is an inflammatory response from foods in the diet, which a blood test will identify. 

Starting now gives you the best chance. I wish I started sooner with my mother. My mom also denied it and it was hard to discuss her memory issues with her during early stages. You need yo let her know it is serious and that you need to take action now.",2022-01-26 09:16:42,CDNEmpire,sd6yiu
Alzheimers,"Aduhelm, the Alzheimer's Association, and Corruption","This is what evil looks like. 

Last summer, with pressure from the Alzheimer's Association and against the recommendation of their advisory committee, the FDA approved Biogen's new Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm. Besides not being effective (the drug has failed to significantly reduce AD symptoms in clinical trials), it is also accompanied by some very unpleasant side effects, and a price tag around $28,000/year. 

This has prompted a tremendous backlash from the scientific community, and earlier this month, CMS decided that it would not cover the cost of Aduhelm unless the patient is part of an ongoing clinical trial to test the drug. 

Well, Biogen (who is one of the Alzheimer's Association's biggest donors) stands to lose a LOT of profit on this decision, and the Alzheimer's Association is now pushing back against CMS. They claim that CMS's decision discriminates against all people with Alzheimer's disease, and especially against women, Black, and Hispanic people who are disproportionately affected by AD. 

I disagree. I think pushing a wildly expensive, ineffective drug on a vulnerable population that is desperate for ANYTHING that can help them is nothing short of predatory. Claiming that this CMS decision is discriminatory is absolutely shameful. 

[https://lowninstitute.org/why-access-to-aduhelm-wont-improve-health-equity/](https://lowninstitute.org/why-access-to-aduhelm-wont-improve-health-equity/)","The CMS decision actually blocks all future monoclonal antibody drugs that treat alzheimers.   It is not just targeted at aduhelm.  Every amyloid drug that is a monoclonal antibody will not be allowed to be given unless a person is in a clinical trial.  Clinical trials also take about 2 years to get running and pharmaceutical companies always pay for the drugs in clinical trials anyway.

This means if another company has a much more effective monoclonal ab drug, they too will be blocked from possibly using it in the population based on this decision from CMS.  It also greatly impedes any companies' motivation to continue researching Alzheimer's drugs at all.  And if this proposal goes through, their decision cannot just simply be changed. It takes about 2 years for that to happen.

The drugs cost has also been hyped for news and clicks.  It's cost is not really different from other monoclonal antibodies especially since it was cut essentially in half.  It's also important to note that biogen has agreed to pay any cost that is not covered by Medicare so most people will essentially pay nothing.


While aduhelm has been controversial, this decision by CMS will make Alzheimer's research in total take a pretty big hit.

Alzheimers,Look At My New Clothes,"My father has developed a behavior that is equal parts amusing, baffling, and frustrating.  It is the clothes he decides to wear.  Our whole life, our family has always gifted him clothes that will work together because fashion has never been his strong suit.  However, as his symptoms get worse, he doesn't wear things that fit or are even his.  He's taken to wearing my mom's clothes quite regularly.  Not anything obviously feminine (he's not living out his dream of cross dressing) but rather her jeans.  They're 4 inches too short and her shirts are way too tight, but he wears them as well.  The family finds this part amusing.  The other day he put on his grand daughter's yoga pants that were left at his house.  She's 11 years old.  I'd call this part baffling and is an image no one wants in their head.  Then recently he found a bag of clothes left in the woods by, presumably, a homeless person.  He acted as if he found treasure.  He washed and cleaned these clothes (they were way way too big) then tied them on with rope and shoe string so they'd stay up and wouldn't fall off.  He only wore these for a few days, until we disappeared them.  They were just too out there for anyone encountering to treat him with dignity and we felt the need to protect his dignity.  On Wednesday, we had a speaker at our church's men's group.  The speaker had a hat that he put on a table.  My father picked up the hat and wore it home.  Fortunately my father left his coat at church so he and the speaker were able to make a swap (coat for hat) and my dad felt like he got a great deal out of the event.

Anyway, this is just so strange that I can't wrap my brain around it.  I try to hard to laugh and have fun with the things that are harmless, but as this behavior amplifies it is just sadder and sadder.

my husband found my jeans yesterday and they fit him pretty good . I need them myself so he had to take them off. Every time I put them back he put them on again . Guess I will need to hide mine. He also likes to wear weight lifting gloves . The problem is he always gets 2 fingers stuck and I have to help him several times a day as he takes them on and off. Last night he was talking about boats. He finally mentioned Trump and the boats, I figured out we were watching the news and they were talking about vote not boats. LOL.
Can't top the outfit found in the woods.  But for wacky combinations and things that don't go, I'll put my husband up against your dad any day.  Today he put on pajama bottoms over his jeans.  Yesterday he was wearing my sweater dress over his normal street clothes, thinking he had found a cozy sweater.  He often wants to wear my winter coat, because he can't find his (leaves things all over the house, no rhyme nor reason).  I really do not encourage him to wear my things, I need them for myself, and the winter coat was quite expensive and I don't trust him with it.",2022-01-25 13:51:30,Tracewell,sckw6h
Alzheimers,How to manage care costs for parent with high retirement income and significant property assets?,"My mom (72/F, divorced) is approaching the stage at which we’ll need to consider memory care within the next few years. And while I’m aware of spending down for Medicaid, I have no idea how this would be possible given that her federal retirement income is nearly $6,000/month (increasing 2-5% every year for cost of living) and she has nearly $400k in assets (two homes and many acres of land) that she planned for me to inherit after her death (“bye, bye” to that). That said, because she’s coasted on her high retirement income, she has nothing in savings, and the homes/land aren’t exactly liquid.

Given these considerations, would we be better off getting her into private memory care and using whatever money we get from selling her homes/property to cover any costs over $6k/month? Or should we just try to somehow spend down so she can qualify for Medicaid?

My husband and I do pretty well combined, but between my $100k student debt and nonprofit salary, we don’t make enough to meaningfully supplement her care without eventually going bankrupt.","Talk to a lawyer about putting her assets into a trust, now.
Have you toured the facilities you would potential place her? There’s typically a big aesthetic difference between assisted livings (which don’t take Medicaid unless your state has waivers and they’re rare) and nursing homes. The quality/ratio of staff isn’t necessarily different between the two, but the feel of the places is definitely different. You might get more clarity about your question if you know which you’re comfortable having your mom live in. Most people don’t choose nursing homes over assisted livings unless they absolutely have to.
You need to speak with a financial advisor/attorney asap before you run out of time to make solid choices for your future.
You need a certified elder law attorney, licensed in the state where your mother lives/will be living (I wasn't clear if she'd be staying in Georgia even if she enters memory care). You can use the [NELF site](https://nelf.org/) to find one. Yes, a pension will count against her Medicaid eligibility. While a Medicaid assets protection trust is a possibility, Medicaid has a 5-year lookback period, so they would affect her Medicaid eligibility until 5 years past trust creation.",2022-01-24 23:37:18,NotedHeathen,sc58i0
Alzheimers,What do I even title this,"The burn out has become greater. Grandma's volity was gotten worse. 

Her mood swings have gotten worse, a few months ago we had to wean her off of trazodone which she had been one for 4 decades. Bc she was taking PM pills in the AM then sleeping all day, in the dark house so her body clock was completely warped. She picks out the Low dose Effexor from her case, bc thats not the right pill, and she thinks if she doesn't take it then she will met grandpa at the pearly gates faster. 

My mom stopped by to get her trash, she was still in the clothes she had on 4 days before hadn't bathed since. Ran out of pajamas and didn't bother to do her laundry which was piled in front of the washer. So she had been sleeping in those clothes too. Her excuse was well I wasn't going anywhere so I didn't see the point. *sigh* but you literally left 4 times to get something to eat. 

She refuses to allow us to have a home aid come in and do the cleaning she refuses to do. She gets super agitated if anyone remotely tries to clean.. Im a single parent working 2 jobs, my mom has 2 jobs. One uncle is pretty hands off, the other does what he can as the golden child. So the burnout is definitely affecting us mentally bc its like a 3rd job. 

We are inquiring to see if med management is possible for someone that's is living in the independent cottages on the nursing home property. Unfortunately she isn't to the level of needing the dicated dementia wing, and she would put up one hell of a fight if we got her a placement into the assisted living wing. Even though she would have weekly house keeping and a kitchenette. 

I'm about to tell my mom book her for the next available appt with her neurologist, and we are having a come to Jesus meeting. Bc something isn't working.","That's a good idea,, the come to Jesus meeting.  Your grandma isn't able to live alone - the medication issue is a big reason why.  You should probably contact a local agency on aging to find out what your options are for care centers as well as for funding.
She's been on trazodone for 40 years.  Googling, there seems to be a connection between certain antidepressants and getting Alzheimer's.  On the other hand, there are comments about Paxil being somewhat protective against it, and I've known two people who have taken Paxil for years and are fine.  I might bet against atenolol and for lisinopril, which certainly protects against diabetes.  (Yes, we have a doctor in the family.)

Alzheimers,New to parent with memory issues,"I’m 36 and my dad is 77, he just started having memory issues. 
His life partner broke up with him and this is the first time he has lived alone. 
He has never been alone, he has always had someone to take care of him from his mother, to my mother, to me, to girlfriend to girlfriend to his ex. 
He still drives, he knows how to do basic living like showering and dressing himself but he struggles with cooking. He set the fire alarm off 3 times in his apartment so he isn’t allowed to use the stove anymore. He does not get technology or new things, he literally leaves his TV on because he is afraid he won’t be able to turn it back on. I bought him a tablet and he cannot figure it out. I have to fix his phone constantly.
I’m almost certain he may have a learning disability too with the way he struggles with learning new things but I’m not sure. He also went way too long without being able to hear properly, he has hearing aids now but I swear it’s like he still doesn’t pay attention. 
I get calls from people in town periodically stating that they saw my dad and he looked confused. I check on him and he denies this. 
I feel awful because I know he is too independent to want to accept a higher level of care and he wants to continue living his life like there are no issues such as going to Florida alone. He used to always go with his partner who would do the driving and I just am not comfortable having him go alone.
He just recently had me take over his finances because of his memory issues. He said he just forgets names and sometimes when things are happening. Like he misses doctors appointments so I have to have them tell me when it is. He still goes to them alone but I’m afraid he isn’t retaining what they are saying due to hearing and memory issues.

I’m feeling stressed and worried all the time. I’m in the prime of my career and I cannot afford to not work and stay with him and I also don’t want to make him feel like I’m taking away his independence 

Today when I told him I wasn’t comfortable with him going to Florida alone he got very upset and said he will do what he wants.

I have no siblings to help me and I hate to burden my husband.

I feel selfish and guilty all the time 
I’m hoping someone else understands this and maybe we can lean on each other?","You can't make him face facts, but you can face them yourself.  Try to go to his doctor appointments with him ""to remember important points.""  Before his next primary care appointment, call ahead and ask them to assess his mental status because you think it's declining, and ask what they recommend regarding his driving (at all, not only interstate).  You'll probably have to get him to sign a two-way release of information with the doctor.

But it's good that he's asked you for help with his finances.  Very gradually, you can take on more decisions and responsibiities.

Call your areas' agency on aging or Aging and Disability Resource Center.  Consider joining a caregiver support group (hugely helpful).  Some of these are virtual and some meet in person.

Good luck.  You don't have to become his full time caregiver - but you are asking the right questions.
I am so sorry that I don't really have any advice but I can so relate to your story!

During these covid restrictions, my mum was in hospital for an extended stay without me there translating (just English, but dumbing it down for her) and it was super evident to the doctors that she had something going on - yep Alzheimer's. 

Your dad no doubt knows that he is struggling but will do everything he can to shield it from you and deny it to himself. That is what my mum did. But more and more as time went on I was always having to 'fix' her air con, her phone, her electric blanket, her stove, and so on. The last thing she did was leave her water running, probably overnight, and it caused a four fold increase in her water usage. Anyway, nothing was actually broken - she had forgotten how to use it. I tried to buy her things to make it easier for her but she couldn't learn new things, exactly what you said above. Your GP might tell you, as mine did, that she was 'getting on' and some memory loss was expected, but I knew that it was more. Nobody would listen to me until she was isolated from me. Them they could see it.

Your dad is unlikely to let you take him to get an assessment, but if he happens to be hospitalised for any reason you could express your concerns and request that they delve deeper. They would hopefully start assessing him while he is there. But it is an anxious wait for you.

I was always on tenterhooks when she was living at home by herself. She did have a personal alarm, but it was getting to the point where she might burn the house down, so I am so glad they decided that she could not go home and live by herself. She is in aged care now and doing really well because they make sure she gets all of her medications regularly, eats three times a day and showers and sleeps. She is more alert and happier than I have seen her in a long time.

I do hope you don't have to face a crisis like we did, before your dad gets some help. I know your helplessness! Please try to get things in place before this happens, such as POA and Medical POA. My mother refused to have it done officially because she said it was a waste of money, since I was already doing all the things required (bank, business etc). So then I had to get it done officially through the courts so that I could manage her funds to be able to pay for her aged care home. 

Good luck with your Dad.",2022-01-24 18:12:48,snickerdoodle85,sbzfp3
Alzheimers,Memory Care,How on earth do people pay for this?  My mom has Alzheimers and she has 2 pensions and SS and still can't afford it.  Me and my sister aren't really in a position to help her either.  We both have kids and and households of our own.  This is so stressful!,"You spend down the person's assets till they are no more than $2000 and then they go on Medicaid.  Hope you weren't hoping to inherit anything.

I advise you not to take on that financial burden yourself.
Not much help to you, but perhaps something for others to think about...my mom has a long family history of Alzheimers and knew what was coming, and bought long term care insurance, and it's taking care of her. I have no idea how much she paid, and I certainly don't have money to pay for my own, but it's made life a lot less stressful.
Ended up having to turn our mom over to the state - felt pretty shitty
I know. It’s absolutely insane.
I’m slowly seeing the last of my parents money disappear. My dad was a penny pincher. After he died, my brother and sister took advantage of my moms giving news and maybe predementia and pretty much bled her dry. Fortunately, mom is a simple living person, and her needs were not much. Cigarettes, 100 dollars worth of groceries and cable tv. 4 years of getting her out of debt and getting some savings back in her account. Then I decided it was time, I was exhausted, still am. No help from my siblings or family. And she was slipping further and further. Got her in memory care, her income almost matched her monthly rent and care. Sold her house. It’s the hospital stays and medications that are depleting her savings now. 
I wasn’t really hoping to gain any inheritance from this, I just want her safe, and for her to enjoy what she has left on earth.
It is an awful system. I have to use some of my money to make her monthly payment at the place
There are many places that have an “elderly waiver” so you pay until the money runs out and then Medicare pays. Usually the better quality care facilities only accept private pay.
Bankruptcy honestly. We sold my mom's house to use the equity, paid for as much of her meds and foods as we could afford from our own savings (I dread the thought of retirement after being her caregiver for 13 years as I have nothing other than my husband's 401k and half his pension, and that's if I outlive him). After five years of having her in assisted living after she started wandering, she was bankrupt, and only then did Medicaid kick in and pay for her care.
Unfortunately she's going to have to go on Medicaid.  My mom had to do that - if you have a good facility, their financial person can help walk  you through it.  The woman at my mom's facility told me that unless you're independently wealthy, you'll eventually end up on Medicaid.  My mom didn't have much money, but still had to spend down some of it to meet the threshold.  One of the suggestions I got from both the facility and the funeral home our family uses is to set up an irrevocable burial account - that way you can set aside money for her final expenses and it won't count towards that spend down.  The account is only payable upon her death - so you don't want to put all of her money in it, but it is kind of a way to ""hide"" some of it.
Yup it’s a scam and a damn shame.
Once they take all your parents money, Medicaid can put a lien on your parents house and will agree to take that after they die to pay for it. I’m really sorry, we are going through the same thing.",2022-01-24 18:45:38,haha_k_bye,sc02nj
Alzheimers,Is there something I can add to automatically shut off my stove? He's gotten to the habit of leaving it on,"My dad will leave an empty pan burning on the stove top and walk away from it.

Lately it's been happening almost every day. Sometimes several times a day. We won't know until the smoke alarm goes off.

I already put child safety caps over three of the four stove top knobs. Just to prevent him from bumping into them and turning the gas on that way. Which was a problem. But we couldn't stop him from being able to cook for himself completely because he would throw a fit whenever we try to control him like that.

So how can we let him use the stove without killing us?","I found this page https://www.thiscaringhome.org/automatic-stove-turn-off-devices/ but i dont know how good any of it is. Haven't tried any.
My dad just started to live on his own and he doesn’t know how to cook and burns things on the stove all the time and sets off the alarm in his building. He has done it 3 times now and the landlord said that if there is a 4th time she is going to evict him. He just smokes the place it’s never a fire but he over cooks burgers. So no more stove for him.
We moved ours to a different breaker and flipped the switch when we needed to use it.
By code there is a shut off valve behind the stove but it really inaccessible  unless you pull the stove out. I would get a plumber to come in and put a valve in the cabinet.
There is something called Fire Avert.  But it looks like that will shut off the stove if it senses a smoke detector.
I wonder if an electrician could install a timer knob on the wall that he would turn to switch on the stove
Can you take the knobs off? It probably depends if he’s still mechanically inclined still. 

I had to put a box over my moms thermostat because she would play with it and get it too hot or too cold. That is one thing I do not miss this winter, worrying about the temperature. I ordered a nest but by the time I got enough money to finally get it installed (new wiring) it was already spring.
We tried the breaker trick and shut off gas to the stove, but my mom figured out how to access and turn those back on. It was maddening. Removing the stove was the next thing we were thinking of, but then she started wandering and sleeping only a couple of hours a night, so we moved her into assisted living.
Sounds like it’s time for home care or assisted living. If he’s at this point he needs supervision. If it’s not the stove it will be something else very quickly and you want to get him used to the idea of having constant help especially if he’s already at the meltdown over small losses of independence stage.",2022-01-24 12:48:26,kappakingtut2,sbrwbb

Alzheimers,Mom was diagnosed,"Hello hello,

I am 29 from NYC. Writing at an ungodly hour as I cannot sleep, and thought this would be a good opportunity for my first Reddit post. 

My mom was recently diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's at 60. Needless to say, it was one of the saddest doctor's appointments I had ever been to - I was gutted. 

To make matters worse, two years ago I had done the 23andMe Health+, unwittingly opening pandora's box of genetic predispositions. Turns out I have 1 variant of the APOE4 Gene. 

My questions are below:

How did you cope with a parent's diagnosis at a young age?

How seriously do I need to take this APOE4 carrier status?

&#x200B;

<3","Don't know about 60. Im M31,

My father got his early onset at 65.

At 61 he got the Marfan one, and until i got tested there were good chances i was also positive on it.  (3 years later and one before the Alzheimer one i will also have to deal with my mother cancer)

We completely lost 2011, we didn't have any social resources for various reasons. Probably also that was a reason why Alzheimer came together with the amount of stress. It was only me and him. It was heavy. But at a certain point you realize death isn't just around the corner and you start crawling out.

At the end his aorta stopped magically growing 3mm before operation red line. Alzheimer is taking long time, after his early onset it has been already 7 years. Yesterday we saw Paul movie, he still laughs and have tons of fun. I bring him and include him in the new Years and Christmas parties with my GF and friends.  Yes his speaking is way more problematic but we still go forward. I just got a giant 12 year old. That in no way wants to eat meat LOL.

Thats the trick. Don't ignore the sickness, but don't give it power to scare you, it will just make everything worst, activate your social security nets, friends and family, talk early with family on caregiving, who will do what, and on the importance of looking both on internal family help that external. Here in my city in Italy i also got support group for us family caregivers, look for ones. You will find balance.
Very sorry for the news. Alzheimer's is horrible and early onset is especially unfair. 

Try to make photo albums and label scrapbooks with her, and take video recordings of her talking about her life memories on her good days 

Have you got financial and medical POA? Is she married? Does she own her home or rent?

https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/medicaid-eligibility-new-york/
I'm so sorry about your mom. It runs in my family and I have perpetual background anxiety for my 67 year old mom, her mom was diagnosed around that age. 

But I'm really commenting to say these genes are NOT a sentencing when it comes to Alzheimers. I have 1 copy of APOE4 and 1 copy of APOE3. Am I statistically more at risk to develop alzheimers? Yes. However, there are people with these genes who never develop the disease. There are people who don't have these genes who do develop this disease. I take comfort in knowing that according to recent studies alzheimers onset can hinge heavily on lifestyle. My mom and I focus on our health, we stay moving, we exercise, and try to eat healthy. I keep my genetically high cholesterol managed, we have physicals annualy, dental cleanings regularly, and all other visits required for maintaining our health. 

Her mom was type 2 diabetic, and very sedentary as she got older. She lived far away, and I don't think she had much social stimulation. I think all of that counts when it comes to this disease. Focus on your health and cherish time with your mom. It's all we can do for now. I hold on to hope that medical science will make more leaps and bounds for us and younger generations in the future.
My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s a few years ago and just turned 60 too. I don’t have a lot of advice but I’m so sorry. This is an awful disease and it’s heartbreaking to watch your mom decline and disappear in front of you. I have been dealing with it for a few years now, unofficially I knew something was wrong a few years prior, and I have some nights where I can’t sleep either. Sometimes are really hard, something will remind me of what I’ve lost and it is weird process to grieve someone while they are still alive. I miss my mom so much and she’s still here but sometimes I’m overwhelmed trying to spend time with her because it is getting increasingly hard especially since I have young children to care for too. The only advice I have to start therapy and be kind to yourself, it’s a really hard situation and grief will take different forms. Talk to a doctor about your own risk factors and make sure to prioritize your physical and mental health.
Hey my mom was diagnosed at 57, I have 2
Young kids and I’m struggling through it too! I was 30 when she got diagnosed. It’s been 3 years, and I am totally open to chatting if you want. We are probably at similar stages!
Oh hi, friend. I learned in 2017 that I (38/F), too, have one copy of APOE4. My mom, who was showing odd verbal blips at the time (always reversing pronouns), took the test soon after me at my behest and also came up with one copy of the gene. Fast forward to fall 2020, my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s at 71.

Needless to say, since her diagnosis especially, I take prevention VERY seriously. Since fall 2020, I’ve overhauled my entire life (from couch potato to powerlifter, junk food addict to low-sugar, low saturated fat, whole foods, so on) in hopes of avoiding the same fate. 

I closely follow the protocol outlined in Dale Bredesen’s “End of Alzheimer’s” and regularly check the apoe4.info forums for the latest research and clinical trial updates.

The earlier you start, the better. If you smoke, quit. Drink? Ditto. APOe4 means that we have a lot of disregulation in terms of how we metabolize fats, so reducing saturated fats and increasing PUFAs and Omega 3s is critical.

Good luck on your journey. I’m so sorry you’re in this terrible club, too. I’m also in NYC, so if you ever wanted to meet for coffee and talk (I’m fully vaxxed and boosted), my DMs are open.
This is really similar to my situation. My dad was diagnosed at 63-64 I believe. It was early onset and has since progressed then, it was honestly hard to notice for first year or two, then he started forgetting keys, and then covid, which was the increase in his deterioration , as of November 2021 he was moved to a Assisted care facility which was for his saftey, it hasn’t been easy since I was 11 at time of diagonals, and then my parents divorced shortly after that. I wish I utilized the very limited time i had with him more, he’s still her but forgetting so many people and memories, and he’s forgotten me before. I am trying to say that you should spend as much time as possible with your mom as possible and get therapy sessions (if accessible)",2022-01-24 02:35:10,ssaeglopurr,sbgjay
Alzheimers,How young can you have alzheimers or dementia?,"I've made a post already on another sub going into detail. I'm just wondering how young you can get alzheiners, dementia or any other memory problems. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.","I’ve heard of people as young as in their 30s with early onset. But there could be many explanations for memory loss. Sleep deprivation, dehydration, thyroid problems. Even hormone imbalance
There could be dozens of reasons why you can't remember things. When diagnosing my dad they did tons of scans and tests. 

Stress is my main reason for not remembering things. Combine that with having cancer and I will have so recollection of events, conversations and tasks.

You need to see a doctor. Only they can narrow down the root cause.
[deleted]
Usually a diagnosis in your 30’s would typically be from familial early onset - and its genetic. Our family carries one of the mutations & so far - its hit in early 40’s. There are a plethora of reasons for memory disorders- I always had a poor memory, after taking a battery of tests - I found out I had a learning disorder (I had no idea). 
**eFad (genetic) is so rare the odds of me meeting another carrier are astronomical. 
** early onset alzheimer’s is usually diagnosed in 40’s & 50’s - however there is no actual test - just a series of test to rule out other diseases.",2022-01-23 12:12:55,Couldnt_BeMe,sayeoy

Alzheimers,How do I deal with guilt?,"I’m 20 and my mom (55) was diagnosed almost a year ago, but she’s been dealing with symptoms for 4 years now. I’ve become a mom to my mom, she comes to me for all her needs and wants or for a chat. I want to move out and have my own life though, I’m only 20. But I’m staying at home because I feel guilty, and I worry I would feel worse if I move.. what should I do?","This sounds so difficult for someone as young as you. I would suggest you have a sit down with your mum and discuss what the future might look like. Including lots of scenario planning and what she would want you to do on her behalf if she can't organise it herself. She may not realise how much this is affecting you. My mum becomes increasingly self absorbed as her symptoms get worse, I think it's just difficult for her to have any perspective when she can't think straight. Are you in the UK? If so, I would get in touch with social services and see what they can do for you. Also talk to Alzheimer's society and age UK. If you're in the US, I'm sure you have equivalent organisations.
First of all, I’m somewhat in the same situation as you but I am turning 33 tomorrow.  So I sympathize.  Second, never ever feel guilty for having feelings so natural.  You are doing and feeling what any normal 20 year old would do or feel but you’re not a normal 20 year old, you have been forced to be a mom to your own mom since 16.  You are a wonderful daughter whatever you decide to do.
I have no advice. I hear you and I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope someone has the advice you are looking for.
I’m so sorry, hun. What’s the situation with your relatives? Can’t they step up?
You need to make an exit plan. You and she will never get younger, and she will never get better than she is now. It is only downhill. Do you live in the US? [https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/resources/locator\_tool](https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/resources/locator_tool)
I'm so sorry you're in this situation. There is no right answer so really only you can decide what's best for you. I know I'm about to throw an overused saying at you, but it's true - You can't pour from an empty cup. If you are your mom's only support, you need to take care of yourself throughout her decline just as much as you take care of her. Unfortunately, this is an uphill marathon and you won't do either of you any good if your current situation is already burning you out emotionally. While your mom can still participate in this conversation, I would try to have an honest conversation about how you feel and you both talk about your wishes and hopes for how you'd like to handle everything moving forward. Even if you don't move out, it's may be helpful to start carving out parts of your every day that are just for you so you can recenter yourself before jumping back into support for your mom. During that time, try to find something that brings you some calm and quiet whether it's meditation, working out, reading, journaling, baking etc. The guilt you feel is so normal. Just know that she would want you to be taken care of too.
I'm so sorry. I agree that morally you're utterly justified in moving out and having your own life. Does your mom have a partner or other family aside from you who is helping or could help?
Time for Mom to go into memory care and for you to get on with your life.
You need to think about what is best for your mom and make your decision based on that. Guilt is on both sides of that decision, do what you think is best.
I understand your frustration. I am 29 and my mom was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.  

Trust me, there will be so many opportunities to make up for the times you sacrificed in order to support your mom. 30 or 40 years down the road, after you've lived life a little bit more, you may not exactly cherish these moments -- they are tough, grueling, sad, all of it --  but you won't exactly resent them either. 

Do not feel guilty, though. Evaluate the support system, if you need to lean on family. It really is a group effort.
I’d like to hear from those who had to make this decision at a young age…. I’m 28 and my dad is quickly declining. My mom is tired. We are in the first stages of this and it’s getting harder each month.   

Do I stay in my hometown and help through to the end? Do I go and live the life I wanted and possibly lose my mom too? If I knew I wanted to live here forever I’d get a house close to family and help out when I’m needed, but I don’t want to be here for the next 10 years if that’s how long it will take. 

18% of spousal caregivers die BEFORE their patient. I’m worried about my moms health through this journey.  

I’m stuck, I feel guilty as well, and I don’t know what to do. For now I am staying and helping, but I can’t shake the fact that when My partner and I are financially ready to move I have to make up my mind and decide.  

I am aware that staying and helping through the end would be the best decision for my family and would make me happy to a certain extent but I know the end of the day I need my own life too. 

Sorry I have No advice for you.  I’m just in the same boat.  it helps me knowing other people are struggling too and that I’m not alone in this.  Keep researching and asking for opinions. It all helps.
I feel you. I want to do more for my grandpa but I know I can't, and I have my own life to attend to (I'm 22). It's rough. Stay strong",2022-01-23 10:41:19,Freebusparking,sawbyk
Alzheimers,New discoveries on probiotics and AZ,"If anyone is interested in potentially exciting new discoveries re AZ symptom mitigation please read on: I lost my mom to AZ a few years back and in the process I turned the internet upside down looking for solutions. It is too late for my mom but a lot of exciting stuff is going on right now focused on probiotics and the microbiome in Europe and Asia. We can see lots of converging evidence correlating consumption of B. Breve 03 or A1 with decrease in Mild Cognitive Disorder and mitigation of AZ symptoms. I am presently getting it sent from the UK by a friend, and the only thing I can say is that it definitely increases my energy and creativity.  Why is nobody selling this in the US? Oh, of course, it would drive the manufacturers of those scammy AZ pharmaceuticals out of business. You know, the ones that shift the MMSE by 2 to 3 points out of 30.

Anyway, these are the most relevant studies including wide ranging systematic reviews. They do not yet provide 100% proof of effectiveness but probiotics have very few serious side effects so what do we lose?

Alzheimers,How do you deal?,"How do you all deal with the mood swings and the guilt? I have days where I feel nothing at all, days where I almost forget the horror of this disease and feel normal, and days where I'm wracked with guilt about whether I could have done/be doing more, guilt from just wishing it was over? It feels like I can't talk to anyone about it, mom is dealing with it from a spouses pov, my brother chooses to just not think about it, my sister gets a ""pass"" for some reason. I'm always the one my mom calls, and I have my own family to deal with. What do you do to get through the days where it seems like anything makes you break down and want to give up?","Therapy. And remind yourself that there’s nothing you could have done to prevent this.  Any help you CAN provide your parents is more than they would have without.  Your family has to come first. 

For me trying to do enough is a trap.  Enough doesn’t have a definition.  No matter how much more you do, you can still feel like it wasn’t enough. Don’t entertain thoughts of doing “enough”. 

Your responsibility is to take care of yourself and your family first, and help your parents where you can second. Exercise, good diet, and enough sleep.  You will be better prepared to care for others if you have taken care of yourself first.
I snapped and decided to get therapy - was very very helpful
Oh yeah, the resentment & guilt cycle is a beast.  My mom is extremely unpleasant to me. I’m her target. My parents are well off so when dad decides it’s time to move to either assisted care (both) or long term care (her)  they will have no issues. Context: it’s already *really past* time but that’s not my decision.  I don’t live locally but for my own sanity going forward, I don’t think I’ll visit much until she’s placed. When I do, I’ll stop in for lunches or meet my dad elsewhere.  The problem is she might easily outlive him, then we have the real fun. Fuck dementia",2022-01-23 00:47:13,Meangrd01,samgzo
Alzheimers,My mom was diagnosed 4 years ago at the age of 64. My father is her constant punching bag.,"I realize this is all part of the disease,  but my mother exhibits anger towards my father on a daily basis. He has less and less time to himself. 

I’m a young father who tries to balance everything and help both of my parents as much as possible. When I am not there, I am always thinking about their situation. 

She’s not in a position yet where she needs full time care, but it’s nearing the horizon. I feel horrible wishing that it would come sooner so that my dad can get a break. Can anyone relate to this experience? Does the pain ever go away?","My Mom is mean to my Dad (she has it, he doesn't) however my Dad is an ass. He has no patience and was never a care giver so my siblings and I looked for outside help for two reasons:
Mom is lonely and Dad needs breaks. We found a local place that they come and visit and evaluate what could help them as Mom doesn't need full time care yet but Dad can't be her full time caregiver because he isn't equipped in a myriad of ways (broken back, temper, recovering alcoholic).
Caregivers need breaks too. Look to see who might be able to offer something similar.

This disease is terrible. Breaks my heart ever time I go over to visit. 

I am the only one here out of my sibs so I have taken over helping Dad with their fiance's.
My man. I could've written every word of this myself. Unfortunately I don't think I have much to offer other than commiseration -- I understand exactly where you are. My Dad's actually meeting with someone on Monday to start moving things forward to get my Mom placed in long-term care. In my opinion she's not quite there yet, but I fully understand and support my Dad's choices. He's a wise man and he's handled all this with more compassion and grace than I even knew he had.
It's the same but my dad is the one sick. He treated all the kids OK as the disease progressed but mom was the focus of his anger/frustration. She got the yelling, the snide comments, the venom. We all saw our father transition from our dad to someone who doesn't even know he has kids but mom caught all his anger during the transition. Even now, with him in end stages, she gets the brunt when he's frustrated. I completely understand the thought of ""if only it was over"". Every time I have that thought I wrestle with the guilt of what it means, that I basically want my dad to pass. I'd put money that everyone dealing with this disease has that thought and deals with that guilt. You're not alone, even if at times it feels like you are.
Is there an affordable day care?  We sent mom there and she didn’t hate it.
My dad is also the punching bag. He's taken on so much since her diagnosis. Once she starts sundowning she's so nasty to him. I want to help, but Dad says I'm doing enough. I just started renovating my (paternal) grandmother's house. We all agree it's time to downsize and it has about half the space.
My mum isn't mean to my dad. Instead she takes it all out on me. I get to be the punching bag and I constantly have to remind myself that it's the disease.

I don't have any advice other than empathy for the emotional and mental pain and stress that I'm guessing your dad is going through. It's hard to keep remembering that it's the disease doing it and not your mum talking. 

Maybe your dad can reach out to your countries Alzheimer's/Dementia organisation to get advice or therapy on how to cope with it. Even you could do it and talk to your dad about it.
I am so sorry for everyone going through this. Wondering if you could ask a medical professional if an antidepressant would be advised?
Oh yeah, the resentment & guilt cycle is a beast.  My mom is extremely unpleasant to me. She’s always been a handful & now I’m her punching bag. She’s always angry AF & super paranoid. She got physical with me because I wanted to take a shower. She stole my towel & wouldn’t allow me to close the door for privacy. Dad denies she’s awful to him but I can hear them when she forgets how to hang up a phone and, for 10 minutes, privy to their conversation. She got mad at him tonight and ran sobbing to her room. 

My parents are well off so when dad decides it’s time to move to either assisted care (both) or long term care (her)  they will have no issues. Context: it’s already *really past* time but that’s not my decision.  Besides her initial diagnosis 4 or 5 years ago, there has been no effort to take advantage of resources or request support.  His brother died from Alz & he saw him in his final week- it was ugly AF- so maybe that’s playing a role in his denial decision to downplay this/ try to hide/ justify that it’s not that bad (It is) 

I don’t live locally but for my own sanity going forward, I don’t think I’ll visit much until she’s placed. When I do, I’ll stop in for lunches or meet my dad elsewhere.  It’s a lot & he’s 84 with terrible COPD & a pacemaker. The scariest scenario is that she might easily outlive him, then we have the real fun of placing her against her will & without dad to buffer the transition.  Fuck dementia.
It's the same for my Mom,Dad has Alzheimer's in my case. It's a terrible thing to watch, so heart breaking. My Mom has no life anymore,I think how you feel is very normal,don't beat yourself up over it!",2022-01-22 15:15:57,whiskeywaters,sab28b
Alzheimers,A gut feeling,"I can't shake this gut feeling I have that my dad is at the end of his fight with Alzheimer's. He was diagnosed 8 years ago at 70 years old. Medications had worked for years to keep it low progressing. 

The past 3 years have been hospital stays and increasing falls. 3 of which have put him in the hospital/rehab. (Rehab took a toll and actually caused a broken hip requiring surgery) 

He is now barely there he has maybe 2 good days a week at best. 

My mom brought him back north to see his new grandson, his brothers, myself and siblings and basically our whole family saw him this year. They stayed with my husband and I. I haven't been able to shake this feeling that I'm going to get a call any day now saying he's passed away. Even though just yesterday my mom said he had a good day and hes in the background talking to me through the phone.

I literally can't shake it, I cry every day because I just feel it. I'm not sure how to handle this. Has anyone dealt with this feeling?","Is hard, you probably right in what you are feeling.

 Remember the hardest lesson in life is to learn to let go.

Take care.
You could very well be right, that he is going to pass soon, and anticipatory grief is a very real thing. 

Is it possible to get him assessed for hospice? Most hospice organizations have a social worker who you can talk to about how youre feeling

Alzheimers,What do you do?,"My dad has moderate to severe AZ, and this week has been rough. 

He’s been staying with my sister, but she and her husband work. I live hours away and can stay for the weekend, but I’ll need to return home on Sunday. 

Dad spent the evening in the ER. He need some assistance now. How are we supposed to pull this off so quickly? He went from bad to worse so quickly. 

What a mess all this is.","It’s not easy. When we were in a jam I called everyone I knew who might be able to help or might know someone who could help. We ended up paying my friends teenage daughter to come and sit with my mom to make her meals and coffee, and do some basic activities to keep my mom engaged. We found that repetitive actions like folding dish towels or wash clothes was very soothing. See if you county has an office for the aged, call the Alzheimer’s association they may be able to steer you to resources. If your dad belonged to a church, synagogue or mosque reach out to them too.
Changing locations always messes up the mind.
I took a leave of absence from work and called home care agencies and let them know I needed coverage asap.  Someone with moderate to severe AZ is not safe alone so you've been lucky that you haven't had to hire help or had a disaster before now. He'll need consistent help from this point forward.

Alzheimers,Any apps for tracking meds and doctors appointments?,My dad was just diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  My mom also has a lot of health issues going on.  My sister and I are working with them the best we can.  I'm 2 hours away and my sister is 10hours away.  Has anyone found an app that is easy to use(technology is getting harder for both of them) that could be used to track what their meds and dosages are as well as all scheduled appointments?  I've thought about setting up a Google calendar that can be shared amongst us but not sure they will get it.,"Idk about meds and such, but we use Family Wall app that you can share with whomever you want. This has worked out very well for family members wanting to visit my grandma or take her out, and not being thrown off by an unknown Drs appointment. We have about 20+ added to her calendar, and it has made a huge difference since my grandma has lost the understanding of time ect.
If he has an electronic medical chart, get permission for proxy access.  Then you can see any time you want what his latest meds and health issues are.
For meds and doses I have simply made a Google doc. My father (with alzheimers) doesn't use the doc, but my mother who is his primary caretaker has really appreciated the help with keeping all his information organized. My dad has many other health issues (heart problems, diabetes, etc.), so having all the current meds and doses up to date on a doc is extremely helpful when going to varied specialist appointments. Almost every doctor's office loves when we hand them this printout. 

I would love to hear about an app that can do it better!",2022-01-21 18:30:07,athiest_nerd,s9o6g3
Alzheimers,Is there a checklist? I’m having trouble helping him prepare.,"My 82-year-old father was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and will be losing his licence in about a month. Him and I have a very difficult relationship. I have mental/cognitive / chronic pain /disability problems myself and I’m having trouble thinking and organizing this stage of his life. It’s on me and there isn’t much help from the state here in Canada. He doesn’t offer much input, either, except the myriad of supports he says he doesn’t want. He lives in an isolated community about ten hrs away and he can’t live with me. I have power of attorney and am currently sorting his bills and taxes out so we can apply for care homes. 

If there’s anything you could suggest as far as what we need to do to help him prepare or things to watch for with his property or finances or applications I really appreciate it.","Oh, sorry to hear that, that's tough.

Alzheimers,Resources for elder planning for not-yet-diagnosed mom,"My 62 yo mom has been exhibiting symptoms of Alzheimer’s for several years now but she’s extremely reluctant to get professional help. Her dad recently passed away and his estate planning has been a real mess for his children. Because my mom now sees the value in having a plan in place early, I’d like to start the conversation about her own preferences when it comes to aging, death, etc. 

Question: does someone out there have a list of questions we can use as a guide for talking about hard-to-talk-about stuff? For example: 

1. If needed, do you have a preference for who you’d like to manage your finances/medical care/etc. (ie, who do want to manage your money and stuff?)

2. If needed, do you have a preference for the type of care you’d prefer if you ever get to the point where you cannot care for yourself? (Ie, is there a nursing home you have in mind or do you want to stay home no matter what if possible?)

3. When the time comes, do you have any preferences for when it comes to your funeral, burial, etc? 

There’s a lot missing here, but hopefully you get the gist of what I’m looking for. 

Lastly, any tips for having this conversation with loved ones? I know this isn’t dinner small talk but is it better to have a sit down discussion and hit as many questions as possible in one go? Or spread it out over time? I live in a different country so I plan wait til I’m with her in person but open to hearing others experience here.","Get an elder lawyer.  Someone who deals with this on a daily basis. They will help you set up what you need, and make sure you have the important stuff decided.
You could look into an Advanced Directive / durable medical power of attorney for her as a first step. I live in the US and my state has a template document you can fill out instead of doing it through a lawyer or completely on your own: https://mihin.org/advance-care-planning-resources/

I just completed that for my mom and it's a huge relief. Now we move on to financial PoA.

As far as tips, I would say do it all in one go and fill one out for yourself as well so she doesn't feel so targeted. You could also try getting a social worker through her doctor or just see if you know anyone who might know a social worker who's willing to explain it.

My mom also doesn't think there's an issue. Once we got a social worker in her home though, she changed her mind. All he did was ask her questions like ""well who would you want to make decisions if you're not able?"",  nothing complicated, but I think having a 3rd party involved really helped. Good luck.
The Alzheimer’s association website has lists and suggestions for people at the beginning like you are.  The also have a 24 hour support hotline you can call and ask exactly this question.  We redid our estate plan with an attorney (elder care lawyer is preferable). They’ll walk you through Medicare/Medicaid depending on your situation.  Get a handle on finances including banks, account numbers, titling.  Ask about retirement income, 401k, IRAs, pensions.  Where are the important documents.  What are their wishes with regard to care and feeding.  Funeral plans.  It was many conversations over months for us to prepare.",2022-01-21 15:55:46,Famous_General7876,s9kphj
Alzheimers,My grandpa loves to work.,"I recently moved in with my grandparents so they wouldn’t have to go into a nursing home.

I basically just play cards with him, do word searches and watch westerns and WW2 docs with him all day. Thing is he gets very antsy around 3 or 4pm everyday thinking he needs to go somewhere or do something. When I ask him what we need to do he just says “I don’t know” and gets angry. He loves to work. He unfortunately worked everyday for like 45 years and I believe his brain thinks he needs to go just out of habit. I am wondering if there are any jobs I could give him? What’s like a manly job he might enjoy doing?  Any suggestions are appreciated!","We gave my mother-in-law a plastic drawer with many dividers from the Dollar store. We bought a bunch of little items such as buttons, ribbons etc and she can spend a lot of time sorting them into the various compartments. Her sorting system changes each day. 

For your Grandad, perhaps you could get things like screws, nails, washers, etc. you can tell him that they need to be organized and it would be a big help if he could do this. He may or may not enjoy this but tactile activities can be relaxing for them and they can feel productive.
You could tell him he just got home from work and now it's his time to relax. Never ask, just divert. Try some music from his era.
Folding clean towels/underwear/socks, clipping coupons, shining his shoes, filling weekly pill containers with vitamins, running a handful of papers (worthless/harmless papers you hand him) into the shredder (pull it out of the closet) one by one, handing you clean dishes one by one from the dishwasher/drying rack while you put each one away, tidying up books on the bookshelf, watering a small potted plant, sorting the clean forks/spoons/butter knives into their slots in the drawer. My grandmother used to pray the rosary during this time with a follow-along recording too. I hope one of these items sticks.
He may also need more physical exercise like long walks, etc, if he can. He maybe used to a lot of moving and changing to a sedentary lifestyle can be jarring.
Late evening is a difficult time. Sundowning often starts around 4:00. My mother had trouble then no matter how active we had been during the day. 

You’ve received some great ideas. The big thing for us was to keep Mom busy and close to us. She would do well sitting at the table while I fixed dinner. I would give her something to do. She did poorly if I would leave her watching tv while I fixed dinner. She would start heading “home.”  This helped for a long time. Eventually she did need medicine because her Sundowning got worse and included hallucinations. I only say this so you can watch out for that possibly starting. 

Sounds like you are doing great. Good luck.
This phenomenon is called sundowning and if you Google it you'll find that is very common! There is no permanent fix for it, so make a list of things you can try, and try to match them to that days mood.

Someone who's just checking the time can still be diverted by a 'I did the groceries already/ partner is getting the kids today/etc' but someone who's in the confused wandering phase may not be calmed down by that anymore.

Alzheimers,"I'm going to have to be the ""bad guy"" with my Dad and his pension - and I don't know how to approach it.","My Dad was diagnosed with vascular dementia about 6 years ago, and 4 years ago had the 'full blown' Alzheimers diagnosis. He was 62 at the time.  


Of course - this upended his life. He was a 767 pilot - and now he wasn't allowed to drive a car.  
As a result, he's medically signed off permanently. He claims benefits (he had no money, but we'll get onto that).  


He has a support team - they are excellent and I can't praise them highly enough.  


For various reasons he had to declare bankruptcy - again the support team were fantastic about that.  


Me and my younger brother are registered as Power of Attorney for him - something he was keen on. The majority of his stresses are financial, and we wanted to take that stress away from him.  


Bankruptcy - sorted. Benefit payments - sorted.  


Now, the spanner in the works - he forgot he had pensions. A letter comes through the door telling him he was a £38k pension waiting for him. I panic. If the benefits office find out about this, then they will stop his benefits.  


A helpful family friend helps my Dad by connecting him to his tax attorney - Dad now figures ""Hooray, I have £38k coming, I can start looking at a holiday, or buying some shiny new tech"" (he loves his tech).  


Meanwhile my brother and I are... concerned. He spends all sorts of money in some sort of black hole - we have no idea where it goes (though we're looking to rectify that now we have the LPA). The benefits aren't great, but we don't understand where his money is going. He's always short every month by ""a few hundred... can you loan me?"" and I always do, accepting it's not a loan.  


Also - yon family friend hasn't ACTUALLY ""sorted it"" like Dad seems to believe - he's expecting thousands of pounds to just end up in his account.  


I now have to be the ""bad guy"". It's his money and I'm not taking it away from him but I have to try and explain he's not suddenly going to ""rich"" - I'm going to try and ask him what he needs it for, how it potentially has to last for a few years yet.  


He's expecting to just have a load of money in his bank, and I'm going to have to be the one who says ""Look mate, that isn't happening like you think it's going to happen"".  


He's going to be upset with me - which is fine I can take it. But does anyone have some good advice around how I soften the blow a little bit?","My Grandma has latched onto a vague ""they"" as in.... ""They took my car"" ""they made me leave my house"" ect .... She's usually sad/slightly upset by these necessary events, but not angry, and doesn't direct it at any specific family member.

I was just wondering if covid 19 makes Alzheimer's worse even after covid recovery? I was wondering if anyone has had any experience of a loved one with Alzheimer's, catching covid 19 and what the outcome was? 

Thanks guys,","Hi! My dad had it in September of last year. He is about midway through the disease process (I think). He is 70 and has no comorbidities other than dementia. He was fully vaxxed in January of last year. 

He developed Covid pneumonia very quickly (like 5 days in) and was hospitalized. He also recovered very quickly and was discharged after 3 days. It took him about 2-3 weeks to recover his strength and mobility. He was very very tired after being discharged and I was so concerned, but he pulled through. 

It made his dementia worse, but I did see some improvement of functioning once he was healed and feeling good. It’s hard to tell if Covid caused a permanent exacerbation of dementia symptoms or if his dementia just progressed naturally.",2022-01-21 05:07:13,Dvgamble,s97hyx

My Dad was my best friend and I thought I had more time with him, and it doesn’t feel real that I will never see him again. I am 24 and have no relationship with my mom and I’m just feeling so alone and sad.","I’m sorry for your loss. I can hear how much your father meant to you, the deeper the sadness means how much love you shared.  It sounds like you had a very special relationship.  Those memories will be a comfort when the shock subsides.  My thoughts are with you.
My sincere condolences go out to you. It is truly heartbreaking to have someone so dear be wrenched out of your life. The loss will become bearable. It will. Just not immediately. As best you can attempt to focus on the wonderful memories you have of your father. Especially the humorous things he said or did. Think on how your father would want you to handle this most difficult period of planning for a funeral or memorial. If you can reach out to offer comfort to your dads special friends or your family members. They will be thankful for your kind attention and some amount of comfort may well come to you. You have a difficult time ahead. It will gradually get better.  If you are a person of faith may that sustain you.
I am so sorry for your loss. Losing your father is one of the hardest things to happen in your life. Give yourself time to grieve. Cherish the memories.
My deepest condolences to you. Sometimes what I have found to help is to write about some good memories that you shared together, it can be a way to process the feelings and also consolidate those memories even more. Wish you all the best in these trying times.
I'm thinking about you, OP. My dad passed a little under two months ago after a similar timeframe with Alzheimer's. I still go through a lot of the same emotions you are talking about. When you feel you can, maybe find some photos or videos of happier times. My struggle is that all my memories are about the past few years of his disease and how painful they were. I'm trying to replace those memories with the ones of him when he wasn't sick but I know that will take time. We are all here for you, OP. Hang in there, reach out to your friends.
Nobody can tell you how to fill the void this grief created. What we can offer you are some thoughts to help you navigate.  When you feel that list most keenly, remind yourself how much he lived you and how he would want you to be ok; to be able to make your life the best it can be as a testament of his love for you. That is one way to honor his memory and keep him with you.
So terribly sorry for you OP. Your dad sounds like he was a wonderful man and father. You are so young and have had to carry a heavy burden. Sending you strength. It will take a long time but it will get easier eventually.
Saying a prayer for you OP! Mucho amor coming your way
I am so sorry for your unbelievably difficult loss. I totally understand how you feel. And while nothing anyone says will make anything better right now, know that there are people who love you and who won’t stop thinking about you, even when you think everyone else has moved on. I lost my dad suddenly about 4 months ago and while the pain is still very real, the happy memories are coming in stronger now than the grief. Be easy on yourself and know you’re loved!
My dad (71) just got diagnosed and my mom has been dead for over 10 years, and I am 25. We could all use some support. I'm so sorry that this happened and it must've been a very shitty journey, but his suffering is over and you can begin the healing process and move on to better things.
I’m so sorry for your loss.  It’s hard because the man you knew as ‘dad’ has been gone a while but his body lingered.  It’s a cruel disease. Maybe find a local support group to go to? & continue to post here. We get it",2022-01-20 22:49:15,itsnika_x,s91ah6
Alzheimers,"Help please, need to get Dad some support, mom’s memory is not good","Hello, sadly my mom’s memory is going quickly. We are awaiting official diagnosis but early onset Alzheimer’s is here. He’s trapped in her head, he goes to store, she freaks cause he’s gone and she can’t remember where. Was thinking of one of those google home things. My thought is she could ask… “Where’s Bob?” And it would say he’s at appointment etc. is this possible with google calendar? Thanks","She will need someone with her if your dad is gone. We never had success showing my dad something new. There is no way he would know to ask a speaker where his wife is. We split up care between my mom, brother and myself. 

And for safety reasons she shouldn't be left alone.
I agree that new technology doesn't work well with dementia people. Keep it simple. Have your Dad write down the time, where he is, and when he'll be back (I always add on an extra 30 minutes in case I'm late to avoid a freak out). The trick is to place it in a reliable place that she will see it.
Why don't you call your local agency on aging?  It sounds like your dad needs some help - they have all kinds of resources from in-home aids to adult daycare to really anything.  I don't know that she would remember to ask Google Home - unfortunately it sounds like she can't be left alone.
hi! my mother is the same, we have a whiteboard in my kitchen that sits on the counter and it includes everything she has to know. my mom is alone some days and this really helps her with getting her own routine for the day going. we even decorate it with flowers and fun colors because she likes them. 

on the board we write the date month year and a couple of things she has to do that day. if any of us are leaving we write it in big letters on the board where we're going and when we'll be back

hope this helps OP💖",2022-01-20 22:14:25,manonc13,s90lvr
Alzheimers,How do you know when it ends and at what point do you stop?,"My girlfriend’s grandma has had alzheimers for 10 years with the last five plus years having no mobility or speach. Everyday she is cared for in such an incredible way that she manages to continue to survive. Her grandma can still manage to kinda swallow enough to eat and she still opens her eyes and makes completley incoherent mumbles but can sometimes make eye contact. She is now about 50lbs and she was 76lbs a year ago. Her circulation has been really bad lately and her feet were swollen, after medication the swelling is down but her toes are starting to turn black. My question is how do you know when the time is over? How and can you make the call to end suffering? Is she suffering? Are people with alzheimers understanding of their condition in regards to pain? Seems like a tough questions but everywhere on google says that she probably should have passed 8 years ago, but due to the immense ammount of care she recieves that hasnt been the case.","God we should have a better understanding of end-of-life issues by now.  I wish there was a legit way to say if someone’s “done” and be able to relieve their suffering.  Although it’s hard to say if they’re suffering, and people would take so much advantage of this and do pretty crappy things.  I hate this disease so much.  I hope you and your family find some peace with it.
Get hospice involved.  They are very knowledgeable and very helpful.
Honestly, if sounds like the time to quit was a while ago. At some point patients need to get 'lucky' and catch pneumonia or an infection so they can be let go, or there's nothing left but waiting till the bitter end. 

What you are describing sounds like the bitter end to me. Very low quality of life, and barely any consciousness to speak off. However, the outside view is always easier. There's a reason family has decided to hang on this long, and sharing your personal opinion will likely not go over well.
I’m so sorry. This is my future terror with my mom. I wish I had the words for this, but we can only pray for something swift and merciful at this stage like a stroke or heart attack. I’m so profoundly sorry, OP.
Wow no mobility for 5 years...my mom is at almost 15 months now, and about 16 years with dementia at first notice. It's been over 5 years at stage 7 though and yes It's hard to know. Her doctor put her on hospice almost 2 years ago and recently removed her because her condition is still ""stable"" even though she is much worse than she was anytime in 2020. Her body is completely paralyzed and doesn't even open her eyes anymore with swelling and sore skin as a common occupation now. This whole process is awful and frustrating for everyone who has to live through it.
She needs Hospice care.
Several of the markers for involve hospice are: drastic weight loss, shrinking circumference of the arm, decreasing ability to swallow, very few distinct words, inability to sit up, smile, or hold her head up.
Shes been on hospice for a majority of this process over five years.
Different states have different rules, including easing death when it seems the right thing to do.  In WA, I think, a family may apply to run a ""small care home"" and use extra bedrooms with maybe four affected people who can begin to feel as if they have family right there.  Prices vary quite a bit and I think were not bad in small WA homes.  It is criminal to trap young people in this kind of caregiving.  They are quite welcome to VISIT their loved ones in care homes.  Look up [medicare.gov](https://medicare.gov) and find ""aging"" for a list of actual care homes in the area.  You can try something out, and change your mind later.  In fact, the aging person will probably be happier (think toast and coffee at breakfast in the kitchen, watching the pets in the courtyard, a long nap, the evening news, and an early bed time) than he would be in his own house.",2022-01-20 18:45:33,Moist-Village7699,s8wb7y

Alzheimers,First time away.,"Next weekend I’m going on holiday for three nights. First time being away from grandma since she was diagnosed 3/4 years ago. I seem to be writing overly extensive notes to the person who’s standing in for me. (Do “A” if she says this but “B” if she doesn’t unless “C” happens etc)…
Gran seems to perk up a bit when someone else is around. You can tell she tries harder to be “normal”.
So my question is. Should I give the person who is standing in all the notes and stick to the structure? Or do you think that tearing them them up and making grandma work a little harder for a few days with a different routine be better?

Edit: grammar.","I don't know as it makes any difference.  Provide the notes but be aware person  might not even read them, let alone act on them.  Just relax and enjoy your holiday.
I'd write the notes as I wouldn't relax otherwise and that's exactly what you need to do. It's on the other person if they choose to freestyle. Have a great break.
I struggle with this too. I have 3 pages typed up and debating on whether to give them to the new 8 hours a week caregiver.",2022-01-20 13:04:54,Bolehillbilly,s8p0hi
Alzheimers,Occasional Professional Care - What is the profession name?,"Hi, currently I have a grandma that is suffering from Alzheimer.

The progression has luckily been very slow, but it's starting to get to a serious point of day to day memory loss, no short term memory, confusing and mixing facts together.

We have a full time carer and mom has sometimes to go at night and help her out. Grandpa just broke his femur so he can't help much.

I was wondering if there is a professional figure I could pay to go to her and soothe her / improve her mental state, anything that can help in that sense. What would this be called?  


Also any books you would recommend that I could give my mom / grandpa on ""how to live with someone that has alzheimer""? I just realised no one in the family is really informed on anything and we're just going with the motions. Surely some knowledge wouldn't hurt.","Hi OP; does the fulltime caregiver not do this stuff? When we hired help (basically just to babysit my dad), it was called companion care as they were not there to do much feeding, dressing, toileting. Really just there to keep him company
There is a free book online that I recommend: “Understanding the dementia experience” by Jennifer Ghent Fuller. This should help them in knowing how to communicate with her to avoid upset and to soothe it. Another good book available on Amazon is “The 36 hour Day”.",2022-01-20 08:54:09,IntoTheUnknownWorld,s8jijs
Alzheimers,"I don’t know where to start, my Dad has Alzheimers (not officially diagnosed) and I don’t know what to do.","Sorry if this is all over the place but I just wanted to seek some help from the community. Will try to give as much context and background as i can.

My Dad (73) probably has Alzheimers. My Grandma had it and passed away from it, he is displaying symptoms for the past year as I understand. At this stage, he remembers the larger things like who I am, who my mom is etc but he forgets everyday events like what he ate, any plans we discuss for the day and he will repeat the same story that he has already told us. He is also angry most of the day. He will shout at my mom over the most trivial things and asks her to kill him so she can get rid of him. He doesn’t want to go and meet anyone outside the house (refused to go to another city to meet his daughters and grand kids and his own sisters and brothers). He still wants to drive even though he really can’t. He handles all his finances and makes poor investment decisions and doesn’t tell us until after. If we ask him to stop driving or stop handling his own finances he gets furious. He has a very specific daily routine and he does not stray from it. 

I live in another country, along with my wife, and at home it’s just my mom (68) and my Dad plus one of my sisters (29) who works full time and lives with our parents. 

I know that the first step should be to have him diagnosed so we know which stage he is at and how to care for him but he refuses to see a doctor and have any tests done. I’m currently visiting my parents and took a career break for the past 2 months to be close to him and get him help and help out mom. Tried taking him to the doctor but he fought with me and it got ugly. Without an official diagnosis I suspect everything else will be difficult ie treatment but he’s stubborn and I can’t get him medical help without his consent.

My parents live in a country which is not very developed, is conservative and they are very religious. I mention this because talking about this type of a disease is taboo here. I was too young at the time but as far as I recall no one talked about my grandma’s condition and she got limited medical help. My mom was her caretaker and I don’t want her to go through that experience again with my Dad. My sister also cannot be the caretaker as she is likely to be married in the next year and will move out. There is no concept of nursing homes in my country so my dad will live at home. I want to care for him but that means both me and my wife give up our life and move back home. I’m not sure I can ask her to do that. I can afford to hire help at home but worry that Dad will get angry at them and make them leave. 

My mom has experience with this from my grandma’s time but she doesn’t want to talk about a structured way of helping Dad. She does not want to treat him like a patient (probably scared and hence in denial).

What do I do and where do I start? How will his disease progress and what can I expect? How do I make him happy and care for him?","First, use your mother's increasing age as a reason for her to hire a ""housekeeper.""  This person should actually have experience with caregiving for seniors and people with dementia, but will appear to your father as a benign aide to your poor aging mother.

This alone is going to lessen her burden hugely.

Next, since dad's denial is so strong, work around it, not against it.  If he talks about wanting to kill himself or be killed, this is an expression of despair and self-loathing.  He should be comforted and cajoled.  No one should remind him that he has asked the same question twice or told the same story earlier in the day.  Efforts should be made to make the home atmosphere pleasing - and yet unchallenging - to him.  Pleasant music, flowers, and favorite foods should be offered.

Regarding finances, it's a good idea if  your mother arranges to have a financial consultant come into the house to ""help her understand her old-age planning.""  At least she will have a clear sense of what money is where, and the tax consequences.  This person can explain the situation should she die first, and should he die first.  (Never even mentioning the apparent mental decline.)  Also, a lawyer should be brought in to discuss the proper documents needed by an aging couple.  This would include medical proxy, powers of attorney, etc.  If a will is not in place, then his and her wills should be written.  All this is ""to help mother feel less anxiety about getting older.""  Call it an estate plan.

It's actually a good idea to do this before anyone diagnoses your dad, because after he is diagnosed, his judgment can be challenged, say by a relative who wants to inherit or to handle his disease differently.  But as of today, he has no dementia, at least none documented.

Regarding driving, his refusal to leave home (probably because he doubts his ability to navigate the world) may make it easy to withhold the means of driving.  Some people hide the car keys, or sell the vehicle.  I agree he should be kept from driving.

I hope this will give you some ideas how to gradually and diplomatically take more control of the situation, while making your father feel he is appropriately providing for your mother's needs.  If his sense of worth is being upheld, he may gradually allow himself to be taken care of, more and more.

In my own household, I have used my spouse's own mistakes as a reason to impose changes.  Regarding driving, he was told by two different doctors that he should give up driving.  He misbehaved in a senior exercise class we went to, and I used this as a reason he needed to stop going to it.   He has had a few elopements, and I use this as a reason to continue to get help from a geriatrics clinic.  He wants to feel helpful, so he has tried to do laundry, load the dishwasher, make coffee, with bad results each time; so I remind him what has happened in the past, and ask him to leave it be and I'll handle it.  Etc.

I hope this gave you some ideas.  Good luck.  It's a painful time for everyone, but it can be managed with some knowledge and patience.
Is there anyone who is a member of their church who you could speak to to act as some kind of liaison to get community help? It’s hard to offer advice not living in a country with similar culture.  If I make the assumption that your family has lived there for generations, you may be able to reach out to extended family for help, but maybe that is not an option for you. 

Before you assume that your wife would not be open to it, ask her. She may think about it quite differently than what you are guessing she would. An open and honest conversation would likely be best. If indeed that turns out not to be something you or she can do (or want to do), you will have to seek other options.

As to what to expect, just read through posts on this subreddit. It can be all over the board, and progress fast or slow—it just depends on his particular health outlook, his underlying personality traits, etc. An accurate diagnosis would be a good first step. I’m sorry you are dealing with a complicated set of circumstances.

Alzheimers,"Probably been asked a billion and a half times on here, but what's the best way to respond when they start forgetting who you are?","We're not there yet, but I wanna be ahead of the curve. I feel like if she asks, responding with ""I'm your grandson"" would make her feel really crappy for forgetting such a thing, but I can't imagine lying would be the right response either. She hates being patronized in general so I don't know how to best navigate that transitional period where she's starting to get bad, but not yet bad enough that she can't recognize her own decline.","It depends. I didn’t realize Mom didn’t really know me. She loved me and recognized me as hers always. One day just before Mother’s Day she asked who my mother was. Without thinking, I said you. We laughed and quickly moved on. Later that evening we were alone and she started to cry. She said something like “What kind of mother would forget their child?”  She was just crushed. From that day to the last few days of her life I called her by her first name. I told her mine, but never again mentioned that I was her daughter. The week before she passed she knew me and I called her Mom all the time. You will just have to play it by ear. Does she know you, but not your name?  Or has she forgotten she was ever a mother?  I knew when Mom was remembering herself as a child that having a daughter wouldn’t make sense. If she called me Mom or by a sister’s name I went along with it. It’s hard. You are being smart trying to prepare. I did that as well and I think it helped both me and her.
I always just told my Nan that I’m “first name” and tried to quickly move her on to the next topic or activity. She always managed to remember that I was a safe person which I was grateful for. I know it can be a shock but try to take a deep breath when it happens and stay upbeat, don’t draw too much attention to the slip up. She’s noticed, you’ve noticed, it won’t make any difference to draw attention to it.
Each time I walked into her room I always said in the same sing-songy way, ""Hi Mom, It's Bonkette!"" After a while it was the way I said it each time that resonated rather than what I said. 

I have not been able to visit due to pandemic and I am sure she has absolutely forgotten who I am by now but for the period where she still had the ability to recognize people, I was someone she knew from somewhere and it helped.
Maybe just use your first name or a nickname she is familiar with. I agree that putting her in a position that highlights her decline might make her feel bad. In my MIL's case she didn't recognize my husband as her son but when she heard his name she was able to understand a bit better.

I don't know where your grandmother is regarding her disease but perhaps you could get a hoodie or a T shirt with your first name on the back. Something like a team shirt with the logo on the front and your name on the back? In the future she might more easily make the connection between you and your name (and possibly your relationship) by reading it rather than hearing it.
I worried constantly that would happen and thankfully it didn't.
I'm sorry but I do not have an answer.
I try to talk first - like ""hi dad!"", just as I do with all other things that he forgets. Like ""oh it was really difficult to get here huh? Now let's find that hammer/brush/cattoy/whatever you were looking for!"" 

I remind him before he has ti realise that he had forgotten about it and if he forgets anyways I just joke around it or change subject.
Like other responses here, referring to yourself by name and conveying a safe and loving demeanor is what is important. Mom is/was bilingual, so we always thought that introducing more words in the statement, ""it's me, [name], your daughter"" added another layer of confusion. Because mom now has to remember name, and then what ""daughter"" meant in relation to that name. Before things got to her current, final stage, she would repeat the word she couldn't recall, ""daughter... daughter..."" like she was trying to recall from a mental dictionary.

The more we encountered ""conversations"" like these, the more it became apparent that trying to provide context clues only added to the confusion and subsequent agitation. 

It's your face and voice that are most important. Words and meaning will be eaten by the disease, but emotions remain. The rest of the work on your end will be mentally and emotionally preparing yourself for the gradual loss on your end.",2022-01-18 21:26:07,Squid8867,s7f0gh

Alzheimers,Changes.,"I can’t hide how jarring it is when dad says something indicative of him slipping away. It might come out of the blue when he’s had a good day or week. How do I keep it together when he says something that shows he’s losing his grasp on things? He’s also becoming fixated on my visits and asking my mother when he’ll see me again. Despite speaking 5 or 6 times every day and frequently for an hour every evening (either on FaceTime or on the Portal TV) I still have a sickening feeling that I should be with him all of the time when I know that even if lived locally, I would need to work and couldn’t be with him, all of the time. I see him for 5 days at a time every three weeks or so, is that enough? He doesn’t need caring for as such right now and my mother is more than capable to help him out with the small stuff he does need a hand with, it’s more the behavioural changes that are so brutally painful to stomach right now.","My SO is suffering with Alzheimer's. It has been almost four years since I recognized the first signs of mental deterioration. She works hard to remain useful, but many of her skills have eroded. It sneaks up on me emotionally when she hits a wall while trying and failing at another simple task. 

But I am there for her 24/7. Sometimes I see her almost frozen, and I know that she doesn't know what she needs to do. 

I must stay strong, she will need me for years.
First I'm really sorry for what your family is going through.  It's hard and it's good to reach out for advice.

My advice: Don't focus on the bad, focus on the good!  Accentuate the good things in your memory, hold onto them and cherish them.  Make recording of your conversations, write good memories down and just enjoy what you've got!

Do your best to spend time quality with him when you can.

Take it from someone with regrets here.  I wish I had taken more time to hold on then because I didn't know how bad it could get later.  You just can't know how it's going to go or how long it's going to take.  I wish my dad could give me advice one more time.  I just wish he'd say my name again.

One of the things I have that I cherish more than anything is back before things were really bad my dad was outside and I was videoing him and he looks up and sees me and just smiles the best smile.    I wish I'd have had the foresight back then to just record everything I could.

It's not easy. You just keep doing the best you can.

*Also remember how hard this must be on your mother.  She's going to need support and understanding too.  My mom has been changed so much by all the trauma and since covid happened all the support groups in the area shut down.  It's been miserable and isolating to a family that's already isolated because of a difficult caregiving situation.  Be there for her too and make sure she's ok.

Alzheimers,I feel like my dad is holding my mom hostage,"I'm not really asking for advice this time. I'm just venting.

Woke us up around 3am shouting about coffee. Time has no meaning to him anymore. The day starts when he wakes up, ends when he goes to bed, regardless of what time it actually is. And he expects everyone else to be up with him.

He was out of coffee. Yelling at my mom about how he's ""constantly getting the short end of the stick"" because he's convinced he's the victim. He's convinced that she's depriving him of things on purpose. He's out of coffee because he drinks too much. 

3am to about 430am. 

Eventually he stopped shouting. He's angry anymore. At least no worse than usual. But he keeps waking her up. Going into her room (they've had separate bedrooms for years) and keeps bothering her about stupid petty shit. 

My poor mother is sleep deprived. Depressed and anxious from being yelled at all the time. And anytime she tries to leave the house, even for just a few hours, he'll call her over 20 times. Making up reasons to yell at her or leave angry messages when she doesn't pick up. Or, he'll get in a car and drive around trying to find her. 

We can't stop him from driving. Tried. 

This type of thing has become the new normal. Practically a daily thing.

I feel so bad for her. He was an asshole long before the disease took over. It's hard to feel sorry for him or to have any sympathy when he's always been a loud, selfish, raging asshole. But the disease amplified the worst of him then times over. And now he's this abusive burden we're stuck with. 

Can't afford to put him in a home. He's not far enough along to qualify for it anyway. Plus they'd prob kick him out for being an asshole. And we can't afford to move out and just abandon him. (my mom's guilt would never let her go through with that though)

If things keep going the way that they are, I'm convinced she'll kill herself just to get away from him.","I am so sorry. My father was a similarly angry/abusive personality, and I understand how difficult it is to have a dominating personality like that in your home. 

Can you surreptitiously switch him to decaf? Keep the can of the old caffeinated version when it’s empty and replace the contents with decaf? It might at least help you and your mom get some sleep (which is critical for handling the trauma you are both being put through).

You and your mom need to team up as best you can to help you both cope. What other small, undetectable changes could you two partner up on that would help you both to deal with this difficult personality? Are there other dietary elements that may be intensifying his unpleasant personality, like sugar, processed foods? I’m not saying that any of this would wholesale change his personality, but it might help to lessen his more intense outbursts, and allow you and your mom some breathing room at the very least.

Again, so sorry for what your family is having to endure. If you haven’t already, see about looking into some support for you both. If you are in the US, the Area Agency on Aging may be able to get you some help. You are truly both in an untenable situation. Don’t delay trying to get some support. Worried about you and your mom.
Wow, that sounds horrible for your mom, and for you.  I don't have any solutions, just heartfelt sympathy.
I'm so sorry, OP. I really feel for you. Dementia is the absolute worst. It is so cruel and incredibly unfair. Just sending you my thoughts and sympathy. I'm sorry.
Seroquel has saved my sanity and health. My wife was getting up at all hours and during the day was in constant motion. 1/2 a pill in the morning and 1/2 at night. Talk to his doc. I put it in a mini snickers at night.
I am sorry you have to go thru this. Sounds so hard.
I sympathize. I think there comes a time that you have to admit defeat. Your mom needs to realize she's done all she can, and it's okay to admit it's too much.

My mom turned into a raging beast in the mid-stages of Alzheimer's. She became physically abusive, in addition to mentally, and it was shocking as she'd never been that mean before. We went through all the recommended meds. I want to say it started with Zoloft, as she started having panic attacks, they tried Ativan. Those helped for a few months, but then she started attacking others. She got into a fight with a guy over what she felt was a theft, and she broke her wrist attacking him. That led to Zyprexa. That didn't help at all, so Seroquel was next. She attacked another and tried to slam that woman's head into a brick wall. She sprained a nurse's wrist and attacked paramedics who were called to help. That led to her going onto the highest possible dose of Seroquel. That did nothing, so she was hospitalized in the psychiatry ward. The only thing they found that helped were Haldol injections. But that required 24/7 nursing in the peak of the pandemic. Our visitations to her were limited for that reason. It also gave me the chance to step back and let the professionals take over. 

If your mom feels that your dad is a danger to herself and others, verbal abuse can very quickly turn physical, doctors will follow through and help.

And this is where your mom needs to consider this. I was depressed. I had also put off seeing my own doctor for five years in the midst of all this. Turned out I was extremely anemic. I just finished the last of dozens of blood tests and scans to figure out the cause of the anemia. They've found nothing. But, I am feeling stronger every day. I'm happier. I've shed 50 pounds as I have some energy to actually put towards myself. My self-esteem is improving. I decided to take online classes to get certified in a few things. I feel that I have a purpose that isn't just being the one to be there for my mom 24/7.
>We can't stop him from driving. Tried. 

Some one suggested that you get the officials to take away his license. That way he can be mad at them and not your mother.

I still feel bad for stealing the car keys from Mum. But for her safety and others on the roads, it had to be done. 

I'm sorry. This is so hard on you all.
I hate that for your mom and family. I hope this is resolved soon. ❤️
You are doing the right thing, bro.",2022-01-14 11:42:41,kappakingtut2,s3wpsh
Alzheimers,Brother taking me to court for guardianship of elderly father,"Tl;dr my father (87) diagnosed with dementia Alzheimer’s currently lives at home, I am his caretaker. I have durable PoA, medical PoA, and so on. He wants to move to VA with me, where I live full time. My brother is now taking me to court for guardianship though he rarely visited my parents before they got Covid and I came to help. Can I fight this in court?

My mom and dad both came down with Covid in November of last year. They ended up so bad that my mom fell onto the floor and since my dad is so deaf when he takes out his hearing aids he didn’t find her until the next morning. He was so weak he could not get her up, so he called my brother to come help. He had to break in to do so, and mom ended up in icu in the end and passing away. Dad ended up that same week in the hospital for a week as well. He fortunately made it through. 

Now, at the time I lived in Virginia and had called my brother and told him that mom and dad were very sick, sicker than they had ever been in their lives and he needed to go check on them. He never checked once. He lives 11 minutes away from their house! My eldest son was getting married that week but I would have missed the wedding if I knew how serious it was. 
He called them every day, left messages every day, but I would think that the fact that they never answered the phone, knowing they were sick, he would have come over to see what was up. But yet, not once.

Fast forward to when I got here, mom and dad were in the hospital and mom told me to go to the bank and get paperwork done so I could pay the bills as they had not done that in November, being sick . So I did that and they both signed it, after I explained to both of them what it was. Them being sick I just wanted to make sure they understood. I had to have dad talk to the bank associate so he could acknowledge what was going on.

Moving forward dad is home, mom has passed away and with dad’s diagnosis, according to moms will I am her executrix, so I have a durable Power of Attorney, and Medical Power of Attorney made up as well. I have Notary come over to the house so he doesn’t have to go out and it is signed by witnesses and the notary, depending on what is needed for each form.

Moving forward again, I’m going through the house my folks lived in for 50 years, getting rid of ancient paperwork, old childhood stuff, just crap that is not necessary or needed. My nephew comes over and his kids start grabbing stuff of my moms and wanting to take it home some without asking. Now my mom was very organized, and had taken me on “ death walks” through the house for years, telling me who got what when they were gone, she labeled stuff on the  bottom so I would know who get it. And here comes a 15, 12, and 10 year old just grabbing shit. I was upset. 

So, I’m having to take my dad to the doctor for a checkup after getting out of the hospital, my brother comes along, ok whatever, I could have called you with the results. A month later dad seems to be having an UTI so I make an appointment and I go, my brother tags along again. At my request, they do some tests for dementia as my brother has stated that he has doubts dad has it, he never heard mom talk about it and he feels dad just has Covid fog.  He has also stated since mom died that since she is gone her words have no weight anymore. So they do the test and the doc states he does have dementia just like his file already shows, it doesn’t get better or go away. That he cannot live alone.

Somebody in the family has now filed a DHS report on me stating I was under medicating him (did not pick up a prescription of prednisone at the pharmacy, shock and awe, I have the receipt, the bottle and so forth), that I am over medicating him ( he has a tree nut allergy, and he got into something with tree nuts, so I asked the pharmacist what was the best thing for him, he told me Benadryl. Now know this might not be true, and am calling my allergist!), and that I was using his money  myself (please, that is ridicules, my dad has so little money, and when I mentioned I found cash in a lockbox, my brother kept hammering me how much was it. I told him it didn’t matter as I put it back in his savings.

Today I was served with papers that said I need to be in court in Feb as my brother is filing for guardianship over dad. He wants to put dad in a nursing home, whereas I can provide him a home with family, an entire home, his own room, 3 porches, home cooked food, and so forth. He can save his money for later when he needs memory care.

On top of that, with guardianship comes finical responsibility of dad. My brother and his wife have not filed taxes in three years. Their home cannot pass inspection to get insurance and they refuse to fix it to get insurance. His wife is on the state child abuse and adult dependent registries, for child abuse against my niece. My brother smokes weed at home, at work, and in his vehicles. I don’t normally have an issue with weed, but don’t smoke it at your place of employment unless your boss is super chill lol and yea I’m going to use it against him when it comes to protecting my dad from him.

Present times: my dad is upset that my brother never talked to him, made false allegations and so forth. Dad was appointed some random lawyer from a different town, he has a lawyer just down the street he has used for years.

What can I legally? Can I file the same paperwork or just present my facts in court that day? Can he be made to do a drug test?

If you read all of this, thank you, if you have advice, thank you!","Definitely fight this....get the lawyer from down the street to tell you your options or to be your lawyer since he knows your parents' history.   It is clear from this information that the brother is in it for the money, and not care and concern.  It will be hard, but you can't give in.  Stay strong.
Families can be so ugly when this kind of thing happens, I'm watching it within my own.

I think you need an attorney, like yesterday. One that specializes in elder care law.

My best wishes to you and your dad.
In a few words they are aiming for the money. I bet the moment they get legal control they sell house, throw stuff out, put your father in a nursing home, spend all the money and force you to take him when they can't afford it.

Lawyer up now, I'm sorry, but your brother and wife are a piece of shit.
I’d suggest you get your own lawyer in that state.  My brother and I together got guardianship of my mother and grandmother.  Our lawyer drew up the paperwork and put it through the courts.  The court appointed an ad litem for each of them who made sure everything was on the up and up.  Your lawyer should advocate for you and your dad and make sure the court knows of your brother’s life situation.  I’m sure the court will see through his effort.
First of all, your Dad needs to be considered incapacitated and unable to manage any of his affairs in order for a guardian to be appointed. A dementia diagnosis alone is not enough to qualify for guardianship. This will be determined by a doctor. 
Second, rather than your brother being appointed guardian, it is more likely the judge will appoint a third party, such as a professional guardian, because of the disputes between you and your brother. Guardianship court isn’t fond of that. What your Dad wants, as communicated by what he currently says and who he appointed as POA when he was of sound mind, does matter a lot. However, it sounds like you got him to sign the POA documents after the initial dementia diagnosis and the way you went about it (at home with no attorney) is not ideal. When you do a POA with an estate attorney, that attorney is confirming that the person has testamentary capacity (enough cognitive capacity to understand wills and associated docs). This matters to judges. But you don’t have that. 
Is your Dad’s longtime attorney an elder law attorney? If so, it would be worth it to consult with him on your Dad’s behalf (and yours). Don’t expect to go to court and have a forum for explaining things to the judge and “making your case”.  It’s likely going to be brief and the judge will be utilizing information gathered by the attorneys. What’s important is the information you provide to the representative assigned by the court. Try to stick to the facts. 
Why do you think your brother is doing this? Are there substantial assets he wants to control? Why would he want your Dad in a nursing home instead of at home?  Be forewarned, if a professional guardian is assigned, that person will do the easiest and most expedient thing which is usually a facility. They’ll sell the house to pay for it, if it belongs solely to him. Assets will disappear quickly and the guardian even determines who can visit your Dad. Not getting along, could very well bite you and your brother in the butt. But my fingers are crossed that you prevail. If you want to do everything possible (I would) talk to a certified elder law attorney (CELA) right away.
Agreeing with everyone else here:  don't try to do this alone, get legal representation.  I think you're going to win, but without a lawyer it could very easily go the other way.  I'm sorry for the loss of your mother.  Sounds like you will give dad a very cozy circumstance for the early stages of the disease.

On another note, I've heard from several sources that people with dementia should never take Benadryl or any other antihistamine.  Not sure what it does but acts on the brain in a bad way for people with dementia.
I am sorry are having to go through this! Sadly nothing brings out the worst in people like illness and estate stuff. 

If you don't already have one get an atty to come with you to the hearing and present your case that you are the better Guardian. You already have the paperwork and have clearly been doing it so let the facts speak for themselves.
Sounds like you should have a strong case in court. I recommend finding your own lawyer you trust or the one your dad trusts. Talk it out with them first and find out what evidence you should gather. Maybe also post on r/legaladvice
Waa, kittykathazard, what a rollercoaster, so very sorry for you losing your mom, and all the troubles!   I don't have any legal advice, I'm even across the Pacific Ocean in different country, but I feel for you!!  

I was far away across the world when my mums dementia was coming on, my pos sister here was neglecting & scamming her so badly, I went ballistic when I returned to find out what the heck was going on here - so completely shocked, just wanted to vomit for days & knock sisters head off.  Called my bro in from interstate to fix a few things up, but it's been nothing but trouble from the evil sister - she has unaddressed mental health issues, and her primary motive is only all about tHe mOneY, and tHe hoUse, which she wants & thinks she's entitled to.   So yeh, we had endless rounds of doctors, lawyers, DomViolence orgs, elder abuse orgs, Alzheimers Australia, Dementia Australia, ElderCare, etc etc when all I wanted to do was focus on keeping mum having a pleasant & good quality life.   grrrrrr these selfish pos family members make my blood boil - I feel ya! 

I hope you get the best lawyer for yr dad & yrself, and yr horrid bro's case will be tossed out the window asap.  I don't know if you should photograph yr dads place before the grubby-handed kids sneak or wreck treasured items? Idk....   I hope you can sort it all out & go back to your place with yr dad asap.     .... Best of luck!
I'm sorry your brother is putting you and your dad through this. The best thing is to find a lawyer and fight this. You want what is best and I hope the judge will rule in your favor
First I'm so sorry you are going through any of this. 

My advise is to get an attorney ASAP and fight this. Nursing homes are a necessary thing as not everyone has family who can care for them or any family at all. The quality of nursing homes can vary wildly. 

I've lost both parents to Dementia/Alzheimer's in the last two years and it is an awful disease. I can not fortunate enough to have been able to keep them at home. My mom was in a great nursing home and they did a wonderful job of caring for her. I felt that she was actually loved but some of her caregivers. My dad ended up at a horrible place and I wouldn't say he was abused but he wasn't cared for at anywhere close to the level my mom was. 

I tried and tried to get him into another place but it was too late. I'm my heart I do hold some blame for his rapid decline on them but what can I do now? 

Fight to keep him with you as hard as you can. He's a lucky man to have you.",2022-01-13 16:11:34,kittykathazzard,s39ryk
Alzheimers,Talking on the phone with my mid-late stage grandmother,"I live about a 3 hour flight from my grandparents, so I only see them a few times a year, but I call every 2-3 days. The calls have gotten harder recently. She’s always pleasant and upbeat, but she can’t answer any questions or tell me much of anything. She repeatedly asks me when is the next time I’m visiting. Usually I say I’ll be there very soon and I can’t wait to see her. Then she asks again when it’ll be, I’ll give an exact date and tell her I’m excited to cook with her, take her to the library, or something new. Then she’ll just keep asking. I’m not sure if there’s an answer that would satisfy her. When I call even the day after a visit, she’ll say it’s been a long time since she’s seen me. I just apologize and say I can’t wait for the next time. And the cycle continues.

Sometimes she tells me she was just reading a book so I’ll ask her about the book and she can’t tell me anything else, so we talk about how wonderful reading is. She likes music and dancing, but these don’t translate over the phone as well. In person, I can get her to tell stories about her childhood but I have trouble engaging her over the phone. Sometimes I’ll just ramble about my day or my life and if I laugh, she laughs too. Eventually she gets tired of talking or listening and I can hear her trying to pass the phone to my grandpa. Every time, I hear him respond “say goodbye first”. Then I tell her I love her and she says it back. I’m not sure she even knows who I am during these calls. 

tldr- I have a phone routine with my grandma and I’m not sure what I can do to make it better. Alzheimer’s sucks","With the friend I posted about a few days ago, I lean into the repetition rather than trying to move the conversation along in a conventional linear trajectory. I’ll deliberately return to topics that I know engage him after only a 5-10 minute interval since he’ll enjoy them afresh, and I answer repeated questions every time he asks. I also largely avoid asking material questions, since he struggles to answer them; I just make statements with little questions at the end, like “That view sure is beautiful today, isn’t it?” (knowing that he loves the view and can talk about it). We’re more people enjoying agreement than people catching up.  That may feel especially weird on the phone, but it’s still worth a try; the idea is reframing the conversation into a new model she can succeed at and enjoy.
Getting towards late stage it might not be that the answer doesn't satisfy her, she might not remember from one minute to the next that she even asked that question already. My dad is in pretty much the same place, I don't try to have linear conversions with him anymore. I visit a couple times a week and we have a few conversations over and over again, sometimes the same conversation two or three times in an hour. I just keep telling him about my job, about where I live now, about all the things as if I didn't just say it 20 minutes before. It's awful.

Edited to add - how to make it better, that's a hard question. Alzheimer’s is brutal. The only thing I've done to make them better is to stop expecting that he's going to respond with anything that makes sense, or that he'll remember that we already talked about whatever it is, or that we even talked at all. I try to keep things light, and don't try to keep him focused. We talk about the weather a lot, crazy drivers, people he still remembers though that list is rapidly shrinking.
my mom has vascular dementia . I really don‘t talk with her on the phone anymore . she would say hello all cheery like and talk for a minute or two. Then she would tell me she had to use the toilet and said goodbye . I know she would use this excuse on her sister , who could talk your ear off, to get off the phone. I am sure she is just confused about the phone and maybe doesn’t really know who I am over the phone. It hurts to not talk with her and I live several states away. I’m sorry you are dealing with this .Sad to say It will just get worse . I feel I have already lost my mom. Even when I was able to visit her ,before all this covid shit, she kept repeating herself. Just be happy to hear her voice and try to and be patient . The good news is if you run out of things to talk about you can repeat them yourself since she probably wont notice.
Yes, you have described it very well. That's the same experience I've had and what I've witnessed in others with dementia.  I live with my Dad who has dementia so I see the ""behind the scenes"" of this. Conversation is a struggle - both coming up with things to say and following what someone else is saying. I often prep him before calls and visits about who the person is and some things he can say. Sometimes I will even write down or give him a question to ask while he's on the phone. He appreciates the help and acknowledges sometimes to me before a visit or call that he's not sure what to say and also that he wasn't following what was said. He is happy when he can contribute to the conversation by repeating a story or opinion he knows well (that everyone has heard a million times). The ""When are you going to visit?"" is an example of that with certain people - something to fall back on conversationally (in addition to not remembering past visits etc..).  I do think your grandma enjoys the conversation more than you think because she's not aware of all the ways it's not a normal or ideal conversation (that she's repeating, etc.). It might be sucking for you but not for her - and knowing that may make it not suck for you! My Dad enjoys conversations even when he's not sure who the person is or what they're really talking about - he just knows it's someone enthusiastic and animated that is giving him a lot of attention. Aside from avoiding too many open-ended questions that might put her on the spot of answering when she may not be able to, I say to just keep on doing what you are doing. Talk about the same thing over and over if she enjoys the topic or just happily blab about some stuff so she can listen. Tell her whatever pleases her like ""I'm going to visit soon. I can't wait."" 

tldr: I think you're doing everything right and your grandma is happier with the conversations  than you realize.",2022-01-12 15:58:47,uncertainegg3,s2gr7s
Alzheimers,Dad keeps falling at the care facility. I don’t know what to do…Suggestions?,"My family has hired an additional person to watch him full time, one on one, at the care facility. Despite that, when he’s alone, he falls.","I don't think it can be entirely prevented.  Other than chaining him to his bed, he's gonna get up, and he's gonna fall.  Life can be rough.

Maybe someone else has more advice.
Vitamin D supplementation reduces falls

https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2020/08210/vitamin\_d\_supplement\_on\_prevention\_of\_fall\_and.14.aspx
so sorry.  If you have an extra person watching him 'full time' how is he ever alone?
A walking frame really helps my mum, and I installed hand rails. Also, what is causing him to fall? My mum had an infection but she didn't know how to tell anyone, once it was cleared up she was able to walk again. Last thing I can think of is going on walks with your dad to strengthen his legs. Hopefully some of these could help. Good luck
Grandma has fallen multiple times since moving into long term care. Some of her meds affect her balance and gait, so she’s in a wheelchair and cannot walk unassisted. But she wakes up in the middle of the night and doesn’t KNOW she has balance issues and needs help, gets up and falls. She also is constantly trying to get up out of her wheelchair to go do something… whatever the current fixation is… and falls. 

The nursing home has padded shorts she wears under her pants to cushion her hips, and we got her a padded toque to wear to protect her head. We know we can’t prevent every fall, but we can try to mitigate the damage.  She doesn’t notice the padded shorts at all, and she loves the toque because she’s always cold anyways.
Has the care facility provided any insight? Are these falls trying to get out of bed or chair? Do they know what leads up to the fall? Does he have a walker or wheelchair?
Due to these super busy short staffed days, I would adiscussion with the Dr to have a waist restraint put on your father. This is for when he gets up in the chair. Also his bed should have an alarm which goes off when he tries to get up. It can be set to ring as soon as his legs are over the edge. His walker should always be close to him. His urinal should be within reach at nighttime. Many falls happen when patient goes to the BR. It's  really tough for the staff to watch constantly.

Alzheimers,Troubling draft decision from Medicare,,"It is a poorly reasoned decision, from limiting the clinical evidence to compare aducanumab only with failed trials to the insistence that amyloid is “like, only a theory man.”  It was like they outsourced it to a pot smoking junior philosophy major.",2022-01-11 21:02:38,kippy236,s1u9sz
Alzheimers,Does the being forgotten part ever hurt less?,"My (31 F) mom, 64 with early onset Alzheimer's was officially diagnosed July 2021, and by August, had already started to forget me (we'd been wading through her symptoms until official diagnosis for a over a year at that point). I knew that we were going to get to the point where she'll start to forget me and others eventually, but I did not expect it so soon.

Every day, I'm either ""mom,"" ""what's your name,"" ""why don't you tell me your name,"" or ""you're nice, I like you."" Very rarely anymore am I her daughter or my name. 

I know 100% it is the disease and not her, but these past couple of weeks, it has really been hitting me hard, and it sucks. How did the woman who loved me so much forget me? How did the woman who had an endearing nickname for me since childhood, and who signed everything with ""I love you to infinity and beyond,"" and verbally told me she loved me any chance she got, forget me? How does she remember who my cousin and my cousin's children are, but not her own? It just makes me so sad I can't stand it.

I'm still really struggling to even accept our reality at this point. I understand it, but it is still so surreal. What happened to that woman I loved so much and could never fathom life without? Why did she leave me so soon? The woman that is taking up space in my house and my life is not someone I can really even stand to be around, and I don't like myself for it. I have no one. I am both of our parent at this point, and I cannot wait until the day this is no longer my burden. But the thought of carrying this grief with me for the rest of my life is heavy, and I feel like a piece of me already has died with her and who she used to be, and I will never get that back. I miss both of who we used to be terribly.

Also, for anyone who had a loved one who seemingly progressed (and I mean truly progressed this fast within a few months or a year; my mom doesn't really know how to eat without using her hands/being messy, is completely incontinent, speech is dwindling, no longer based in reality at all, does nothing with reason or logic, has lewy body characteristics and hallucinates people and conversations that aren't there/didn't happen) this fast and has already passed, how long did it take from diagnosis until the end? I know it varies, and I know there's no way of truly knowing, but I can't stop thinking about how much I'm already ready for her to go. This is no way for either of us to live. The fact that we don't have many options but to suffer without paying an exorbitant price is cruel.","I'm sorry.  Your experience and feelings are unfortunately far too common for those of us here.  I've recently realized that my Mom is no longer my Mom or my kids' ""Nana"" anymore -- she's a patient, a consideration to plans.  It's awful.  She hasn't forgotten her own kids' names yet, but her grandkids' names she has certainly forgotten along with pets and most extended family.  She long ago forgot the relationships between her sons' families (who's wife is who's, who's kids are who's,...).  And she lost connection to my Dad, her primary caretaker, like a year ago.  He's usually reduced to a fraudulent version of her husband -- a phony.  It's heartbreaking to see and hear what my Dad endures day in and day out.  But not unlike you, I've had to just recently reconcile with the fact that, for all intents and purposes, my Mom is gone.  I feel awful feeling this way and saying this because, after all, she is still ""here"".  My Mom was dx with EOAD in 2019 at 61 years old, and I still sometimes hope that this is just a bad dream that I'm having... that this isn't actually happening to our family.  It's awful.  Her father also had EOAD, although I think he was a little older when he was dx.  Now I have to worry about myself and my brothers... I've also come to realize recently that the odds are very much stacked against us.  At this rate it almost seems inevitable between my brothers and I , it's just a waiting game to see when and who it strikes.

Man, fuck this fucking awful fucking disease.  Fuck it right the fuck off.
My (34M) dad (64M) was diagnosed 4 years ago and there is not a day that goes by where I don't think about him and the awful sickness that has filled our family with grief. He lives with my mother who is his caretaker, but he has lost most communication skills. He's most often confused and doesn't really know who we are anymore. He can't make any new memories ever again. I'm struggling to deal with it all, but I see it from afar. I can't even imagine what it's like for you as her caretaker. I don't have the right words for you, just that you're not alone and the disease is inhumane and beyond cruel. No one deserves this, ever. 

The grief also comes in stages as they gradually lose all cognitive abilities.
Aw my friend I am sorry this is happening - you have support here with us. I really do understand how you feel. The first time my mom didn’t remember I was her daughter it felt like a punch to the gut. I was on break at work when I called and talked to her and I was basically useless for the rest of the day.


Have you looked into therapy? Is that an option? That was something I kept putting off until I absolutely snapped at work one day. I wish I had looked into it sooner. It was extremely beneficial. Even if the circumstances didn’t change it will still a relief to just talk about my feelings. 

My mom hasn’t passed yet - she is living in a nursing home at this point. I am waiting for the call from my brother telling me she’s died. I’ll be sad of course but it will also be a relief. I feel I have mourned her already. 

The sadness for me comes and goes in waves. Sometimes it isn’t there at all and then other times something random will happen and it’ll make me spiral. It’s been that way for about two years at this point.
My (71M) wife (69F) was diagnosed in August of 2020, but probably would have been diagnosed earlier in the year except for the pandemic.  On September 13th of that year, she and I went to brunch to celebrate our anniversary.  By September 25th, my birthday, she no longer recognized me as her husband.  For all of us whose spouse is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, there is first the shock that the “golden years” don’t look so golden anymore.  In my case, that was quickly followed by a feeling of having been “erased”, since the person I have spent most of my life with no longer knew I was the person with whom she shared that life.  She now thinks of me as the pretty nice guy who happens to live in the same house that she is staying in (That wasn’t always true - in October 2020, she texted our daughter that I was an a*hole.).

An Alzheimer’s/dementia support organization near us runs a support group for those experiencing “ambiguous loss”.  I think that is a good phrase to describe what many of us are experiencing.  The person sitting in the room with me looks like my wife, sounds like my wife, but has lost the essence of the woman who is my wife.  I mourn the loss of intimacy, the loss of shared memories, the loss of her companionship.
Im sorry love, that part is def hard. Big hug. My Mama passed three yrs ago and its still painful to think on the timeI realized she didnt know me.
I can't offer any practical advice, but please accept this virtual hug from a stranger.  My heart breaks for you, and all of us dealing with this bloody, cruel disease.
I have one story to share, as I've been where you are. I was my mom's sister (and boy did she hate me at that point), but more often I was a stranger. My dad and I shared a birthday and he had a stroke that took his life on my birthday, so birthdays have been rough since. Two days before my birthday a year ago, I got a call that my mom had attacked a nurse and paramedics and was in the ER with restraints in place to keep her from hurting herself or others. It broke my heart as this was not my mom.

I raced to the ER and she was sleeping, so I held her hand and sat with her. When she woke up a couple of hours later, she looked right at me, smiled, called me by my name, and said she was so happy to see I'd finally returned from my business trip. (It's apparently what she made up to explain our absence during the pandemic.) By the end of the stay in the ER, she was laughing and completely compliant with anything she was told. That was the last time she used my name, and it's a memory that surpasses any of the others where she had no idea who I was.
Is pretty sad actually, my mother in law would know my name, but would call her daughter Miss Eli or my wife. Would not acknowledge she had daughters, would call her mother some days.

So don't hit yourself is no one's fault. Try figuring out in what time period she believes she is in so things have more context and you can navigate around it.
My (30 F) mom (70 F) has Alz and it’s very tough seeing the decline happen right in front of you and knowing there’s no way to stop it. Having older parents, I knew I’d be dealing with caring for them eventually, but after my dad passed earlier this year, she went downhill again and it’s becoming more of an issues now. This disease SUCKS and it’s unfair especially when the caregivers/family members are the ones getting hurt in the process. Keep strong!
It hurts to the very end, or at least it did for me. Two things helped me. One I focused on the fact that she knew I was connected to her and just enjoyed that. I also focused on where she seemed to be in her memories. How could she remember her child if she didn’t remember being married. Towards the end I was a sister or her mother. She forgot her youngest two sisters as well, even in old pictures. It does get easier though. I would tell her my name. She would get excited and tell me it was the same as her mother’s. Very hard, but at least I would get to hear her say my name a few more times. 

I hate this for you and me and ever that has had to deal with any form of dementia. Cruel diseases for sure.
Yup, its been a 16 year journey with us mom is now 87. She moves through each stage very slowly but it's about 5 years at stage 7 now. She forgot me, her only  child (47m) about 3 years ago. My dad who is 90 now and I have to clean and feed her each day (squeeze style baby food and Ensure in sippy cups) as she is confined to a bed for over 14 months now and cannot even move her limbs any longer. She just mumbles in her childhood foreign language now. Her limbs are swollen at times and her arms get raw, dry, and sore as well. Everything about whats happening to her is awful and my entire life is on hold, no job, no social life, basically doing nothing each day but sit at home with her and my own wife and kids for 3 1/2 years now since it wasn't cost effective to put her in nursing care since I manage all her assets. It totally sucks, but it is what it is. It looks like she is very near the end now but we said the same thing during the summer of 2021. The doctor even had her on hospice and then had to take her off for living through all this. Every case is different. The ones that go is less than 5-7 years from start to finish is a blessing in disguise, trust me, this experience is awful for everyone involved in this.
I feel you. My mom was diagnosed about a year ago, but my dad knew what was going on for about a year prior...took getting power of attorney to get her tested. Her doc was saying it wasn't necessary and she probably didn't want to know the truth. 

She's falling pretty hard. My sister visits once a month (from out of state) and my dad gets asked ""who was that nice woman with the white dog?"". My brother (further out of state) is ""a kid who used to hang around our house"". She only knows one of his kids names, which is surprising considering she doesn't remember him half the time. They actually had to turn him home halfway through a 10hr car ride to see her recently bc she didn't know who he was and got frustrated/angry when they explained it. I can't imagine how my dad feels. Or how she does with the confusion leading to frustration and anger. The only time my sister has ever heard my dad cry was after he told her about my mom not remembering who my sister is or that she's her daughter. Losing his best friend of 50 years...

I honestly have no idea if my mom knows who I am. Nobody has told me, maybe for my own peace of mind...I'm not sure. I haven't seen her since a year before covid...I live 1,800mi away and haven't taken the risk of becoming a breakthrough case while flying and giving it to my parents... But I know before talking to her my dad would say something like, ""your son, SaltLake, is on the phone and wants to talk"". When he doesn't introduce me, her trying to think of me could just be the quirky camping guy in the desert who talks about bees and flowers a lot and has a golden retriever.

My sister actually moved up her wedding to late winter in the hopes my mom would remember it. I'm going bc it's her wedding obviously, but it also might be the last time I see my mom when she's mostly there. For all I know, I could just be ""the guy who has come by for Christmas the past 15 years"" or the ""desert camping bee flower golden retriever guy""

From my experience of my grandma having Alzheimer's, it doesn't really get better. My only real solice is that my parents both agreed, years before she lost her faculties, to not let it get as bad as my grandma  - that if either are not eating, they won't feed them and put them in hospice. As fucked up as it is, it's compassionate care at that point.

My grandma was about 5 years. She stuck on, but only because my grandpa fed her. She was not there at all for the last several years.

It's such a shitty god awful disease. I don't know how much time left she has.
No, it rips your heart out every time you see them.
For now, she *might* still remember *you* as a concept even if she does not look at your face and recognize it. You can ask her questions about her daughter (who she may remember as a younger person), what is her favorite part about “her” and maybe she can give you a few memories. Maybe the last bit of relationship memories you can squeeze out of her. But yeah no it’s horrible like squeezing blood from a stone
I’m so sorry. I’ve been reading a book on Alzheimer’s that suggests you could show your mom a picture of you as a child and ask if she remembers that child. If she does, she can tell you how much she loves you in a new way through your memories together.
In time, it will hurt less but not while your mom is still here.  I had a hard time with loosing my mom before she actually died as well.  I chose to embrace who she saw me as, Mom, friend, co-worker,  I just went with it and we were two people sharing our thoughts and time.  This did make things a bit easier but I will not lie, I still cried at times for her to know me.  She called me by my name the day she died.
In my experience, no it will always hurt.  I'm so sorry about what is happening to your mom.",2022-01-11 19:16:31,shady-pines-ma,s1rz8h
Alzheimers,Adult daycare questions,"My dad (70) hasa diagnosis of cognitive brain impairment and symptoms that appear like Alzheimer's. My mom (68) has been caring for him and is accepting some of his mental changes, but she needs help. She can't do it all. 

He doesn't need to be ""babysat"" all the time, but he is getting to where he should be. He isn't wandering but he sometimes makes weird decisions and shouldn't drive. 

I'm happy to help my parents and I love hanging out with my dad. But my mom needs more help. How do we find an adult daycare for my dad that he might like? He is still fairly self aware and I believe would be defensive to being left to be babysat. He would understand what that means, when he would rather be doing other things. Thank you.","Contact a local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, or the like.  They'll have resources for different options available in your area.

My parents were in a similar boat with my Mom, who was dx with EOAD at 61.  My Dad needed help and my Mom was still far too self-aware to go along with being babysat.  So my Dad worked with the administration of the program to devise some ""*Shutter Island*"" kind of shit with my Mom, a lifelong nurse.  Her dx came after she was put on medical leave for making errors at work, so my Dad and the administration of the center devised a plan for to be a volunteer caretaker of sorts at the day program she attends.  A year or two later, she's obviously much further along with the disease, but still refers to it as going ""to work"".  And the ""paychecks"" she's getting are really just the SSI/Disability that she's been collecting since she lost her job.  There's been a couple of small hiccups with my Mom taking staff-like liberties because she believes she works there like everyone else, but they've been negligible and easily remedied.

My Dad was also able to leverage some other local NFPs to get some financial assistance to cover the weekly costs of her enrollment in the program.

I offer this as a real creative solution to the problem.  However it may not fit for your Dad's interests and abilities, and it's possible he's still too aware to going along with this at all.  It may take a little more time sharing duties between you and your Mom before Dad can be convinced to participate in something like this in any kind of way.
Googling is probably going to be the most beneficial for finding a place in your area. Adult Day Care or Adult Day Services with your city in the search will probably yield some returns. You could contact A Place for Mom and have them do some leg work for you also - but be prepared for them to be kind of pushy about other services as well. 

If he's still in the very early stages, maybe you or other family members can take him to the local senior center to give your mom a break. If you do end up finding a care center, just remind him it's for retirees to hang out and enjoy some activities and doesn't necessarily mean you think he needs a babysitter.
Contact the Aging and Disability Center for your area and ask for some referrals for adult day cares.  These programs are often very good for clients, they provide social contact, gentle exercise, art and music, healthy meals, some minor nursing care such as taking vitals and dispensing meds.  You should pre-screen by interviewing on the phone and then go for a visit, with or without him.

The good news is, a lot of the clients actually like being there.  I'm sure some centers are better than others, the only way to know is to go visit (with appointment, of course).
call your local DSS and get them involved. There are probably resources/block grants available. My local DSS gave me a choice of having a nurse twice a week to stop by or adult daycare. My local Alz support group was very helpful in the Adult daycare screening process....

We just went through this with my mom. We googled (and my dad asked friends and family locally) to find a good place. 

The place he found was fantastic for a lot of reasons. They offered an online caregiver course that was perfect for my dad. Since it was virtual, he could join without leaving my mom at home alone, and he learned a ton. 

We also had to be creative about getting her there and they were great about rolling with it. We told her they were looking for volunteers, and my mom really wanted to volunteer somewhere (she wants to ""rebuild her resume"" so that she can get back in the workforce - another story).  The tour leader did a great job of outlining what she would help with ""as a volunteer"", and discreetly handed the paperwork to my dad at the end. 

Of course, this backfired on us during the holidays, when she was ""way too busy"" to volunteer... but overall, it worked out really well.
I can’t speak to every municipality, but I know mine has two programs, one is the Adult Day program with CNAs on staff and a lower ratio; takes Medicaid payment. 

And then Parks & Rec also runs something called “senior social club” which is for people without “medical” needs (can stand/walk and use bathroom on their own), with meals provided but less intensive staff coverage. It sounds like your dad could be a candidate for the latter, if such a program exists in your municipality.",2022-01-11 10:11:07,jamoe,s1f3ze

Alzheimers,Frustration with Hospitals,"On the 2nd, my grandma (74f) fell out of bed and was showing stroke symptoms. She's had Todd's paresis in the past but I still figured I'm better off to call 911. Unfortunately, due to covid restrictions my mom and I were kicked out. I'll call this hospital E, this has been our main hospital.

Hospital E has been pretty good with updates. However, they are very much a ""money first"" hospital.  She ended up having her test for a stroke come back negative along with her CT. An MRI was never done because even with her on meds she wouldn't stay still long enough.

We decided to just make her comfortable and being hospice. This is when problems start happening. Hospital E wants her out ASAP claiming they don't have a hospice program. We're given a social worker and told our only option was a nursing home nearby costing $9000 a month. We knew there other options because we live in a very senior heavy town. I've known that Hospital E receives money for referrals there.

Eventually, we find a good long term care and hospice facility I'll call BG. My grandma gets transferred after 5 days at Hospital E to BG. She really likes it at BG, they play music and have snack time (her words). She's there about 2 days when I get the call there is two COVID cases at BG. No big deal, they isolate her and the other patients. Day 3 she begins to act up and refuses to leave another patients room. BG wants to send her to get a psych eval so she can be on the right medication. I agree with it and she's sent to Hospital G, a hospital with a good psych ward as known from personal experience.

Hospital G receives her and immediately tests her for COVID as a precaution. She's positive. This means she either caught it at Hospital E or before hand. Not at BG, as she wasn't there long enough for her to test positive for it.

This makes my mom and I go through all of her charts to see if she was tested and when. Hospital E marks her oxygen was low and her lungs trashed. Only 1 rapid test was ever done, an Abbott test that has been more likely for false negatives. My mom and I test for covid, I'm negative my mom is positive. She has had covid since she ended up in Hospital E, now 8 days ago.

Hospital G has no more COVID beds and needs to transfer again. BG's sister location, BW, has a covid isolation area as it's much bigger. She's sent to it and  finally I can relax. She's in a good place, I trust them.

Tonight I get a call at 3:50am. My grandma is hitting and scratching everyone she can at BW. They need to transfer her as they are not capable for psych patients. She's being transferred to Hospital S. Immediately, I'm worried. My grandpa had gone to Hospital S after a stroke where he was mistreated horribly. That was 23 years ago, hopefully things have improved.

After looking into her charts from Hospital E, I'm glad she's not there. Since June, my grandma has been to Hospital E five times. Only once did they do a urine test. One of the most common tests for seniors. As well, she was brought in on the 17th for extreme aggression. Not a single test was done. In June and two other visits (can't remember exactly when) I brought her in for rectal bleeding. Once again, no tests were done as her very quick exams showed she wasn't bleeding anymore. In August, I finally got them to do a more thorough exam and she's diagnosed with cancer. Hospital E looks like such a nice caring hospital but they are some of the most incompetent doctors I've ever met.

I'm so frustrated because most of this could have been avoid if Hospital E actually ran the tests she needed. This isn't the first time I've had issues with them but I sure hope this the last.

TL;DR grandma went to the hospital and nobody ran any tests and she keeps getting transferred","Extremely irresponsible of them not to test for UTI immediately upon observing behavioral changes. I hope you find the care she needs <3
That sounds miserable.  I hope things straighten out pretty soon.  Good luck.",2022-01-11 06:20:03,melody436,s1aov3
Alzheimers,Looking for advice on how to help my dad (66) the best I can who is suffering from Alzheimers,"My dad is 66 and was diagnosed with FTD two years ago and a different doctor decided Alzheimers a couple years ago instead of FTD. Either way my father had been getting worse and worse recently. My mom is his primary care taker and I help out along with one of my in laws. Currently my dad is having more and more bowel issues. He is currently wearing a depends 100% of the time because is loosing control more and more, he will often make it to the toilet but not always. 

One of my hardest struggles with helping him with his battle is also helping my mother keep her sanity and also getting my mom to keep my father at home for as long as he can be. There was a 6 month stint a little more than year ago where my dad went to the hospital and then to a nursing home to help them figure out meds correctly. This was extremely hard to deal with because it was covid time and nobody was allowed to see him. My mom was also more than happy to take a break from my dad at this time mainly due to the disease and my dads hallucinations at the time. I felt really bad because he was completely pulled from the world he knew and put into a place he completely hates. He also hates a nursing home and the time that he was in there he was so young compared to everyone else in there :( I also feel bad for my mom because this is a lot to handle and deal with. After the 3 months of being in the hospital and then 3 months in a nursing home he came back home and has been there since. Him and my mom have traveled often and I will go with them at times to help with my dad as well. So he has been doing ""decent"" but is getting worse and worse.

Fast forward to today he is having issues making it to the bathroom all the time and isn't always getting cleaned up after going and not always getting cleaned up in the shower either. Mom said today that he was very sore down there so I feel like he's probably not ever getting fully cleaned up. Mom was talking to me about getting him into a nursing home again and was going to call up a local place that we had previously talked about to see what it entails to get him in there. I will always push for him to stay at his home because this is where he is comfortable and wants to be but I think my mom is getting to a point that it is beyond her level of care ability. 

My question is, what are the options that we can look at for in home care/assistance vs placing my dad into a nursing home again? Thanks for any help :)","If your mom wants to put him into nursing care, maybe you should try to respect her wishes. She may be at the breaking point. It sounds like she is the full/primary caregiver and that takes its toll. If she says it’s time for a nursing home, I wouldn’t push her to keep dad at the house.

// Edit // 

My mom is newly diagnosed but well mid stage. Yesterday some family members were discussing long term plans and my uncle was saying that he just couldn’t picture my mom in a home. Well…. do you want to take care of her then? If the answer is no, you have to respect the caregivers’ wishes.
You can have aides come in to help him bathe and dress daily.  If he is having pain related to the bowel issues, they might be able to apply topical treatments.

Hope you get some other, better suggestions.
You are so good for being attentive to your dad and your mom and trying to help. 

For the toilet stuff you could try looking for a bedside, portable, or folding commode: https://www.amazon.com/folding-steel-commode/s?k=folding+steel+commode

My grandma used to need one and it helped. Cleaning it out was gross but at least it was a landing spot she could reach in time. 

You could also use baby wet wipes from costco for making sure hes clean when hes done. https://costcofan.com/costco-kirkland-signature-baby-wipes/ theres some thats flushable and some that arent so id watch out for that. 

You can also get no rinse bath things.. Soaps and wipes. I haven't used this brand but this is the idea: https://www.amazon.com/stores/No-Rinse+by+Cleanlife+Products/page/2F2F49B8-69B6-4920-9537-69A317FB5ABA?ref_=ast_bln

Like i think some others mentioned you can see if theres ways to get more help from community. Theres sometimes nonprofit or volunteer orgs like Alzheimer's assoc or  church groups who have volunteers (even for non church members) who can help keep an eye out for dad, or maybe feed him if he needs it. Or they can do other house chores like cleaning or washing or laundry while you or mom attends to dad. Or sit with him while you guys run errands. 

If you live in the US you may have an office of elderly or senior affairs, at the state but also at the county level. Sometimes you can get grants that could pay for some day care, or have a nurse or skilled person come in and help with things like wash dad. My grandma had this, from county offices. 1 day a week she had free daycare, and 1 day she had a nurse come in and give her a bath, with no rinse baths we did on the other days. The type of help available will vary greatly by county, and some may have long waitlists but some wont. These same offices may also be able to provide guidance or lists of facilities or care providers in your area. Your local Alzheimer's Association may also have such guides on hand. 

In the end tho.. Go easy on your mom if you can. It looks like you're trying your best to support her too, and that is extremely, extremely great!!  But if she is the primary caretaker I would sort of lean towards letting her decide when to call it quits. For my fam, I used to look at it like: ""this ship is sinking no matter what i do. All I can do is make sure my mom don't go down with it."" 

In the mean time tho.. Do like you're doing now, and keep scrounging for that help and advice. Unfortunately, thats just how it is.. You piece together your own network of help, just like youre doing now (and it seems you're doing great). 

Good luck.
In addition to the other hygiene suggestions, get a simple bidet attachment for the toilet. They're inexpensive and you can get one from Amazon or even Costco sometimes. This will save caregivers and your Dad from some wiping and will be gentler on his skin as well. Sprays that dissolve feces to help with big cleanups are also helpful, for instance ""Secura Personal Cleanser"" from Amazon. Someone needs to take a good look and determine what is sore and why. If it's irritated skin from being wet or dirty, you might try a barrier cream to protect the skin from moisture such as ""Aloe Vesta Protective Ointment"" from Amazon (only apply to clean & dry skin).  If it's something more serious that requires a doctor's visit and some nursing follow up, try to get the doctor to write a prescription for home healthcare (this is different than the aides you hire yourself and is paid for by Medicare). Accompanying your Dad for scheduled trips to the bathroom, such as after every meal and every couple of hours to see if you can get him on a bowel movement schedule (on the toilet instead of in the diaper) would be helpful as well. The bottom line with all of these suggestions is that it's a lot of work for a caregiver. Even with a professional caregiver coming into the home regularly (which can get expensive), your Mom is still left with a lot of hours that she is the one to deal with cleanups and whatever else happens.
[https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/resources/locator\_tool](https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/resources/locator_tool)

Have you considered [Adult Daycare](https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/adult-day-care)? It's like a school day. So your dad can get some social interaction and give your mom rest for several hours. Average cost is $50-100 per day often on a sliding scale by income, if the patient isn't already on Medicaid.

Here is information on [Medicaid-covered home care.](https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/medicaid-waivers/home-care)

Here is information on [financial planning to qualify for Medicaid long-term care, income and asset requirements etc.](https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/)
Definitely look into whether there are senior services or Alzheimer's services in your community that provide some home care (companionship, bathing, dressing). This might give your mom a bit of relief. PSWs could also be scheduled for a couple of hours each day at a time when your mom needs the most help (eg evening). Paid help will be costly but weigh this against cost of nursing home. Good luck. I feel your pain. It's tough for both of your parents.
You need to also think about your mother. She can't handle him alone, either you hire someone to help out 2/3 of the day or sadly the nursing home is your best option before it gets to difficult for her to manage and then you have to rush into a nursing home you may not like, but is the one available.
Join a support group. Seek out help from the Alzheimer’s association. Social workers are godsends. Reach out to your county’s aging office. Get his will poa and healthcare directive in order

Alzheimers,I need some advice,"My dad is 59 years old and he's been really forgetful lately. Its not as serious, he isn't confused, disorianted nor does he have any symptoms i found online, but he forgets stuff like something we talked about recently or things i told him. Sometimes hes on his phone while i tell him my work shifts or simmilar and at first i thought he wasnt really listening and that might be the reason, but at the same time he did carry the conversation normally at the time. Yesterday he went to turn off the heating in the house and i dont know what he did but aparently he forgot in the meantime to do it, he wasnt absent for unusual time either. He used to have troubles remembering what grade i am in school or some stuff about my life but i guess that he just didnt care about it, dont get me wrong hes a great guy and i never held it against him. Im just trying to say he always had great memory just not about stuff he didnt find interesting i guess.

When i point it out he just jokes that he got old, but hes not that old. Hes super stubborn and he wont go to the doctor about anything yet alone for this to get checked out. My grandma got senile around age 82 and i had memory issues from an early age, simmilar to my dad i just couldnt remember things i didnt care about no matter how recently they happened, like homework and much more. I dont know if that matters.","Any reason to suspect ADHD?  That can be another reason to not remember something you aren't interested in.
My father's family has a strong history of early onset and he has been increasingly worried about it as his older siblings have all died with Alzheimer's. He's had himself genotyped and has a few predisposing factors.

My mother and I have always known him to be forgetful. He has a long history of forgetting where he hid birthday/Christmas gifts or that they even existed. I had to pay significant library fines because he took loaned books away and we didn't find them until we moved out of that house (years later). All bills get sent to my mother so they will get paid on time.

His doctor suggested a memory evaluation with his 65 check up. They found that his memory was in the 90% level for 65 year olds. Your comment about remembering what you care about rings very true for me.

From speaking to him, he believes he has MCI (Moderate Cognitive Impairment), instead of stage 5 Alzheimer's, which he was diagnosed with in 2019. I understand lack of insight into their own condition is a common feature of those who suffer from Alzheimer's. 

Unlike last holiday, P did not get his once beloved grandchild anything despite sending my aunt a card with all of our names signed (except his grandchild) and proudly centering the name of “his Girlfriend N.”

He also had his caregiver drive him to the jewelry store and purchase an engagement ring. P proposed to N on December 22. 

Around the same time, my aunt D (70 F) and brother J (51 M) worked with a family law attorney to arrange for his doctor to give P a capacity test. J got P to the doctor’s office but P would not go along with this test until he saw it was being given by a beautiful blond woman. Now he was really into taking the test and impressing this woman. He also volunteered to her that he didn't have a girlfriend. Needless to say, he failed the test. J then went back to lawyer with test results and got his name back on the trust, which P had removed back in October when N told him to cut us off. 

P also had a visit from Adult Protective Services, who reported that he seemed confused during questioning about his relationship with N and told the social services worker he was not planning to marry N or anyone. As far as we know, P did not report either the test or SS visit to N as he seems a little scared of her reaction. (we found that if the person is competent, SS will not take the report. P was found not competent).

After a break for the New Year, we have learned that P & N are now working with an attorney to create a new will and trust for P, who did his will in 2019 after the death of his 2nd wife (named N also) in 2013. Once P tries to move the money to N, he will learn what J has done and P & N will not be happy.  

We do not know how she will react, but the lawyers are standing by with an injunction in case she moves on P’s trust, which she will as she is utterly relentless. We also plan to air this person out to P's whole community, including friends who could have a positive influence. We hope.","I haven’t been following this, but if you have the funds maybe it might be worth hiring a PI to find out more about N.

Also, on a unhelpful side note, P fighting the cognitive test until he saw a beautiful blond is the silver lining for when you gotta tell this story later on in life, looking back and laughing.
Well done, good on you!  Sorry for yr dad, for the whole thing, but it's not cool to be taken advantage of, & scammed.  I hope the airing out can go smoothly with least embarrassment for yr dad, how devastating.  best of luck!",2022-01-10 02:27:51,COMMODOREXXX,s0e8zj
Alzheimers,How to Get Through the Always Being Right and Accusing You of Theft Part of Alzheimer’s?,"I’m am just having a lot of trouble dealing mentally with my father’s Alzheimer’s right now and could really use some advice/support. As the title mentions he’s always been stubborn but ALZ has made it ten times worse to the point of creating animosity amongst his loved ones. He makes up entire stories in his head where he told someone this or this is how an event happened and it’s not at all. The arguing takes a toll. It could even be as simple as us watching a show and him claiming he saw it and knows how it ends (like a cooking competition) but that’s clearly impossible because all episodes haven’t aired. He’ll insist of rewatching every episode available and gets mad when there are no more proving he was incorrect but never admits it. While this is annoying it’s something one can learn to live with. But the stealing assertions are just wild. He’ll misplace his debit card, forget his password or don’t know how to use cash app and turn around and accuse mainly me (his daughter) of stealing his money. He’ll call and I can be out in public listening to him rant about how he’ll send me to jail and he doesn’t care who I am. I’ll get long drawn out text messages saying the same thing. Then when he finds it there’s no apology or anything. My thing is and maybe this is where I falter in understanding is I can’t process the behavior because in my mind he should know right from wrong. Admittedly, from my perspective I really only think of Alzheimer’s as a memory disease. What am I missing here? I remember my mom telling me about how my grandma treated her. She said that others told her that patients usually treat the person who does the most/closest to them the worse","[Give this a read. ](https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/suspicions-delusions) Especially the How to Respond part at the end. You are going to have to change how you approach this (and kudos for posting here about it). Arguing is a bad move and reasoning may work sometimes, but will be unreliable. My mom does the same thing with TV. No matter what we watch, new or old, it's ""I've seen this before, I just don't remember how it ended."" Correcting them accomplishes nothing. I know it's hard to hear them make up and believe stories, but sometimes you gotta go with it. My mom sometimes calls me her brother and asks where her dead dad is. It's heartbreaking, but I have to play along sometimes. I would also highly recommend you talk with your family about the debit card thing as it may be time to completely remove access to finances. It's a very tough decision and not easy to do, but if he is struggling to keep track of things now it may be time. I'm sure you can get lots of tips and advice about that here, should you decide it's time.
Just know that it is a phase of the disease that is extremely common and will eventually pass as the disease progresses.  For my mom, it seemed like it took 9-12 months for the accusations of stealing to run their course.  Trying to argue about what happened is futile and counter-productive.  Your dad's mind is in a different reality.

Alzheimers attacks the brain, including memory, but the disease also affects other parts of the brain that manage other things, like vision, taste and behavior, including social filters and logic.  Always remember not to take anything he says personally, and that it's the disease that is in control.
Personality changes are a part of it. I know one person who had a really good relationship with her mom and then with Alzheimer's it was like mom was *disgusted* with her and talked to her with such hate, and it was confusing and out of nowhere. My grandma also had moments when she talked to me with such intense focused venom too. Tbf i didnt know all the words (she didnt speak english) but i sure as heck knew that tone and the curse words. At some point my dad was was off and on *inappropriate* with me and he was never, not even close to being like that before Alzheimer's. Its not them, its the disease. I know its hard to not take it personally but try to imagine some tiny evil third party sitting in their skulls and messing with the wiring bc thats effectively what it is. 

And those other comments about POA and MPOA are spot on. Get advice from the .orgs in near you, from county and state offices on aging if available, and yes the docs assistance will be needed. Its also possible a law school near you might offer assistance for stuff like this as part of their requirements for some students to graduate, esp if they have an elderlaw program. If it doesn't work right away, you need to keep a close eye on it for the next best time to try again bc it literally could cost you both, at the stage he is in. Good luck.
Read the 36 hour day. Or at least flip through it by the relevant section.

I'm getting these episodes happen more often in the late afternoon, evening, night time? It is called **sundowning**. Having a word for it helps so that you can search for strategies to handle it. Also; prompting bedtime earlier like 8pm instead of 10 or 11 just to avoid the opportunity.

More or less, you entertain his thought for a moment, then try to give him avenues to save face such as blaming third parties. ""Maybe you're thinking of last week"" or ""if you already know the ending; let's watch something else then"" and it gives you an avenue to change the topic. 

Re: the TV shows, if you have Netflix etc I would start putting on for ""his"" shows that he can watch multiple times like comfort food. 

Instead of ""I didn't steal it"" go search for it with him saying out loud the places you're checking. ""Maybe it got left in the car, or at the restaurant"" If he says that's not my debit card, call the phone number (with him) and say you want the card locked until you find it. 

Also tell everyone in the family to take his accusations with a very fine grain of salt because this accusations on the people closest to him is all textbook for the disease.

I remember 3 M's. Music, mug, melatonin. Calming music, herbal tea in a mug, and melatonin (especially pre-emptively) to make him calm and sleepy.  **don't give him benadryl** to fall asleep!!!
Hi there. When my mom was first diagnosed with Alzheimer’s she still had her cell phone. She would call the Alzheimer’s 800 number and tell them I was holding her captive or stealing her money.
One example is when we brought my grandmother back from her PT rehab a couple weeks ago she kept saying this isn’t my house. the typical knee-jerk reaction is to say yes it is your house. this last time I tried some thing a little different. I said “I know it doesn’t feel like home but what can we do to make it feel close enough?” to which she said “nothing. it’s a perfect replica”. then I said “if it feels creepy having a wax version of your house then maybe let’s try not to make it the same, we can repaint and decorate it so that it doesn’t feel like a fake.” which to my surprise she actually latched onto. then I took out some Benjamin Moore paint color catalogs and started flipping through “for inspiration”. it doesn’t really matter if the walls ever get repainted or not. Reading the blurbs and paint color names to her, takes her mind off the old one. then I started making commentary about the paint colors like other things it looks like or what it reminds me of, basically throwing out bait for another topic. and then eventually she calmed and got distracted by something else. 

it’s a cold comfort but eventually the accusations become more and more wacky that they do look unreasonable to outsiders. again keep a journal of these delusions and subsequent tantrums. see if you can identify a pattern as to what triggered each one 

for example Capras delusion, where they believe their family or house etc has been replaced by fake duplicates in order to scam her. and then will walk right into any scam from a total stranger 🙄

give up the idea that they will be convinced by you and your sound logic and reason. basically they don’t feel comfortable in their own skin and can’t rely on their memory in other ways which is really scary so it is easier to blame it on an outside party like a whole conspiracy against you, than your own brain. but I know it’s really exhausting being the bad cop all the time.  

give yourself a break and start just saying OK and then changing the topic. if they say some thing like “close the door” and the door is already closed do not say “it is already closed”
just go open it and then close it loudly. 

another recent one was “someone is parked in my space.” don’t say “no that’s my car”. tell them you’ll go talk to the visitors in the wrong spot and then just leave the room and come back and tell them you worked it out.
Something to keep in mind- put yourself in their shoes. Imagine your brain is starting to fail you, parts of it just don’t seem to work right- now you have family members who are contradicting things that you KNOW for sure to be facts. Whether it’s cooking shows or stuff being stolen, EVERYONE seems to be against you- sure, you might realize that your brain isn’t working the way it used to, but wouldn’t that make you even more upset when these things you KNOW are facts are being questioned?

It’s not really possible for someone with a damaged mind to reason their way through these things- Since you’re the one with a fully functioning brain and a complete understanding of what’s going on, the responsibility to adapt to the situation falls on you. You’re capable of adapting, they are not. 

Easier said than done, yeah- but once you accept the fact that it is what it is- it’s not personal, no matter how personal it feels, and only one of you has the tools to try to “fix” the situation- your options become clearer at least. There is no point in arguing, there are no winners in these arguments anyway- find a way to support your father through them in a way that doesn’t stress you out.
My sweetheart couldn't even talk during the last few years.
My guy also repeatedly insisted he had seen a show or movie before, when in fact we were watching it on its very first air date.  After he lost his wallet three times in a row, I took away all his credit cards and the password to our Amazon account.  Soon he could not even log into his computer due to forgetting the password.  Even when it was written on a Post-It attached to the computer, he could not log in - yet I could, using the same password.  Frequently he takes things apart or unplugs every cord because ""it doesn't work"" when in fact he just can't remember how to operate it.

Edit:  not done, this posted before I intended.

How I conceptualize this is, the ego of the patient is so fragile and vulnerable, and they have a need to repeatedly assert that they are right, competent, etc.  It may not work for you, but I have used actual behaviors to justify things.  For instance, losing 3 wallets and having to call every credit card company - the first 2 times, he called them himself.  By the 3rd time, he could not, so I called and closed every account.  How I got him to stop driving:  ""Two doctors have said you should stop driving now.""  But he kept his driver's license, until he lost that too - and I said No way am I getting you another, if I have to stand in a long line at the DMV I will get you a state ID instead (not a drivers license).  I now keep  all his IDs, insurance card, etc in my own wallet, and if he's unhappy with that, I remind him of losing 3 wallets before.  In other words, I didn't spare his feelings but pointed out how his own behaviors and errors made this necessary.

I hope this helps, and I know it won't work for everyone.
It seems like ALZ brings out the predominant traits of their personality.  I never got along with my mom very well from the time I was a teen - we were never really close.  I believe she has narcissistic personality disorder, and I was always the scapegoat while my brother was the golden child.  Those roles have reversed.  She lived with my brother for a while and accused him of physically abusing her, stealing from our uncle who was in a nursing home, and vandalizing her car - I'm not just saying this because he's my brother, but he would absolutely never do any of that.  When she went into memory care, she would constantly call and verbally abuse me.  Unfortunately, you sometimes just have to take it, because they don't know what they are doing.  I'm not proud to say that I did yell back at her a couple of times.  She tested positive for COVID back in September (luckily she was triple vaxxed and had no symptoms, but was quarantined at the facility), and it seems like something about that has mellowed her out.  She no longer calls and yells at me - we've visited her and she was happy to see us.  The folks at the facility said sometimes they get over it, and sometimes they don't.  Dementia is a horrible, horrible disease.  It's doesn't just steal their memory, it steals their dignity.  My normally neat mother became a hoarder of garbage who would constantly lie about her hygiene.  She would never bathe and often we would walk into a clogged toilet in her apartment when she was living alone.
On paperwork for Power of Attorney for finances and medical - he has to sign them while he mentally still can!  Once dementia reaches the point where he no longer understands what he is signing, it’s too late.  Then you have to go to court for guardianship, which is expensive and time consuming.  Think of a good story to tell him that allows him the grace to sign the papers without the embarrassment of having Alzheimer’s.
OMG. My grandma died in the last 3 weeks but I still remember her doing much of this. She had vascular dementia. She was so weak yet so bossy! We were able to deal with her behavior by trying not to argue and saying we were listening, and then we tried to get her to talk about something else.

And your mom is right. Our loved ones treat us the worst. I think it's cause they're really unhappy and scared and they know they can tell us anything.",2022-01-09 17:03:11,Chellybeanz29,s02vj1
Alzheimers,Toilet issues,"Hi I am relatively new to this community and this is my first encounter (I was very young with other encounters) with altzheimers. My grandmother is living in a 80% care facility, the other 20% is up to the family. This works quite well for now except that she struggles with going to the toilet. She does not recognize the toilet as usable, this leads to some accidents. Previously in her old home and when she visited mine this was not an issue. Does anyone have any advise to help her. Already tried a paper sign with toilet written on to it. These accidents create insecurity that stick by her like a bad feeling, so I hope I can help her out.","Does she just not realize/recognize that she has to go? Forgets where the toilet is?

Alzheimers,Ways to help someone with early to middle stage Alzheimer's?,"Hi everyone,

First off, sorry for the super long post!

My grandma (78) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in the past month. She is in early-middle stages according to the doctor. In general she is really forgetful and will ask the same things over and over again, forgets that conversations already happened, forgets how to fix a problem with her phone after I've told her many times how to, tries to tell my mom directions while driving even though she already knows the way and has said so, etc. 

She had needed a bit more help because she had some major surgery and became less independent because of it, but then when covid happened you could really notice a difference where she became super forgetful and kind of confused. Like for example she saw a reflection of lights in the window and thought there was a car driving towards the house. 

She also gets worried when things don't go according to her ""routine"" like if someone leaves the lights on, if my uncle doesn't close the door behind him in his room, etc. She fixates on that kind of stuff especially the lights and the door to the point where she will tell everyone in the house multiple times a day to watch out for the lights & door.

Finally a big problem she has is getting dressed and showering. I'm not sure how much of that is Alzheimer's, because she has pretty bad mobility in general and arthritis so I think it is more difficult for her to put on clothes but she refuses on principle instead of saying she can't move or whatever. She says ""I'm old and I'm not going anywhere"" or ""I don't want to take a shower it's too hard"". My mom has asked her questions to get her to elaborate like, is it hard to step in the shower? Is it too hot or cold? Do you need a shower chair to sit in? Is it too difficult or painful to reach your body? Etc and my grandma just says it's too hard. We currently have her showering once a week ideally but it can go up to a month before she will do anything, and usually does not change her clothes more than once or twice a week in addition. She is super stubborn about it. I've read that is a common thing in Alzheimer's but I'm not really sure why or what we should do about it.

What I wanted to know was is there anything we can do to help her/make her less confused? We have a schedule of the days events written on a big board next to her bed with all the things she has to do. She also frequently texts us what are our plans and we go over what everyone will be doing that day. We already take care of all her food, laundry, and cleaning. I thought maybe it would help if she had a hobby to help keep track of time or make days different from each other but she is very ambivalent towards everything and says she has no preferences. Currently she mostly watches TV, but she sometimes does crossword puzzles. Although she said she's having more difficulty with them recently. I figured something like crossword puzzles would be good for your brain so we encourage her to do them. 

Is there anything else I should know that would be helpful???  Any advice, suggestions, experiences welcome! My mom doesn't really like to talk about it so I want to see if there's something I can do myself or we can do as a family without putting too much burden on my mom.","Yeh, it's tough.  Good on you for wanting to help!    I suppose you ought to contact your area dementia .org / alzheimers .org.  They have tons of resources, tips, telephone help-lines, pamphlets leaflets mini-workshop courses, etc etc.  There's one in our city, when my mum got her diagnosis we went there a few times, it was fantastic the assistance we received to gain knowledge about it, management tactics & techniques, etc.  

Sometimes I get my mum to shower (she CLAIMS she showered yesterday, i know it's been DAYS...) by tempting her with a ""new"" blouse or trousers.  ""Here look this new blouse we got you last week it's so pretty, you ought to try it on!  And hey, may as well take a quick shower while you're at it.  Wait, I'll jump in first, you go after me.""   And then I do actually jump in the shower real quick, while calling out to her ""are you ready to jump in after me?"".  But yeh, ""try this new blouse/whatever on!"" usually works.  

For the crossword puzzle - yes my mum also used to love doing them, but around since covid started they've got too hard for her.  I found some easier larger-print ones, but she does better with WordSearch these days.   Would your grandma enjoy those adult stress-release colouring books?  My mum doesn't like the mandala ones or some others, she likes the birds / flowers / gardens ones.  

Best of luck!

Alzheimers,Telling my father ‘no’ today,"My father has early-stage Alz. He is mostly with it, but there are fixations that he just can’t let go of. In this case, I have his .22 rifle. He has asked 20-30 times over the past couple of years that I bring his rifle. I have ‘forgotten’ it every time. My sister and I don’t think it’s a good idea for him to have a weapon. He not only has alz, but also a pretty severe tremor. Having a weapon with the amount he shakes would not be good. 
It feels like it’s time to be honest with him. His building does not allow weapons and he has a bad tremor. Bringing up the ALZ is a non-starter because he can’t see that he has it. 
I’m going to emphasize listening to him. Acknowledging his feelings on the whole thing. Telling him I love him. But no, I’m not bringing his rifle.  It’s going to be a hard day.

We took a trip in November for 5 days together for the first time in a long time. He was very with it. We bonded better than he have in a long time. I’m worried this is going to damage the closeness we have gained.  

I guess I’m conflicted. All the advice about alz is to lie to avoid conflict. Use this verbal judo to redirect the person. But that isn’t working either because he isn’t that far gone. He knows I’m lying to him, so that’s damaging our relationship too. 

Alz and parents getting older just sucks.","You have a couple aborts you can trot out:

His building doesn't allow it. You can't bring it.

Is his firearms license still current? If not, you can't bring it/leave it with him.
You have a lot of legit non alz reasons to not bring it. Could just go with those. 

Usually the ""white lie"" advice is for when they are so far gone they are incapable of catching it. When they don't remember even asking, and ask you over and over again. Like are they going to re-live discovering the death of their spouse, sibling, childhood friend multiple times, because they are incapable of remembering they even asked? That kind of thing. Or if the conversations are all circular, due to the disease (as opposed to an argumentative personality, for example). If they aren't that far gone, i wouldn't do it, it is demeaning. 

If they are just being difficult bc people can be difficult, then you use whatever other deflections, i guess. Gray rock. Having empathy. Whatever is appropriate, as long as you all can handle it. 

Because they also have a tremor though, i gotta ask.. Parkinsons? Or some other dementia cause has been ruled out?
There are times when we have to have the hard conversations. You come across as very empathetic and caring. You and your sister have his best interests at heart, lead with love. As you said there are legitimate reasons why having the weapon is not the best option. Particularly because he is not allowed to have one in his current home - u/smellygymbag is absolutely on point regarding ""white lies"" - it is usually a tactic used when the disease progression is further and telling your truth would just re-traumatize your LO. 

Alzheimer's is the devil, no question. I am so happy to hear though that your relationship has been growing closer, that is beautiful. I think that telling him the reasons as you stated them to us is the best strategy. 

I have used the same strategy many times with my stepfather - he is impaired but he is still pretty lucid. My stepfather was a bus driver for over 40 years - he also did some long haul trucking and when retired traveled in an RV around the US for several years. He prides himself on his driving - however 3 years ago I had to have the hard talk with him about him not being able to drive anymore. It wasn't easy and he was upset, but he respected that I told him the truth. Our relationship did strengthen because he trusted that I wasn't going to make up a story to avoid conflict.  

I am wishing you luck, hang in there!
Thanks all. 

The idea of using the white lies being premature is very helpful. There isn’t a manual for this crap and this really makes sense. 

We had a very difficult talk. He started with, if you didn’t bring my gun, sometime this week Karen(Step-mom) and I are going to come to your house and get it. A threat that showed me were he was at. (She won’t drive him to my house and he hasn’t driven since his license got pulled)

Karen and I both presented our worries. He was angry, despondent, and told us he resents us for not trusting him. And I understand that. From his perspective he IS a better driver than all of us. He IS perfectly capable of handling a rifle. The disease robs him of being able to see his shortcomings and that’s absolutely maddening. 

He did what he sometimes does. Announced it wasn’t worth talking about anymore and flipped into ‘regular dad’ mode. We watched an episode of Twilight Zone. I setup an Echo for them. We ate dinner. He gave me a big hug as I was leaving and told me he loved me. It was nice, normal, and weird. Like the conversation never happened. 

I know he will brood over this for days and weeks and months really. Part of me feels like I should push him to get angry. To face that he’s getting older. To crack the brooding depression he’s got. He refuses therapy. He’s fine. He’s not depressed. 

For now, I guess It went as well as it could. And I really don’t know how to help him find meaning in his life or get passed how we (his family) have taken away his driving and now the gun.
Bring it to a gunsmith and have them take out the firing pin.
Tell him you lost it.",2022-01-09 13:37:20,wittyexplore,rzy5zm
Alzheimers,Suggestions for hanging with mid-late stage early-onset friend?,"I've gotten back in touch with longtime friends I'd drifted from, and the husband is probably [stage 5-6 by this scale](https://www.healthline.com/health/stages-progression-alzheimers#stage-5) at the age of 59. I've been able to spend some time with him so she can go to appointments and such. He is still an absolute sweetheart and remembers me most visits, if not necessarily immediately, but his short-term memory is super-limited and he can't follow the complex narrative of a joke or a reminiscence and he doesn't respond well to new visuals. Mostly we sit and talk about the pretty view or their nice cats or how great we both are (like I said, absolute sweetheart), and occasionally we have a snack, which he loves. While I do think that this is a fairly soothing interlude for him, which is no bad thing, I'm wondering if there's anything people have found somebody at that level of Alzheimer's might enjoy that I'm not thinking of. Winter weather is foul here and he's afraid of the cold, so going outside isn't a possibility at the moment. Or maybe I should just stick to our hours of affectionate Zen?","That sounds lovely. If you’re looking for more things to do, you could try listening to music, dancing, coloring books, basic games, anything he liked to do as a child.
You are an absolute gem of a friend.  My mom had early onset at 60 and all but one friend ghosted them (of my parents’ long time ‘friends’).   That one friend would take my mom out to Wendy’s and then they’d deliver meals on wheels.  That doesn’t really help your situation though.  Just your offer to sit for respite is so welcome, I’m sure!
You can buy jigsaw pieces for adults but with 100 / 50 / less pieces. The Alzheimer's Society online shop sells some...and you can probably find them on Amazon etc. too. They're easy to do together but don't look patronising.
You might try getting a bunch of coffee-table type books (with mostly large gorgeous photos) from the library on a large variety of topics and see if any of are interest to him. Animals, Cars, Travel, etc. No reading necessary. They can spark conversation or just quiet enjoyment.
Puzzles (nothing more than 100 pieces)

Listening to music (The Beatles are my go to)

Sticker by number books like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Games-Sticker-Stickers-Beautiful/dp/1645581756/ref=asc_df_1645581756/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=509032833742&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10502607780223491618&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9001842&hvtargid=pla-1198081217018&psc=1)

Memory Lane Games trivia app is great.  The questions are super easy and the pictures are meant to encourage conversation

Sorting laundry (This one might be person specific, but my mother in law finds it relaxing to sort and match up socks.  I keep a laundry basked full of cheap colorful socks around for when she doesn’t know what to do with herself.)

Easy cards games or Donimoes
Snacks and music, for sure. My grandmother loved having something sweet (Ice Cream, especially) and just chilling. If music was on that was from her favorite era, she was grooving and as happy as can be. Sometimes I would ask her easy questions of things I knew she could talk on and then we were set. Hoping this helps, sounds like you're already doing a lot of this. You're a great friend!
Put some favorite old tunes on, if you can.  My guy and I both enjoy oldies.
My dad enjoys painting little wooden crafts (always on sale at Michael’s or hobby lobby). One of his friends who comes over a few times a month helps him bake simple treats (cut and bake cookies) to give my mom/have when she gets home. It makes both their day! 

If he does share any stories with you, it would be amazing if you kept them in your phone or wrote them down. His family may not have heard/may not hear those stories and they may be cherished in the future.
I love this [game](https://www.amazon.com/Pressman-Toys-0055J-Lets-Fishin/dp/B00004YO0Y).
Thanks, everyone, for the suggestions. They've given me a lot of possibilities. They're very special friends and I want to do right by them.
Try looking at old photos.  If they find that frustrating then stop.
So many good ideas.. But i gotta put in yet *another* vote for music. In fact if you can put together a couple of playlists (music from teens to 30s) for your friend and give it to the fam that could actually be a tremendous help to them later on, especially if you knew them from way back in the day. 

Its so nice of you to keep visiting. After a bit everyone starts to disappear, but i always felt like they might know youre ""an old friend"" even if they dont remember exactly who and it could be the highlight of the day. Or highlight of the week, or month even, as others start to lose interest. Thanks for hanging in there.",2022-01-08 15:50:44,sansabeltedcow,rz9ne0
Alzheimers,Diaper Hygiene Issues - Advice,"Hi everyone,

First time poster who has benefited a great deal from all the advice and support over the years reading through various posts and comments.

MIL has advanced Alzheimer's. We are having trouble with her bowel movements. She gets very constipated for a couple of days, during which time we give her Senekot, fiber gummies, milk of magnesia etc. Then she will void herself but the problem is that the timing of this is uncontrollable. We try to sit her on the toilet throughout the day but she does not understand the concept of pushing. 
On a few occasions she has voided herself in her diaper at night and then reaches in and pulls it out. Needless to say it is a big mess.  Last night was a really rough night for my FIL and we rushed over to try to help with the cleanup. Clean up involves trying to avoid her touching anything, disinfecting the entire bed area, while also getting her into the bath which as you know is another big challenge for ALZ patients. We do notice that she is constantly reaching into her pants at night. Any suggestions for how we could solve this problem? We are going to play around with the times of day when we give her the laxative but it seems as if she is not on the schedule at all with her bowel movements.Thanks in advance for any suggestions you might have.","My father in law wears a kind of jumpsuit garment  under his clothes that prevents him from reaching into his pants. It zips in the back so he can't undo it himself. Maybe something like this? Especially at night if that's the problem time.
A bedside commode can make the trip to the toilet faster and easier and the space around her is more easily controlled.  You can lay out newspaper, or barrier pads underneath as well. Using barrier cream after each incontinent episode is important.  Get a basin with soapy water to use near the bedside commode so you don't have to do a full bath if you can get away with it.  There is a rinse free peri wash that I really love.  A few squirts, wipe with the disposable wash cloths to remove soil, then a quick scrub and pat dry. I have found that full baths are not pleasant for dementia patients.  Making the bathroom warm and utilizing a shower chair will really help.

Many women who have had children can lose their tone to push, which makes things harder to move out. You might find a bisacodyl or glycerin suppository at bedtime might provide results by morning so having one major clean up might really help your day.  Fiber gummies are terrible for elderly people who may have trouble swallowing and that would be a less safe option for her. 

If her hands are busy, put something in them.  A disposable glove on her hand with a washcloth, for example.

If she is restless at night and does not stop playing with her diaper, I'd talk to the doctor about getting something to settle her down.  She isn't comfortable and it could be due to ""sundowning agitation"" which can be treated and improve her quality of life.

I think the problem is you are waiting for her to get constipated, then giving her laxatives.

Try this:  1. A capful of Miralax (generic is cheaper) in morning coffee or other beverage.  Plus 2. A glassful of psyllium husk in water, orange juice, or some brands come orange-flavored, just add water.  Plus if stools are too hard, 3. add a stool softener pill (sodium docusate)  at bedtime.

The goal is regularity, not cycles of constipation/laxatives.  Also, if she ever takes a narcotic for pain, maybe up the dose of the above slightly.  If she is eating extra fresh fruit (like when it's in season) maybe cut back slightly, still doing the above but less.

This is working pretty well for my spouse, and I do it too.  

I hope this helps!
Read the label on the meds, they usually take 6-12 or more hours to work. So maybe the dosing should be done with/after dinner, in hopes of an AM BM?  Does her medical team have any ideas for Rx?  Or maybe she could benefit from a consultation with a gastro.  It's possible she could be prescribed something that'd have more predictable results. 

Have you tried pajamas that'd preclude her from being able to reach down into her pants?  Thinking like adult one-piece feety pajamas..?  But I realize the nightmare that may induce in trying to get a late-stage AD patient into single-piece pajamas...
I keep a glass full of water for my wife and it helps making her regular. I just have to coach her to go.
Timing of the medication is important here, but so is spending enough time on the toilet. And already mentioned: try to stabilise her movements. 

Most of our patients get washed and brushed etc while sitting on the toilet, so that they get enough time to go, without just making them sit for 30 minutes. 
Writing down what the subtle clues are helps too: unrest, walking, emotions changing, pulling on clothes, searching in cupboards, waddling, touching the stomach, frowning etc. That is probably a good time to offer a bathroom visit. 

Lastly: has she been checked for UTIs, and infections? Fecal incontinence ofcourse introduces a great deal of bacteria, and patients often can't say what's up. Itchy crotch should probably be checked out. Could just be skin irritation, but that would still benefit from a protective cream.",2022-01-08 09:19:17,WeirdFarmer5530,rz0uvv
Alzheimers,Celebrating a birthday,My mom turned 60 today and she is suffering from early onset Alzheimers. She had her diagnoses at 54 so we are in this hell for 6 years now. We all didn't expect her to make it to this birthday. But now she has and I feel really terrible. Every time she has a birthday or I have mine I miss her. The woman she was before the illness. How do you celebrate a birthday with this kind of situation. Because of covid there are only 4 people who can visit her today. So 2 of my aunts and my oldest brother and my stepdad are going there today and I feel like I should go to her but I'm also scared. She's not the woman I want to remember when she passes away. Is that selfish from me? I don't know what to do,"First off, it's not selfish of you at all. This is a really cruel illness and it's perfectly natural to feel like that. 

My mum's also suffering from early onset. She was diagnosed when she was 58 and she's now 64. The first few years were ok but this last year has been the roughest. She moved into a care home earlier this year and she just isn't my mum any more. 

When we went into the home to visit her on her birthday this year, she had absolutely no idea that it was her birthday and couldn't really focus on her presents or anything. Christmas (well, Christmas Eve was when we visited) was much the same, only she was even more scattered.

If it helps, don't focus on the fact that it's her birthday. Just focus on having a good visit with her. If she happens to know that it's her birthday (I don't know how far advanced she is) then cool, if not, don't worry about it. If she's happy and relaxed, then that's a good visit, regardless of how aware she is.

Another thing which might help, which may be somewhat controversial, is don't think of her as your mum. I know that feels like an awful thing to think about your own parent but the fact is, she's not the woman that you know and had a relationship with. She's someone else now, someone who used to be the woman you know. Just focus on having a nice visit with the woman who is in the room with you. 

I'm only saying that because I've found it useful when visiting my own mother. It just about kills me every time I visit her because she's most certainly *not* my mum anymore. It feels like my mum is already dead and this is just the woman in her place. Separating the woman she is now from the woman I know and love is a little easier to deal with in the moment. It doesn't really help in the long run but it helps me power through each visit. 

Then I go and cry and scream when I'm alone in the car.
It’s not selfish at all. My therapist told me I need to grieve the mom I once had because she’s not the same woman. Then build a new kind of relationship with the current version of your mom. I haven’t come to terms with it but in trying
Go visit her and celebrate with some of her favorite food. Maybe bring and listen to her favorite music and show her pictures of family, the older the better. 

If you visit and are with her regularly then the progress doesn't seem to rapid.
You can't bring back the past but you can be there right now on her birthday. Be with your mom as she is now in the present moment. When she is gone you don't want to have memories of avoiding her on her birthday when she needed you the most.
You celebrate it like any other birthday.  Gifts (little things), cards, birthday cake, singing Happy Birthday, blowing out a single candle (maybe on a separate cupcake), balloons.

Privately you can be mournful, but with your mom, just celebrate.
We’re in nearly identical situations; my dad’s birthday was yesterday. He had no idea it was his birthday, but we reminded him. We gifted him some new slippers and had cupcakes at dinner. Very low key and emotionally challenging, but also a way for it to feel almost ‘normal’ for a few minutes. I’m sorry you’re going through this too.
My mom also just turned 60 and has early onset Alzheimer’s. She didn’t really know it was her birthday but I tried to give her a good day. It’s hard because she is loosing the ability to talk, she doesn’t know how to say what she wants anymore. At this point I’m glad if we can connect about anything so if I find something she likes we do it over and over again. Last time it was picking out shirts at the store, she really really wanted to pick out shirts and I buy them for her and she’d want to go do it again so we did. I have definitely had grieve the mom I have lost, I miss her so much. I have become a lot closer with two of her sisters because talking to them reminds me of talking to my mom. It really helps me feel like I have somewhere to go for that “mom talk” that I miss having with my mom.",2022-01-07 10:38:00,Silver-Star92,rya6db
Alzheimers,Options For Veterans in Mid-to-Late Stage Alzheimer's,"I'm wondering what options, if any, an elderly US military veteran has as their Alzheimer's progresses, and they get worse. Does the government pay or partly pay for assisted living, or veteran's home stay depending on the state? If not, what other options do they have for care and assisted living?

The VA of the current state I'm in told me they do not allow Alzheimer's patients to stay in a veteran's nursing home, and they only offer caregiving services for a few measly hours a week once the patient is no longer able to dress or bathe themselves, which my loved one is fortunately still able to do, but who knows when that will end? Thank you all.","Supposedly, my dad's years in the Air Force qualified my mom for VA Aid & Attendance after his death. We were told it's a way to pay for home care aides or assisted living for all vets and their spouses. After applying, being told she qualified, waiting and waiting due to office shut downs from COVID, we never did hear another word and she passed away so it's too late now.

But Aid and Attendance is the program to look into.
Regarding having the costs of assisted living covered I can tell you what I know from my recent experiences.

Step 1 is enrolling in VA healthcare:  [https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction](https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction)

Depending on when the veteran served they may be automatically eligible for benefits but otherwise their assistance will be determined by financial income -  see the link I provided, it will walk you through all of that.

You will need a copy of their discharge papers (DD214) which i had to request from the national archives and took several weeks for my Dad's

Step 2 if the veteran does not qualify automatically or based on financial needs then you can still get a disability rating for the veteran based on working with your state/local VA hospital - you will need to locate an accredited VSO (Veterans Service Organizations) representative that would require an appointment with a VA physician to evaluate the veteran and assign them a disability rating.   This step is to determine if the veteran's current state of health is in any way a result of something that happened while they were enlisted in the armed forces.  

&#x200B;

If the VSO can tie any of the veteran's disability to something they experienced while serving, then they will assign a disability rating whose value would determine the percentage of health care costs that the VA would cover.  

&#x200B;

It's the government, so don't expect anything to move quickly.  I've been waiting 2 months to hear back from the VSO for my Dad and every time i call it goes to voicemail or he's 'with someone else' according to the people that answer.  Good luck!
I believe that my fiancée Father, a Vietnam Veteran has EOAD. He's a great man. We're visiting him and I immediately noticed a difference. This is my fiancée step father since she was 5, so that pretty much makes him DAD to her. 
He's married and his wife is trying her best but,  has said that if he starts to get violent she will put him in a home which at that point he would most likely have Zero Rights.  (I could be wrong)

My fiancée wants to push to get some sort of rights,  like power of attorney, so that she could speak with doctors about treatment and general updates on how he doing etc but doesn't want to ""ruffle any feathers"" with his wife. 

(3 questions)

1) Is there any way she can get Dual Power of Attorney? I'm new to all this and I don't know. 

2) a year ago I was looking at stocks and came across Cassava Sciences and thier A.D. drug Simufilam. Does any one know anybody that has gone thru clinical trials with it? Or have spoken to a doctor about it? 

I live in AZ and her father in Nevada. I believe they do tests in clinical trial treatments in Tempe AZ. I'm going to push and see if they'd be willing to try

3) Does anyone know what the VA prescribes to Veterans who have Alzheimerz? 


Any information helps! Thank you very much. 


P.S. I found this about Cassava Sciences drug Simufilam, not sure how useful it is but here it is:

The nursing home thing may be a consequence of the type of facility they have available. Like some facilities (for elderly in general), will sort of do baby sitting, tops. Some won't administer medicine. Some are not allowed to restrain patients, or stop them from leaving if they wander off. Maybe you could find out if there are facilities a bit farther away they could refer him to? 

Also, as he progresses (as in becomes immobile), then it might be a different story. My mom never wanted to have my dad in a home, but at some point he was sick enough that the military hospital in my state would take him. She didnt want to, but she could have. 

I dont think they paid for day care... I think the county paid for that partially.. But they did have a 10k stipend for home modifications to make it safer for him (ramp and bars and stuff), and they did give a monthly stipend of a couple thousand to him, which would then be used to pay for the part of day care that county didnt pay for. The amount a county or state will help out can vary greatly by county. 

My dad was 100% disabled or covered or whatever the description was. He was a korean war vet. The amount of benefit you get may depend on the age or when they served. The doc who helped us navigate this said that the older ones may get more help faster, because the govt knows they dont have as long to live anyway :p.",2022-01-07 01:38:13,justgui7766,ry0zuw
Alzheimers,Refusing help,"My grandmother is 88 years old and lives in a separate house on our property. She's been diagnosed with ""moderate"" alzheimers and the doctor said she should really go to a nursing home but she refuses and we're ok with her living at home as long as it's possible, although we'd wish she would go to a nursing home for everyone's sake.

She doesn't take care of herself (hasn't washed her hair in god knows how long), doesn't take her meds cause she's suspicious of what they are (we bring her the medication twice a day but she cheeks them and spits it out), feeds her cat random things and doesn't clean the litter box so now we do these things for her as we don't want to take away her companion, she either refuses/forgets to eat or eats more than 1 loaf of bread a day and even cat food and shes incredibly stubborn, verbally aggressive, thinks we steal from her all the time, etc.

She doesn't want any help with cleaning, bathing, cooking, anything. She even gets mad that we help with her cat cause it makes it seem like she's old for goodness sake. She won't go see our family doctor for her prescriptions unless we force her to and we've tried having him come to the house but she just locks the doors and leaves the key on the door so we can't get in. It's miserable.

Another thing is that she's costing us a lot of money atm. She keeps breaking her tv by messing with the cables, unplugging them and then trying to plug them in incorrectly resulting in having to get it fixed cause she messes up the ports. She also messed something up on her toilet causing the water to keep running for 14 days resulting in a €1000 water bill. Besides that she always turns off all the lights and sits in the dark 24/7 to save money. Literally whenever we go check on her she's sitting on a chair in her kitchen -lights out- curtains closed - pitch black. 

Any advice??","Her dementia has progressed too far for her to be living alone any longer.  You're also giving her too many liberties.  Like the Rx -- she shouldn't even have the possibility to hide it in her mouth and then spit it out after you look away.  If you're bringing her the Rx and she has dementia, the onus is on you to make sure she's actually taking the Rx.  Once you figure out a process for ensuring she's taking the Rx, the doctor can prescribe different things that may/can help with the pugnacious personality (this is kind of a hallmark of Alzheimer's/dementia, so it won't likely be medicated away in full).  Whether she moves into your home or into a nursing home, she needs more attention and assistance...whether she likes it or not.
So sorry OP that sounds like a real nightmare!  She needs to go residential.   Her doctor is right.  If you let her continue like this, as it actually already is sort of a 'wilful neglect' scene,  it will be an 'elder abuse' sort of scenario coming soon.  *She is already lost capacity, has not the capacity to care for herself nor make decisions regarding her care.*  So very sorry, it's really tough, and sad, I feel for you.   But you all are allowing her to push you along on her agenda because it's the easiest thing for y'all to do now, because the enormity of going against her, & 'putting her' in a residential facility, you don't want to face.  Sorry, I'm not mincing words here.  

You won't be ok with finding her smeared her poop all over the walls when you have to call an ambulance or emergency responders because she's locked herself inside for 3 days & you can't get in there, & she's fallen down broken a hip & can't get up & they find that you've been letting her eat cat food & there's overflowing kitty-litter-poop-box.  Or when she electrocutes herself & sets the house on fire.  

You can not manage her in your home either - she will not behave differently, living in your home with you.  Y'all are not professional experienced experts in elder care & dementia management.  

 Sorry but, *my advice, is to follow the professionals, her doctors advice*.  You can't continue to let her live like that, She needs to go residential asap.     \* hugs \*    Best of luck!
When we moved my mom into memory care, she was eating about 8 bananas a day, making coffee but forgetting to put the cup or pot under it, so the coffee just went all over the counter and onto the floor. She was eating at least 8 sweetened yogurts a day and a full baguette. I'd cook for her, but she'd give it to her dogs and cat. If it wasn't bread, fruit yogurt, or a banana, she wouldn't eat it most of the time.

Was she happy with us selling her home and moving her? Not at all, and then something happened. She got kicked out of the first place we chose as she kept wandering and the nurses kept missing the alarm going off when the door opened. Her next place was fantastic. She was reserved, but about three-four months into it, I stopped by to visit her and she told me she loved seeing me, but she had plans with her friend, so could I come back later.
It sounds like a very difficult situation, my heart goes out to you and your family. I have worked in long term care for over 15 years and I have seen just about every kind of scenario that you can imagine. Yes, you want to respect your grandmother's personhood and honor her right to live as she chooses. However, the situation you are describing is dangerous - I have struggled personally with my biological father in a similar situation. In the end we had to get POA and admit him to a care facility because he was putting himself in danger. We tried home care first, he would lock the nurses out or cuss them out - we finally had to make the decision for a nursing home. It was not easy and it was stressful for everyone, but safety and quality of life is the most important right now.

At this point your grandmother is not competent and cannot make rational or reasonable decisions. I completely understand that you want to keep her at home, but the current situation is obviously not working for any of you.
Stop replacing or repairing her t.v.  Turn off the water to her toilet, tell her it's broken, and give her a composting toilet to use instead.  

That's just to keep the bills in line.

Her stubbornness is a survival instinct.  She's survived this long by doing things the hard way and in a sense, that's one reason she has lived this long.  You can't force medical attention on her, so if she wants to die a few years early by not taking her blood pressure medication (or whatever), who's to argue?

Prepare healthy food for her and leave it.  When it's too old, take it away.  Ask if you can brush the cat.  Then ask if you can clean the litter box.  Tell her what a pretty cat it is and what is its name?  Arrange for some people from church or the senior center to pay her a short social visit.

Eventually she will die in her sleep, or she will have a stroke or broken hip or something.  Then she will go in hospital, and believe me, she will never be released to home again, it will be straight to nursing home.
If you get a guardianship with her you will have more legal rights on terms of protecting her from herself.
I would call the Alzheimer’s association in your country and ask for their advice. Does your country have Adult Protective services? in the US that’s who we call when someone (usually seniors or disabled but not always) is seriously living in squalor and unable to maintain their home to the point of creating danger to themselves and others. The fire department non-emergency number may also direct you where to go.",2022-01-07 02:48:29,Pruts93,ry22pf
Alzheimers,Maybe morbid to some.,Has anyone donated their loved ones brains after they passed away. I honestly don’t know how much longer my husband has and have been thinking about this as an option. I would hope that just maybe we could contribute to getting rid of this awful disease.,"Not at all.  We are also considering.  To an approved place specifically for Alz research.  Good luck.
I tried so hard to find places that would want to take my dad's brain (he was even a first responder at Ground Zero and part of the health study) and I couldn't find anyone. Unfortunately he passed before we could find any options
I posted here asking this question few weeks ago. We are also considering it. partially to get some final answer as to which dementia, and hopefully how long ago it’s been affecting her.
Heres some options: 

https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/research_progress/brain-donation

But, if those are inconvenient to you, you may want to find out if theres a medical school near you that would also take a donation. They may need all kinds, for their anatomy labs. Its helping to train future doctors, so it does help community, and sometimes they will also do a nice, maybe annual, no cost group memorial service for all the donors and their families.
We asked about donating it at our local university, but were told unless you enrolled in their research project and had multiple brain scans, they wouldn't take it.  I had already decided not to help my spouse go to any more research projects due to the driving, parking, waiting around, etc. adding to my caregiver burden.  

I think there are several brain banks around the U.S.   You could inquire at those after looking them up on Google.  Different institutions may have different policies.

I don't find your post morbid at all.
There's honestly almost no point in doing this unless they were in a clinical trial looking at an experimental therapy or a longitudinal study that includes path.  Otherwise there's no need for the clinicopathologic correlate, because the clinical features will not be documented in a standardized manner and because we already know the correlates: plaques and tangles.  If there are confounders, like your husband was a football player, then it might not have been AD at all, but an AD mimic. 

If you need to know, then it'll cost about 1000 dollars.

We wanted to, but they said that where my mom lived they didn't have any program available.
I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. We donated my mother’s brain to a major hospital (same one her brother’s brain was donated to) but as someone pointed out, they didn’t seem to need it too much because she wasn’t in a clinical trial so we had to cover the transportation costs ourselves. I’m not sure how much use they had for it, but knowing our mom, she would have wanted to do everything she could to help change the future for others. Don’t feel guilty if you don’t end up donating though because I think transportation costs were a few hundred dollars. If the patient had been in a clinical trial, it would usually be covered.",2022-01-05 19:20:57,kathy11358,rx16vp

Alzheimers,Brightening your person's day,"I find it is easier to ""manage"" my spouse with Alzheimer's if I can keep him in a good mood.  To this end, I will do things I know he gets enjoyment from.  Such as:

* Eating out, or in Covid times, just eating at a drive-in (I call it ""going for a burger with my honey"")
* Any kind of gift - even though we are downsizing, got him some new gloves at Christmas which pleased him
* Grooming the cats
* Watching an interesting drama on TV

I love this post! We watched the movie “Benji” on Netflix with my dad last night and he LOVED it, didn’t fall asleep once (it’s a kids film but who cares). Also a fancy hot chocolate makes him happy, me helping him tidy his sheds, having him tell me long stories about his summer jobs, when he saw The Beatles perform in 1962 and that he wore white jeans that night. Thank you for this post.
My dad loves wilderness and survival shows; my mom recently discovered the National Geographic streaming app and she said it’s the most peace she could buy for $10/month! :) She also has found that giving him an alcohol-free beer (he can’t read the label) makes him feel good; having a beer after work was one of his most consistent routines. For me, it’s bringing my cat home for visits. She gets plenty of brushing when she hangs out with him, bless her heart.
Picnics in various places.  Esky with various colourful / old-favourites finger-foods to make a grazing-plate.   Extra points for parks / beachside / NatParks with plenty dog-walkers or kiddies playground (mum is ex-elementary school teacher) she enjoys watching.  

Browsing thrift-stores - in between covid-waves, that is, on non-crowded days/times.  Buying some cheap fun trinket & a book / magazines.  

Watching Shaun The Sheep cartoons or the movie.  Funnily enough, a few other carers of folk in her dementia-group have also mentioned that their memory-lossed LO likes Shaun the Sheep.  (The first one only - the #2, Farmageddon, with the alien, she doesn't get at all, the alien is too weird & the story is lame).

Mr Bean / Johnny English movies.   Black Adder series 1, & 2, are the favourites.
My mom will always start dancing if I put on some Motown music. And she just loves when we go thrift shopping (little shop down the street with limited hours), followed by Taco Bell drive thru for a single taco. She helps me remember it's the simple things that can make life enjoyable. Thanks for the post.
My grandma absolutely loves sex and the city. I turn it on every night for her and she thinks it's a treat. I cannot count how many times we've watched the entire series now but she doesn't remember and it makes her happy
Love your post OP and all who posted too.

Love your positive attitudes.

Enjoy these happy moments with your loved ones.
It's funny - this is almost the same list of ""happy things"" I use to keep my father out of the doldrums - my mother is the one with dementia. They've been married for 66 years and now that she's in a MC facility it's better for both of them but also really difficult - they did EVERYTHING together. He's really lost without her even though he sees her almost every day. When Dad gets in a mood, I do one of these things - but substitute ""Gunsmoke"" for Carol Burnett and ""brushing the dogs"" instead of a cat. This is a GREAT post!
I used to play cards with my grandpa, when he was still alive. After being diagnosed with Alzheimer's, his computational skills went through the roof so I've taken advantage of. His memory seemed to benefit from these sessions, and his temper too.",2022-01-04 16:00:00,UnsightlyFuzz,rw4l3f
Alzheimers,I don't know how much more I can take.,"Mum got diagnosed around May last year. We think she's had it since late 2016 though. I just can't deal with her anymore. I love her because she's my mum but by god I just can't stand her anymore. Walking around the house muttering to herself how we're all assholes. 

Her dog (lab) I love her to bits, but she likes to get in my daughter's face when she has food or is upset or has just woken up and when I tell her to back up my mum loses her ever loving mind. Like I have some kind of vendetta against this dog? I love this dog. She's great. But she's a puppy and doesn't understand boundaries. Still working on it though and my daughter is 19 months old. 

I guess all the shit I do for her doesn't matter at all. I have no clue why I'm the bad guy constantly in her eyes but I can't take it anymore. I'm a single mum and I'm struggling to keep my head above water for my daughter. Nothing is ever enough. I'm working on moving out and in the meantime I have to work out how to keep walking on eggshells and not snap at her. Because then I'll definitely be the world's worst person because mum has Alzheimer's and she can't defend herself according to everyone around her.

I'm not posting for advice. Just to vent.","God, me too. My mother was transformed from a sweet, doting mom to this mean, hateful, violent, petulant old woman. Every day, there was at least one moment where I just wanted to throttle her and scream, ""give me my mother back, you soulless piece of shit!""  


It's hard to remember, and pretty much impossible to take comfort in, the fact that she is not coming from a place of peace, love and understanding; most Alzheimers patients are aware of their own declining mentality on some level, and they are in a place of fear, confusion, paranoia, and a general inability to coherently express themselves. As a therapist told me: Hurt people hurt people. This is even more true with dementia.
I really feel you. My mom is in a nursing home now so I’m past that phase but I remember the frustration that went along with it. I love my mom too but ooh sometimes I genuinely felt like I’d snap and strangle her. It wasn’t her fault - she didn’t know what was happening. Still was an awful feeling though. 

Have you looked into aging and disability centers near you? I used to work at one and it was very common to see Alzheimer’s patients and their caretakers getting additional help with things.
The person who has Alzheimer's is having to accept (or be in denial of!) many losses.  The ability to think, the respect of other people, even abilities to carry out any purposeful action.  I think when Alz. patients are obnoxious, it is often a misdirected anger at this ultimate indignity of old age.

Sometimes I have had to say to my guy, ""Well don't take it out on ME!  I never wanted you to have this disease!""  And when he's in a better mood, he apologizes for being ""such an asshole"" (his exact words).

Maybe it would help if you can try to identify with her hurt, loss, and anger.  Like saying ""it must be aggravating to have other people make decisions for you these days.""  I know you weren't asking for advice, so please view this as a different perspective, rather than a prescription.
Not sure if this helps, but please understand she's likely taking out her own fear and frustrations on you. As my mother has continued to decline and lose her independence and agency, guess who gets blamed for it? 

When she stopped being able to make her own food because she can't be trusted to not walk away with the stove on, or leave the refrigerator door standing wide open, she responded by insisting she never did these things and I was being a controlling asshole.

There are many examples, but it all boils down to her being angry, scared, humiliated, and frustrated about losing her independence, and lashing out at us (my wife and I) because of it. I try not to blame her, but in the moment when I'm getting yelled at, it's hard but to become angry myself.

Hang in there.
Please understand that this isn’t her. It’s the illness speaking. Try not to take her words into account, she really doesn’t know what she’s doing. And maybe is so frustrated by the situation, that she can’t control her emotions. I guess it isn’t pleasing to sense that something is very wrong with you and you are losing yourself.
Maybe if someone helps with the dog and taking care of your mother? Do you have options for an assistant? Stay strong!
This is painfully familiar, and it's also unfortunately something that probably everyone in this sub can empathize with.  

**It's going to be hard, but you need to realize that your mom and this disease aren't the same thing.  This disease is slowly taking control and despite all of our best efforts, there's nothing that can be done about it.**  

My mom's continued to be pretty even-keeled with me and my brothers over the past couple years, but as I articulated in a recent post here, she's downright ***miserable*** to my Dad and it's heartbreaking.  We all know at this point to not take personally anything she says because she genuinely doesn't know what she's talking about.  (Even with all this in mind, I don't know how my Dad could not be completely crushed by the weight and pressure of it all sometimes.  He's not an emotional person and he's not particularly graceful, but seeing how admirable he's been through all this to this point has been inspiring.  I'd like to think I'd stick by my wife in the same way if the time came, but I honestly don't trust myself to be so strong and resilient.) 

And as already mentioned, that dog is about to become someone else's liability and responsibility, so you may as well start planning for that now.  Perhaps your Mom's still capable of caring for the dog, but you'd be best prepared now for the time comes when she can't anymore.
what state do you live in? how old is mom?

I think it’s time to work on getting her into assisted living or at least home care outside of your house. Toddlers are also difficult! But a toddler can’t do that much physical damage and also can’t write a check. Sadly mom’s temper tantrums will get more frequent soon; not less.
The worst is feeling the anger and on top of that the guilt for the anger.  We’re use to some expectation of fairness in our interactions and that just doesn’t exist when dealing with dementia does it?  
My Mom lived with vascular dementia for several years before she passed. No personality change. At the same time my Dad had dementia associated with Parkinson’s. Huge personality change. It hurt-a lot- to be talked to and treated they way he did. One day while crying with hurt and frustration my sweet SIL gave me the best advice I’ve ever had. She hugged me and said firmly “you have to just let it roll over you. Don’t take it in, just let it roll over and off of you”. She had creditability as she had been sole support for her Mom. And she isn’t at all a passive person, always fighting her corner and quick to engage if she felt wronged. This strong willed person had been given a gift for coping. It was an epiphany  for me. I didn’t know then I’d need this gift for coping way more going forward. My husband (56 years this month) was diagnosed shortly afterwards. He’s now in mid stage AZD.  You’ll see me standing still and repeating “just let it roll over. Let it roll on”. It truly does help me. 
I hope for you an epiphany or mantra or chant or prayer you can find that gives you strength and a coping shield.
I feel all of that. I have one suggestion, if you haven't already made plans talk to the local shelters. Someone is going to have to take that dog eventually if you or another family member can't, and shelters can have long waiting lists for surrenders. When we had to take my mom's dogs, it took more than six months. During that time, I trained him as best I could, but he absolutely hated my cats and if you put him in a crate, something he'd never experienced, he screamed non-stop. One of my cats has asthma and the stress was making his health worsen, so it became extremely stressful on all of us having to lock away the cat to avoid putting the puppy in a crate.",2022-01-04 03:37:04,jamie_jamie_jamie,rvppa1
Alzheimers,Pre-Mourning,"Preface: My grandmother was diagnosed about 4 years ago and has slowly progressed.  I have not physically seen her in a year. We took her to the hospital for a fall and she has been in assisted living since. I've attempted to visit her only one time and was turned away due to the worlds current events. 

My family has been nearly begging me to go see her. My brother recently went and called in tears telling me I HAD to go see her and that she wasn't getting any better. But mentally I have not felt able to make that move as I was always the closest to her. In a way safe guarding my younger self and memories. Due to my family's pleas I know I will need to see her soon. I began writing a eulogy today for her. And I can't tell my family, husband or friends because quite frankly it is so extremely morbid. But I wrote and got all of the thoughts and memories that I know when the time comes I want people to know. I think this is my brain's way of memorializing or cementing the person she was and is to me so that when I go to see her it's as if maybe she's a different person and doesn't cloud the previous memories.","With dementia it's not even pre-mourning, is IS mourning. You're grieving the person you knew and loved, and grieving the relationship you had with them.

I'm grieving for my mother. She moved into a care home back in April and she is absolutely not my mother anymore. She doesn't know who anybody is and can't even say a whole sentence which makes any sense. 

But I still have to visit her every week. Because she's still my mum, even though my mum is dead and has been replaced with this thing that only slightly resembles her.

My instinct is to pretend like she's already dead, to not visit her because what's the point when she doesn't know who I am or even that she knows me. That's the instinct telling me to protect myself because it hurts so much every time I see her. Every visit is killing me, just a little bit at a time.

But I keep visiting. Because somewhere in there, she's my mum.

So yeah, I can completely understand why you don't want to visit. It's perfectly natural.
This last year I've been doing this a lot. My grandmother was in care for dementia for the past 4 years; she passed away last September. Meanwhile, my dad's been devolving through Alzheimers since at least 2017, and he's currently in care.

I was home over the summer, and my mom basically insisted that I go and see her before the end. I relented, and saw her, mostly because I couldn't bring myself to explain why I didn't want to.

It was heartbreaking; she was emaciated (she was 99, and refusing food), and desperately confused. I don't think she knew who I was, or cared. She kept asking for (name), which could have been either her son, or her husband. She desperately didn't want to be in the care ward, and kept begging me to take her away from there. That was her only focus. I had to duck out after maybe 10 minutes, because I couldn't take it anymore. It was everything I was afraid it would be.

For my dad, seeing his deterioration over the last few years, I've reconciled in my head that the father I knew and loved is basically deceased already; his body just doesn't know it yet. There's the odd glimmer, but for 99% of the time, he's gone, and those glimmers are fewer and farther between.

I don't see the eulogy as morbid; the intent is always to stir the memories of those who knew and loved them. Keep the memories you have alive, and share them with friends or family.I still cherish and revel in the memories of my grandparents and parents.

If you can't talk to your family (and I get why), I do encourage you talk to someone, be it a counselor, or even just a close friend. (If a friend, be sure to ask before you dump an emotional load on them; I've been on the receiving end of that, and it's unpleasant.) It's not good to bottle and let this fester.
I did this for my mother, in the last 6 months of her life, or so. I even rehearsed it in my head while at work. Even mentally wrote an obituary.
There is a BIG difference between where she is now and her being dead forever.  She is here now, no matter what her condition. You can hear her voice, hold her hands, kiss her cheek, look in her eyes, etc. You won't realize how much you still have right now until she is totally gone forever and you have nothing. Once she is gone you may feel like you would give anything just to be able to hug her again. 

She is still your grandmother even with her brain disease. You can still love her even if she is confused or doesn't know who you are. You do that because she is not a different person even if she acts like one. I can't imagine wanting to walk into her room pretending she's someone different. The whole reason to go is because she's the grandmother that you know and love. And you want her to have some love and TLC whether she knows who you are or not. I find it  heartbreaking when people with dementia are abandoned by family and friends because the family and friends want to avoid negative emotions for themselves. This is part of life. And that doesn't seem like real love or friendship to me.
Thank you for posting this. I just joined this group a few minutes ago specifically for these types of issues, for which I need support and to compare notes. It is my mom who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s a few months ago. But I was prepared because I’ve known for awhile based on my observations. I will say more at a later time, but for now it’s so painful to put my feelings into words.",2022-01-04 05:13:25,addiedeebee,rvr2o4
Alzheimers,NHS appreciation post,"Living with grandma for 4 years. After she fell, the paramedics came out to clean her head injury. 
They sent out someone who stitched her up in bed so she wouldn’t get freaked out having to go to hospital. 
They put us onto a therapist who came out for 6 weeks and did specific exercises with her to improve her balance.  
They put us in contact with a social worker who would ring me every so often to see if I had any problems. 
They’ve been talking to the district nurses on my behalf. I didn’t know about this until Christmas Eve. 
They’re going to send someone out one morning for the next 6 weeks. Will wake, wash, dress and feed her so I can have some time off.
How much does this cost? £0. 
[NHS: Free at the point of delivery](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england/the-nhs-constitution-for-england) I 💙 it. And it needs protecting.","Awww....  I'm not in the UK, but we hear so much railing against the NHS, it's nice to see some appreciation.  Best wishes to you.
The NHS is the single-most amazing thing in the UK but it’s overloaded, my mum has been waiting for an assessment by our local mental health assessment team Warwickshire and has yet to be seen, she’s living on her own and my sister cares for her daily ensuring she’s taking her medication and eating something other than jam sandwiches and does the washing, She generally just potters about the house moving things around but there has been newer incidents like going for a wonder as the dog died recently, she thinks we’ve either sold her or shes lost.
Can you point me in the right direction for those exercises?",2022-01-03 15:26:35,Bolehillbilly,rvb4g3
Alzheimers,Trying to work with siblings,"Hello, looking for some advice.  I have been trying to work with my siblings in terms of support our parent who has Alzheimer’s.  The road leading up to the diagnosis revealed how poorly we do work together, but I’ve tried my best ignore the crap and snark and support my parent as best as I can.  However, the control and gaslighting from the siblings has become too much for me, it has affected my mental health.  I pulled out of group texts with them and said I will communicate via email to support our parent, but will no longer deal with them in other ways.  All the time I strongly reiterated that in NO WAY was I stopping helping our parent.  Now the email communication has also become borderline abusive - especially if I am not in agreement with something.  For example, I think a place different levels of care is what should be considered so we don’t have to move our parent when the Alzheimer’s progresses more care is required.
Part of me wants to go no contact with the siblings and help my parent when they need it, not in consultation with the siblings.  Thoughts?
This puts my parent in the middle so to speak, but trying to work with the siblings and maintain a decent level of mental health is almost unattainable.
Thanks","Well, who is the principal caregiver?  If it's you, ignore the rest of them.

This siblings-in-the-peanut-gallery effect is very common in care for an aging parent.  Everyone's a critic!
Who has POA? If it is you alone, and you are not requesting assistance from the siblings, then there is no real reason to consult them on details.
I haven’t spoken to my younger brother in over three years because of this BS. He refused to help, financially or just by spending time with my mom to give me a break- claims he’s broke, and his MS prevents him from doing almost anything. 

Meanwhile, he bought himself some land, a trailer, atvs and dirt bikes, the list goes on- and the MS doesn’t stop him making the 3 hour drive to ride his atvs most weekends. 

When we were in contact, he had the balls to comment all the time on things he wasn’t helping with. 

In the end, you have to focus on what matters- caring for yourself and your parent- and find a way to minimize the bullshit. People really show their true colors when times get tough, be proud of the colors you’re showing while they show theirs.
Is your parent aware of the tension or are they too far gone? Sounds to me like you are doing the best thing now, of all your options. I am and have been in a somewhat similar situation. The siblings are lashing out intentionally, and it seems like this has gone on now for a while. Frankly, you don’t have an obligation to continue accepting that kind of abuse. Nor should you. Try and make peace with your parent, take that win, and be prepared to move forward without them. If the dysfunction is really that bad (which is common), then it’s ok to move on. My 2 cents.",2022-01-03 19:52:15,No_Bee_8674,rvh2lu
Alzheimers,"Upstairs, Downstairs","First it was he was going downstairs to look for something.  We live in a one-level condo built on a concrete slab - there IS no downstairs.  I finally figured out he was thinking he was still in his other house he had before we got married.  After a few days, I think I had him convinced that there was no downstairs here.

Then a couple days ago, I asked him to put something on the bed.  ""Which bed?  The bed upstairs?"" he asked.  (We only have one bed.)  Once again, we live in a single-story flat, no basement or cellar, no upper story.  I told him we have no upstairs.  He seemed stubbornly surprised.  ""I think you're confusing this place with that other house again,"" I said.  He agreed he probably was.

But then he has referred to upstairs another time.  Now I'm just rolling my eyes and going with it.  ""Yes, the upstairs bedroom.""  He can wander around looking for nonexistent stairs, it gives him something to do.  

And on the subject of something to do - he has been unable to get the telephone, the automated cat feeder, the lift recliner, and the dishwasher to work (they were not broken) so he took them apart.  Which, you know, sure didn't make them work any better, since he can't put them together again.  So now I have decided his habit of taking clean clothes out of the closet or dresser and putting them in the living room is small potatoes - makes more work for me, but at least it doesn't break anything.

I feel like I have descended into the pit of madness with him.  Why fight it.  Trying to see the funny side.","I hope you were able to get everything put back together. I guess you will need to try and hide the tools . Its amazing what they remember that can get them into trouble. You really do need eyes in the back of your head. Try to stay sane. I like your attitude . Good luck.
I get you!  Yep, sounds like time to lock the tools up / hide them...  I had to lock up our heavy gardening tools, were all sorts of disasters starting to happen, it was frightening.  

 For the past year and a half, every night without fail, my mum starts asking where the dog is - where's the dog but where's the dog... We haven't had a dog in 30 years.  Trying to convince her that doggy passed away 30 yrs ago, it's futile, she'll argue till the cows come home no it's not 30 yrs ago, it's recently.   So now I tell her 'the dog is staying with lookthepenguins brother for a holiday', somehow that makes better sense for her, she's happy with that.
I feel for you.  I find the best way is to not deny, but distract.  'No not the upstairs bed, the one ...(add instructions)'.

You can 'fix' the appliance later,  now I need you to  'peel potates/fold the towels/watch the news'

and such.  it's not easy...
You have to find the humor where you can!

Alzheimers,"Let me be the first in 2022 to say ""fuck you, Alzheimer's Disease""","Had my (36M) parents (60M, 63F) over for dinner tonight and the night ended promptly after the meal finished and my Mom started talking about trying to kill my Dad and blaming my wife (34F) for hitting on my Dad during dinner.  This fucking sucks.  Over the past couple months, I've come to realize that I don't really have a Mom anymore and my kids don't have their ""Nana"" anymore -- she's just a patient now.  She still mostly knows who we are, but she doesn't seem to remember anymore who she is to us, and she's been going through these real nasty waves of just being downright miserable to my Dad.

The day after Christmas my mom introduced me to somebody as her granddaughter, and my daughter as her great-granddaughter. She didn't say my name, just ""this is my granddaughter."" I spent the next hour trying not to cry. Then when I got home I just went in my study and let myself cry. It just fucking sucks.
I'm so sorry. That's awful and so upsetting and frustrating. I'm in the same situation with my dad but he seems to be fading softly (a blessing). Alzheimer's sucks and no one gets it until someone they love goes through it. I have friends whose parents have died suddenly and they act as though I should be grateful for the time (it is not quality time and it's awful watching someone slowly decline). Early onset is awful too because you feel robbed of time. Someone on this subreddit told me that the hardest thing in life is learning to let go, I've found that advice to be invaluable. Whenever I get upset or cross, I try to let go of the negative feelings just as I'm slowly learning to let go of Dad. It's not easy and some days it seems impossible but it's making it a bit easier. Hugs to you x
Sorry, that is way too early for that crap...my mom started it at around age 71, so this year is going to be year 16 with this this awful disease and probably the last and she is bedridden now for over a year. The last 5 years (stage 7) have been dreadful too.
Hold the line. Be as patient as you can but also be as kind to yourself as you can.
It really is a shitty disease. I go through similar scenarios with my spouse . Try to remember it is the disease and not the person. I saw a post suggesting reading the book “ the 36 hour day “. You might find it helpful . I mean it hasn’t stopped his behavior,but it helped my understanding.  I am sorry you have to go through this. It’s  really crazy and very stressful . Now that I have given this a little thought, I have a question for you to consider. You stated you were having dinner. From my understanding AD patients can get worse in the evening (sundowning ). does this happen with your Mom? Maybe if you want to visit your parents you could do so earlier in the day, when she might be in a better mood. My spouse seems to be worse when he is tired or just woke up.  There is no pattern it just comes and goes. Its so hard to see the person you love , become someone you don’t recognize and you can’t have a rational conversation with. And its very hurtful when they accuse you of things you haven’t done. At least there are good times in between . I hope you are able to have a lot of the good times . Wishing you the best for you and your father.
IMO, never be sorry for the rants. They're essential! I just lost my mom after her 13-year battle with Alzheimer's. I expected to be okay with her final passing given how long it had been since she knew who I was, but it does suck. And I wholeheartedly agree with your FU ALZ sentiment.
P.S. TO MY EARLIER POST

I AGREE

FUCK YOU ALZHEIMERS
Hang in there. There will be more to come, but you will find the strength.
I have the same with my mum. She’s so mean. I figure it’s just not her any more. I try the approach now where I try to understand that to her it feels very real so I don’t argue, I empathise and let her talk. See how I can assist her. I mean it doesn’t often work well. But it’s a different thing to constantly disagreeing with her and upsetting everyone. Impossible situation really.
Gosh. My parents are the same age, it’s been hard enough going through my 90 year old grandmother lose her mind and body, after she was already 80. I can’t imagine my mom losing her mind and walking around looking healthy but saying those things. She’s got another high quality 10, 15 hopefully 20+ years ahead of her, I’m mad she is getting years of life stolen by her elderly mom, but I cannot imagine losing her so young.

40% of Alzheimer’s patient family caregivers DIE BEFORE THE PATIENT, of stress-related disease. Please, start looking for an exit ramp for your dad. It may include getting divorced if necessary so she can go to a nursing home without bankrupting them. It’s very sad but his partner is not there anymore, and he doesn’t deserve constant stress, and you deserve many more years with a healthy dad
I’m assuming that your dad has her primary care and a memory care specialist. Ask your dad about getting an anti-psychotic medication in the mix. Seroquel (Quetiapine) worked well with my mom before I had to place her, and it can also help with sleep.

Edit: there’s a car of medication that might help with her outbursts.
Yeah and the fucking horse it rode in on.
Absolutely the worse disease it had been my experience to deal with. Sorry ,I feel your pain.
Waaa, so sorry, it's very sad.   Guess mom might need to go residential soon, must be dreadful stress on yr dad.   Yep, it sure sucks.   \* hugs \*
I feel you. This fucking sucks. Fuck Alzheimer's.
All the best and sorry you have to go through this.
I'm so sorry. I hate how much I can relate. This was the first Christmas where I felt like the parent, especially when I was essentially calming down a toddler throwing a tantrum. I miss my real mom.
This is so hard. My father, I think (I'm not a physician or clinician) has done the following in the last 2 years.

1. Run several red lights (I was present for 3) while he insisted it was okay because he was driving the car. After 2 incidents, I was hoping it was a combination of his lack of hearing, and his refusal to wear hearing aids.

2. Also while driving: Often he dodges or swerved sharply for no real reason. I might utter under my breath ""c'mon dad"". I said something once, asking what he was avoiding. ""That other car!"" he said. I stopped riding in any vehicle he was driving.

3. He forgets who I am.

4. He has entombed himself inside his home now, but no one will visit him. His behavior is like OCD. He sweeps his living room 4 times a day. No one but him has been in there for 18 months. Same with his pool. The pool man quit because there wasn't much for him to do.

5. His treatment of dogs. Dear gods that's the worst.

6. My brother has Omicron. My dad visited him unnanounced, knocked on my brother's door, and shoved McDonald's into my brother's surprised arms.

7. I live 23 hours away by drive and 4 to 5 hours by flight so I hear alot of this after the fact, from my brother.

He insists he is ok.

I can't do anything from here (portland).

Should I ask for help, or is it possible it's a combination of poor hearing, eyesight, depression after my mom's death, and mild OCD?

I don't want to take his phone calls anymore. I want to change my phone #. He will call constantly when he reads the instructions I left for him on how to use the phone.

I don't know what to do. At all.

Alzheimers,Magnesium Glycenate helpful for Alzheimer’s,"Magnesium Glycenate is suggested to be good for sleep quality. We have been trying the supplement before bed with my mom, who has advanced Alzheimer’s. She typically will keep her eyes closed on the morning. Since starting the supplement she opens her eyes in the morning and seems more alert in general.","As with any new supplement/vitamin check with your loved ones doctor first.
Hi.  I just joined.  I take magnesium oxide at night.  Have Alzheimer's family history.  Where is glycenate available?
I'd like to try it. Thx.
Good to hear you're having results.  I sometimes give melatonin tablets an hour before bedtime, as my mother sometimes gets a case of insomnia and can't get to sleep.    


I've also just read that Magnesium L-threonate may help with memory loss also, though I haven't been able to try it with my mother.",2021-12-31 14:52:24,william_o,rt1t0e
Alzheimers,"He's always been verbally abusive to my mother, but his early onset Alzheimer's has amplified all of his worst qualities","He's become unbearable to live with. 

My mother's left literally shaking and crying from being yelled at on a daily basis.

But we can't kick him out. He would never leave. We can't afford to leave. Don't have any money in savings. I can't pull them at home, can't afford it. Even if we could they would kick him out for being too abusive to the staff.

It's heartbreaking to see so many posts on here talking about how they're losing a loved one. Where as I'm just stuck with this fucking asshole I can't get rid of. Some kind of unbearable burden.

I'm at a point where I'm expecting it's going to get bad enough that we'll have to call the cops on him. If we're lucky, the cops will take him down or take him away.

Update: his temper got so bad today that I actually called the cops on him. And while I was waiting for the cops, his defibrillator went off. So called an ambulance. 

Now he's in a hospital and I don't know what to do next.","Hey there, I think you'd benefit from the Alzheimer's Help Line. It's free and the counselors they have are super skilled at these situations and can help you create a road map for your next best option or plan to care for your mother and also to find what's best for the Person Living with Dementia (not sure if you said father or step-father). The number is 1-800-272-3900. They're 24/7, too. I've used them \*MANY\* times.
40% of family caregivers for Alzheimer’s patients actually die *before the patient, due to stress-related disorders*.  Sounds exactly like your mom and you.

Is he seeing a doctor? SEROquel has helped a lot with sundowning mood swings and tantrums. It may temper him at least to make him less dangerous
I'm sorry to hear you're going through this.  Something to maybe consider is reaching out to a local AD organization and ask about consultations with local attorneys that may specialize in handling these kinds of affairs.  My Dad has been working with a local attorney to setup wills for him and my Mom, and separate all their finances.  This way if/when the time comes that she needs to relocated to some kind of assisted living setting, government-funded public assistance will largely bare the burden of cost because my Mom will, effectively, have no financial assets.

Also worth considering, I know this man is so very difficult to deal with, but your Mom needs lots of support.  She needs a community around her that can provide her reprieve from her husband.  And everyone really needs to try partitioning this man from this disease.

As a final thought, has this been discussed with his medical team?  A lot of this behavior could maybe be remedied with medication.
Sorry for your struggles, this disease is the worst. Please get good medical help, there are medications that can help. Good luck and God bless.
Are you in the US? If so, why can't he qualify for Medicaid long term care and go into a care facility?  This is the responsible thing for you to do.  He also needs medical care to manage the aggressiveness. And you might also consider how you are communicating with him and whether you could be escalating his anger instead of diffusing it.
It is unfortunately true. My grandpa became even more aggressive too, to the point he would refuse his sedative throwing the glass content at anyone who was home with him. I had been ran after up the stairs many times (he even detached the handrail from the wall in his anger) and once punched me in an eye. But I knew it wasn't really him doing all these nasty things, so I kept my cool and went on.",2021-12-31 00:59:43,kappakingtut2,rsmyx3
Alzheimers,Girlfriend's Mom,"We suspect that her mom(60s) has AD, just now she had been losing short term memory, small things which can be easily remembered, but what's alarming is she forgot that her husband does not sleep with her but sleeps on their new house alone(her husband lived in the new house 3years ago until present). 

Can we please have tips or things to do to slowdown or reverse it? And know what we are dealing with?

Happened around 8pm , im not sure but i think i heard somewhere that AD gets worse during the evening?","Doctor. Take her to a doctor. Only they can tell you what's going on and what the options are.
You should absolutely be consulting a qualified medical professional -- not social media.  If it is Alzheimer's Disease, there is nothing that can be done to reverse it and, in fact, there's very little that may be available to slow it down.  I suppose quick, easy things that can be implemented while you wait to see a doctor is good nutrition, regular exercise and stimulation of the mind.  Think things like green smoothies, walks around the neighborhood, and crossword puzzles or reading.
Your GF should send her mom to the doctor on a pretext, then preface the doctor visit with a letter or email detailing several recent events and asking them to do a dementia assessment.  Phone to be sure this was received and understood.

There are other conditions which can mimic dementia but are more curable.  You can't cure Alzheimer's, but you can forestall it a while with medications.  Yes, it can get worse in the evening.  There are management tips and tools but first you need a medical opinion that this even is Alzheimer's and not something else.
My dad had a bladder problem and became delusional very suddenly, and I had to force him to go see a doctor to figure it out. Infections and other things can have that effect on older people, so take her to see someone ASAP.
Another thing she has a thyroid problem, i have read somewhere that thyroid may have the same symptoms as AD, just now she ate again and claims she havent ate her dinner. Need help, she forgot like years of her life in 1 night??

Alzheimers,Finding a doctor,"Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking for a while on this sub while procrastinating forcing my mom to go to a doctor for what I believe is Alzheimer’s or dementia. Each time I bring up going to the doctor, she becomes extremely defensive but that is a story for another day. I’m posting because I’m at a loss for how to search for a doctor that can evaluate her. I took her to PCP and he wasn’t very helpful in recommending a doctor for this.

Does anyone know if there is a resource online, or better, recommend someone? We live in NJ. Thanks!","We looked up geriatric doctors and found a good one. You could just tell her that her old one can't fit her in and you find a nice new doctor she'll like better. If your insurance let's you go to a neurologist directly then try that. You can also contact the local Alzheimer's association and see who they recommend.

Since she is hesitant don't tell her it's anything special. It's just a doc.
My mother was also very defensive in the beginning. It might help if you just tell her that it doesn’t hurt to get it checked it out, and if it’s nothing it’s nothing. I looked up Alzheimer’s centers in the area and was able to get her a referral to a local hospital, but she will need to get it from her PCP. It was harder because at the time my mom was 56 so the PCP didn’t quite take it seriously. I wish I’d pushed on my mom a bit more in the early stages instead of letting her live in denial. Good luck!!
Someone else on this sub had a really good idea the other day. Once you book an appointment with a neurologist or geriatrician or internist tell her they’re going to do a checkup and recommend some vitamins and supplements. Perfectly harmless sounding. Then once she’s there they can do a mental test and order a CT scan to check for degeneration in the brain. Good luck!
Look for ""geriatric medicine"" or ""memory care clinic"" in your area or provider directory.  Sometimes people see a neurologist instead.

Keep a log of her most concerning weird symptoms.  Email that to the doc ahead of time, let them know in advance to assess for dementia.
Sometimes health insurance companies have a doctor search on their websites. Maybe her does? I think for mine you could do something like do a search for neurologist accepting new patients within whatever radius of a zip code. If you're super lucky maybe can search for given specialty like geriatric or something. When you got a handful of options can narrow it down by googling them or something. 

Asking your local alz assoc like another commenter said is a good idea too.
you can opt for [Doctor home visit services](https://janavaidya.com/) in your city, which can be helpful to you. wishing speedy recovery to your mom.
I apologize if you said, but how old is your Mom? If she has Medicare part of the standard yearly physical is the administration of a MME (mini mental exam). If you’re not going with to her medical appointments it’s time to start. Knowing her best you’ll know how to present it to her the best way. Our Mom was a bit hesitant but my sister and I were kind but firm in stating that we had always agreed we would help her and Dad in their later years and becoming a partner with her in her health care was part of that. But to the MME.  If the results meet certain criteria her PCP should take the initiative in referring her to the best specialist. This is not an area you have to figure how to proceed.  Calmness, kindness, firmness will get you there.
Please know my suggestions aren’t theoretical. We managed moms vascular dementia for 10 years and dads Parkinson’s related dementia for 5 years before their passing at 90 and 92.  I continue to be the caregiver for my husband age 77who is mid level AZD.",2021-12-29 20:22:22,tarap312,rrolqv
Alzheimers,Emergency Contact Solution?,"Hello Reddit,

My grandfather (75) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a few years ago. As with this awful disease, he has been slowly declining since then and we have now run into a problem that my family and I are struggling to solve.   


My grandfather lives with my grandmother (73). This past year has been harder than most with his decline. My grandmother has begun to worry about what would happen if something serious happened with her and my grandfather needed to contact either a family member or emergency services. The issue we run into is that my grandfather has a difficult time using a phone. He cannot dial 911, search contacts (or find contacts), or remember to use Bixby voice (he has an android phone). As a family we do work with him on these things, but unfortunately it is really hard for him. He can get frustrated/flustered very easily. Here are certain things we have tried/thought of: 

* Adding an emergency contact number to his lock screen on his phone, all he has to do is hit a ""phone"" icon and it will dial directly from the screen to the emergency contact listed. Unfortunately my grandfather didn't understand how to press the ""phone"" icon. 
* Setting up Bixby voice. All he needed to do was say ""Hello, Bixby"" and then ""Call (whomever)"". He really struggles to remember the name ""Bixby"".
* Getting him a life alert. We haven't done this yet because he is unsure he will remember that he has it in a high-stress situation, even if it was on his person at all times. 

We are concerned that if a situation did arise involving my grandmother and she WAS NOT able to call for help herself, that my grandfather would be too flustered to remember some of the things we have been working on. Does anyone have some advice or possibly a solution they have found themselves?","I’m close to the same situation with my husband.  I’m not sure I have a foolproof solution but this might start you thinking.  First, an Apple Watch or similar for your grandmother where a fall would automatically call 911.  I’m sure there are other options besides an Apple Watch (wearable alert buttons rely on the person falling to push the button).  Also, I’m not sure if this would help but some kind of panic button at home that calls a family member could also help.  This might necessitate a few pieces of technology but more than that, it would necessitate you’d grandfather remembering what and where.  My husband does not do well thinking under pressure/stress so I’m not convinced that it is a viable solution.  I wish you well in finding a solution.  Oh, also consider surfing both AARP and/Alzheimer’s websites for other options.  Thinking of you and your family.
Similar situation with my parents. We don't have a good plan yet, but here's what we're looking at:

\- Daily phone calls/ texts from family members

\- My dad (the caregiver) always, always, always has his phone with him. This isn't great, as of course he could fall in the shower and not be able to reach it on the sink, or have something happen and still not be able to dial 911 - but it's all he'll agree to at this point. 

\- A smart lock (Schlage) that allows family members to get in with a code, or share their code as necessary with first responders. 

\- My mom (mid-stage alzheimers) struggles with her phone, but we do keep a list of family members in her ""recent calls"" list, which is the only way she can figure out how to call people. She won't understand how to call 911, but our hope is that she'll call one of us if something goes totally wrong. 

Realistically, my mom would immediately lose a life alert button or press it constantly.  I'd very much like to get one for my father though - just need him to agree to it!  

Looking forward to other suggestions!
Hi friend, I know this can be a hard truth to face, and I’m sure you and your family want to respect your grandparents independence, but I think it’s probably time that they have in-home care, or they move to assisted living where there can be someone else there 24-7 to make sure they are both ok. The problem with them continuing to live alone and trying to rely on a system or tool is that he sounds like he’s beyond being able to use anything reliably, no matter how good of a tool it is. Best to make the transition now before there’s a dangerous situation that ends badly. The disease only gets worse and if he can’t use his phone at all and won’t even remember a life alert he’s wearing… anything would just be an unreliable bandaid. If gramma is also concerned maybe she will accept that the solution is just to not live alone.
Don't count on him being able to press a button in an emergency or to even recognize an emergency even if his wife is laying on the floor. These devices have poor success rates when used with people with dementia. The life alert or similar device needs to be on your grandmother so she can press the button or they can automatically be alerted if a fall is detected. Nothing is fool proof. In addition, setting up a regular AM & PM check-in phone call is a good idea. If there's no response, a family will go right over to check on them. And it sounds like grandfather should never be left alone.",2021-12-29 18:49:29,GerttheCat1113,rrmjyz
Alzheimers,Rapid deterioration- what’s happening?,"Hi Everyone, 
Thanks so much in advance for anyone has the time to comment. Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in May. He had an MRI which showed a moderate level of shrinkage, mild micro vascular ischaemic as well as two small haemorrhages. With COVID, I didn't see Dad until November and noticed a change but it wasn't major. Fast forward to December and he seems to be declining really rapidly. The doctors said that his Alzheimer's could be moderate- advanced based on the fact that he would have been extremely high-performing to begin with. I really don't understand what's happening. Last week, he was able to have solid conversations; this week, he can't seem to sustain a thought. He still has a very impressive vocabulary but it just seems to be going down hill quite quickly. Had anyone seen this? What's happening? x","First thing to check for is an UTI which oddly seems to affect Alzheimer's  patients.
UTI is a good call.  It’s surprising how impactful those can be to cognitive states.  This can be cleared up and a “slower” progression would return. 

The other thing to check for is TIAs or “mini-strokes”. My mother had those during her progression. It was a slow progression for 18 months and the. A steep drop overnight and then slow for another 12. And so on. 

Good luck.
My grampa caught covid and suddenly and quickly got really bad, really fast. Even if he's not showing symptoms, get him checked.
I don't know if this is relevant, but my mother is always worse in winter, perhaps the lack of natural light? Either way, it is consistent for these last 5 years. Roll on spring.
My dad had an issue similar to this. It turned out he had a kidney stone and couldn’t communicate that he was in extreme pain. I feel like his case was rare, but it might be worth it to get him checked out.
You might want to check for dehydration as well . My spouse is worse when this happens .
Thanks so much everyone! All of this advice is so helpful! It's been a tough time and I love how this community rallies around so we can figure things out and move forward. Wishing everyone all the best and their loved ones. Happy New Year x
Thank you so much! This is all brilliant advice ☺️ I'll chase up everything! Xx
Every case is different. My mom started showing signs of dementia way back in 2006 with erratic or illogical episodes that almost seemed like a bad drug trip. 10 years later in late 2016 she lost most cognitive ability. This disease has ""drop offs"" where behaviors will stay consistent for awhile and then suddenly one day to he next a major shift begins. The typical classic signs started around 2012, but the worst shift happened in 2018 and again in 2019 where she basically turned into a zombie walking in circles around the house arguing with invisible people (hallucinations), working herself into a frenzy with nonstop anger fits essentially grabbing anything like chairs, lamps, electronics, home decor, etc. that she was next to and knock or throw it to the floor. Her medicine was hit or miss. The worst were the 3am episodes no one saw but were ""discovered"" when we woke up in the morning. She lost the ability to walk and stand 14 months ago and as of today at 87 years old she lays almost completely motionless in bed, eyes always closed, only mumbles in her childhood foreign language. I'm her only son and she forgot who I was about three years ago. It's a full-time caregiving assignment everyday ""until the end"" since we chose not to place her into a nursing home.
Sometimes they can have a UTI causing rapid decline - which is partially reversible once treated.  Get him in to see his GP, sit in on the session, explain your concerns.
A similar scenario happened to my parent. The doctor told us that what you sometimes see with high-functioning people is that they can compensate for symptoms for a long time. However, when symptoms are too overwhelming, and they can no longer compensate, you'll see onset of a cascade of symptoms. <3
Hi Guys, sorry I know this is a zombie thread now but it was the blood pressure medication. Apparently it reduces blood flow to the brain. Now that he's off it he's actually doing MUCH better! ❤️ Hope it can be helpful to people in the future ❤️",2021-12-29 15:43:34,Desperate_Culture_25,rri6zg
Alzheimers,Early onset or mid or late Alzheimer's?,"Hi guys,

My father (66) has been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, he hasn't forgotten much so to say, can talk perfectly fine, although sometimes gets hiccups in what words to choose. When he forgets something, usually an event in the past decade, I gently remind him of something related to it and he remembers the event completely and can describe specific details, anyways I've been reading up a lot about it, what caught me was that early onset Alzheimer's has a rapid progression compared to late stage. However as I was reading it says people with early onset are usually under the age of 65, sometimes in their 40s, and 50s. Does this mean first symptoms? Or does this mean like if you were diagnosed at 66, it means it's been affecting them way before hand and therefore is considered early onset? 

Thanks in advance for the info guys, really appreciate it and want to get my head around this and what to expect, I know it's not going to get easier.","It's different for everyone.  What I highly suggest is videotaping everything you can - ask him stories, memories, family stories. Remember him now...and I hope you have a long time, but this disease sucks.  My FIL will be 89 in March and now we realize he was showing signs in 2018 - 3 years before he was unstoppable. He is in assisted living, but he is regressing (starting to show signs of paranoia and more confusion despite medication and we don't know how much longer he will be in this stage - 5 years, 5 months? Who knows. But start now with saving memories.

 I wish you all the best, but this community stands with you. Some days will be hard, come and see us, we get it.  It truly is ""the long goodbye""
It's different for everyone but generally early onset means that they are significantly impaired before 65. If your dad is 66 and is still capable of holding conversations and recall events with clarity, then it most likely is not early-onset. But the neurologist would be the best one to clarify for you what type of dementia you are likely looking at. 

For instance, my grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and it was rapid, but it was alcoholism-induced which changes the prognosis.
As others have already mentioned, everyone's experience with the progression of Alzheimer's is slightly different. All I can do is give my own account of my experience with my mother's Alzheimer's.

My mum was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2016 at age 57 but we think that really, the signs were there and she possibly could have been diagnosed a year or two earlier. She'd previously been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment a few years earlier than that and was told that it might just be part of the menopause or it might turn out to develop into something more.

The first couple of years after diagnosis weren't too bad, considering. She moved out of her house and in with her sister and she stopped driving, but she was still herself. She repeated questions and lost the spark of initiative for conversation but she could still understand everything. She didn't cook but could prepare food for herself that didn't require being cooked (sandwiches, fruit, toast, cereal etc).

Then last year happened and the Alzheimer's worsened pretty quickly. Over the space of few months she lost the ability to prepare breakfast for herself (even just making toast or pouring cereal) or even to retrieve a pre-made lunch box from the fridge. She lost the ability to dress herself and then in March of this year, grew terrified of her sister and stopped recognising her for who she was. This fear meant that she couldn't even stand to see a picture of her sister or to know that she was in the same house, so my auntie had to hide in her bedroom and sneak out to be able to go to work. During this time, my husband and I moved in with them, so we were able to help with everything.

This fear lasted a month and during this month, she began to experience states of delirium and became highly stressed and no longer recognised where she was, and didn't feel safe. I suspect that there were moments where she didn't recognise who I was, either, but at least she let me help her most of the time.

She moved into a care home in April and now doesn't know who anyone is. At least her fear of her sister is gone though. She's not non-verbal but doesn't really talk a lot and when she does start to say something, it doesn't make sense and the sentence seems to shift and morph as she's saying it, so you can never be sure what she's talking about.

She's 64 now and it's killing me, to see what she's become. I miss my mum so much and I'm so angry at this illness for taking her from me and leaving this shell of a person behind. There are so many things that I'm never going to get the chance to do with her.

I know this sounds awful but I hope the next stage is quick. 

Anyway, this is just my own experience with the trajectory of the illness, others may have a totally different progression.
I’d say from my time on this sub that literally every experience is different.
My dad started probably like your dad 10-15 years ago and that was early onset. He’s now 64 and much worse in that he can’t recall anything recent and can’t flllow a conversation but still only really mid/late stage despite it being a long time and early onset.",2021-12-29 02:01:27,Dvgamble,rr1wy3
Alzheimers,Getting Married. Need Advice Please.,"My future FIL is in the pretty late stages of Alzheimer's. It is important for my SO to have his father at our wedding, so we are trying to finally get married in a few months. We had plans in 2020, but then COVID as we all know. 2021 involved a lot of moving and job changes.

We are planning an intimate ceremony and reception of only 22 people, just siblings and parents and my best friend and her husband. 


For the ceremony, I am planning on soft, classical music and I also plan on speaking to siblings with young kids to have a caretaker on the day of wedding as I am trying to maintain a quiet environment for FIL. 

I don't really care much about music or dancing, a quiet dinner with maybe the first dance with my dad and then husband would be enough for me. I also want cupcakes or mini pies, so there won't be any cake cutting ceremony. 

I just want some advice on if my ideas I have so far are solid, and asking for any additional advice or ideas that may help the day be as comfortable as possible for FIL. I figured if the younger people wanted to continue the celebration later on, we could all do so at the hotel bar. (Our parents and siblings live all over the US, so there will be a fair amount of traveling. We will also be traveling to future stepMIL and FIL for the wedding so stepMIL doesn't have to deal with the stress of traveling with FIL.)

I don't want my SO's stepmom to feel left out of the fun of the wedding, but I also don't want to agitate FIL. Please help.","My dad is in the late stages and has been for a while. We also did a small wedding (ours was backyard) and I had my mom walk me down the aisle. We still did family pics but because it was at our home dad was able to go back and chill after the ceremony and we carried on with the reception. Since he was cool sitting in a recliner watching TV  in a bedroom we carried on as usual. 

My brother sat with my dad and helped him to his seat at the wedding. Our ceremony was also short so there wasn't any long boring bits. We did a cake and he really loved it. And we did buffet taco bar which is his fav food too. We just let him eat in the recliner while he watched his fav westerns.

Just have a nice chill spot for you FIL to go and have several people that can switch out hanging with him that way all can enjoy the party.
I think those all sound like good steps but I would have a backup plan for him if things are too overwhelming. Is there a space you could take him if he gets over stimulated and needs a place to calm down? I am just thinking of that because In general my mom needs a routine now - if she doesn’t have that she isn’t able to remain calm and things will agitate her to the point of yelling or general disruption.
We had this with my father this spring, he is mid-stages though. One thing that was really nice is that we played music that both we and my father likes. Soft jazz, and in the church we had ""two sleepy people"" on violin. He was teary eyed and happy! Music can be a very strong thing even in late stages of alzheimers and is a good way of creating the correct ""wibe"".
Any advice I would offer has already been said by these other wise folks. I did just want to say though that it is really wonderful that you are so thoughtful about all of this. It's refreshing to see people who are supportive of the needs of all folks, even on your special day! Congratulations on your marriage!
Although my dad was mid stages when we got married, this sounds a lot like our wedding.  

24 people total, sitting at 4 tables in a local pub. We did preordered meals so no menus. I asked for no music whilst we were eating, my dad has hearing issues. Although we had a cake the hotel cut it for us after everyone had seen it. We invited a friend of my parents who could take my dad home when needed so my mum got time with her family.
first of all - congrats! 
If I were in your shoes, I'd try to find a few people with whom he is most comfortable and then assign shifts to look after him and do the things he engages with (in my father's case, walks, looking at old pictures, a drive with music he likes, sneaking him away for a snack he likes, etc). Lastly, I'd expect that he would become agitated and warn others to validate that there 'is a lot of chaos' and he's handling it well. Good luck friend, and kudos on your planning
When my best friend got married, her family brought her grandpa to the ceremony but then had a caregiver take him him and stay with him the remainder of the night. He got to see the ceremony and do the pictures but it was a good amount for him and the rest of the family could still partake.
Its good you're having it near to him.. The more travelling for him is involved the worse he might be, especially if he gets agitated when theres a change in his routine. For some people with Alzheimer's i would not be surprised if they became insistent on going home at some random early time. Even sitting in a side quiet place might not remedy this. If you can have a side quiet place id probably try to see if i can get an especially comfy chair for him to sink in to and relax.

Id have on hand for him foods or snacks thats hes familiar with, so maybe he can snack and calm down if agitated. Id also have a portable music player (with songs he liked from his teens to his 30s) for him to listen to with headphones on. Music can sometimes change an agitated Alzheimer's persons mood around. If you want to try, maybe even play some of those songs at the venue and you could luck out and have a nice dance with him. Or some cheerful sorta singingish noises, depending how far gone he is. 

If you can have someone dedicated to keeping an eye on him (maybe a volunteer, or friend who doesnt mind) i bet that would be good too. Someone besides (or in addition to) stepMIL, so that she can relax. I can easily imagine a primary caregiver NOT be able to enjoy themselves at this event. This person can just keep an eye on them, tail them if they wander off, maybe go for a short walk with them if they ""have to go"" to some unspecified place, then guide them back to the venue once they got their wiggles out. You could maybe find such a volunteer through your local Alzheimer's association or church group or something. But maybe your stepMIL can think of someone who would be good (and that volunteer maybe gets a free meal out of it?).. Maybe that person could give them a ride to and from too.. That could be supernice for stepMIL/primary caregiver. So she can max out her fun time. 

Id also ask stepMIL/primary carer what other things could be handy. Depending on how the rest of FILs body is doing, maybe shed like a place to stash a change of clothes? Some no water bath wipes? Maybe diaper or two? Towels? 

Its great when people want to include Alzheimer's folks in their plans.. Don't feel too bad if it gets a little hairy tho. Its great to even try. 

Good luck and congrats!",2021-12-28 17:17:28,lklaf,rqraay
Alzheimers,Early symptoms?,"Hi!  1st reddit post here,  please be kind.  My husband's grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimers at approx 75 y/o. We had noticed during the most recent visit that he was repeating questions, but in a conversational sort of way. The last 2 times my 65 y/o MIL has visited,  we've noticed her repeating questions in a rapid-fire way, where we can't even finish our sentences.  It doesn't seem forgetful so much as really overbearing.  However, so also was struggling with children's games (understanding the skip symbol in Uno, the wild 2 in Dos, drawing a new card after every turn in the kids version of Cards Against Humanity). She's much younger than her dad was,  and didn't seem to be having any issues functioning. 
Could this be the beginning?  Should we be concerned?  Any tips for starting a conversation?  I don't think she'll hear it very well.

Thanks","With my LO, there were other signs of her short term memory loss. She’d lose her list on the way to the grocery store, or IN the grocery store, or buy the same groceries twice in one week (without having possibly been able to get through a 5lb bag of flour) and she would lose her car in the parking lot of the grocery store. We suggested she see a neurologist to get some suggestions on vitamins that could help that’s how we got the diagnosis.
maybe have your spouse call her doctor with your concerns . If she hasn’t had a physical in a while maybe you two could take her in and her doctor could give her a short mental test . There are lots of reasons for mental decline and some can be reversed . This  way you dont have to bring it up until the doc says something . People like to hide their decline.",2021-12-28 13:44:32,Foreign-Low1066,rqmlgc
Alzheimers,Have old photos? I can help restore them!,"I realized one of the very few gifts that my grandma appreciates immensely  was a photo of her dad. Why was it special? The original photo was extremely tattered and ruined with scratches and a few rips. I’m a designer and photo retouching/restoration is something I really enjoy. I surprised her with the photo cleaned up and she cried. Since it was digitally I made her a few copies so she could have it in different places too. 

I wanted to open my services to everyone here in this community! If you have an image that you’d like to be restored please DM and I can give you a timeframe when I can get the image done. Typically getting an image restored can cost $100s but I’m offering it freely since I saw how much joy it brought my grandma.

I am able to: remove scratches/rips, burns, potentially enhance some of the colors, and provide you with a jpeg of that image after being restored. Timelines will vary pending on the image and I’ll confirm that I’ll be able to bring the photo back to life. If you have any questions feel free to DM me directly!","Awww...that is so very sweet!
Bit off topic, but I have a bunch of negative slides that I want to digitise for my dad full of pictures in his youth, I was wondering if you knew how to do that and perhaps give me a step by step or info, or if you give me some pointers to save money in digitising negatives if it's too difficult for someone with minimal camera experience to do it themselves.

Thank you very much, appreciate what you're doing greatly",2021-12-28 12:18:08,kiwi1325,rqkoyn
Alzheimers,When it’s time?,"When is the right time to have someone with dementia living with someone? My grandmother lives alone, everyday one of us visits her. We buy groceries, meds, take her to the doctor, etc. but for most of the time she is alone. She does the laundry by herself, she prepares her food and pretty much can take care of herself. She communicates okay, only she sometimes repeats herself. One time she went a bit far from home and she felt lost. The police called us and we picked her up from the station. Right now she doesn’t go out on her behalf but I wonder when will it be when she will need a person with her all the time before it’s too late (before she hurts herself or she gets lost).","My thinking is it can never be too early, because tomorrow may be too late. 
Get her into assisted living or memory care while she still has some cognitive function so that the move doesn’t have to happen “too late”. Too late makes that transition much more difficult.
Been living with grandma for three years, ever since the first signs started.
It’s never going to be “the right time”, but if you wait for her to ask, it will never happen. I moved in with my grandmother when I was 14, about a year after she was diagnosed. I’m glad I did it so early, because when she started to really go, we already had habits established.

Sometimes they change overnight. Maybe just one small thing. My gramma went from an independent lady to being terrified of leaving the house or being alone in case she got lost. I cherish the years I was able to take care of her.
What does she think about these options?  Take her wishes into account 

Some assisted living places allow pets.
My mother's neighbor told me they saw her sitting on her front porch at 3am.  My mother, of course, denied it.  So, I put contact sensors on all her exterior doors and it turned out she was getting up at all hours of the night and going outside to see if her ride was there (I had someone picking her up every morning).  That was when I had to get someone to stay with her.  But, after calculating out the cost of 24hr home care, memory care was equivalent so after 6 months or so, I went with memory care.
How far away do you live? If her house has steps, tight hallways, cannot get downtown or to any shops or park without driving etc. you should move her sooner rather than later. It is NOT a “last resort”. She will need some ability to create new muscle memory in order to walk around the new place safely. And, it is no longer safe for people with dementia to drive looooong before they lose the ability to walk around a familiar area, socialize, hold conversation. Once she relies on someone else driving her just to leave the house at all, the resentment builds up quickly on both sides.
In my opinion, a set-up where you’re living in a duplex or in different apartments in the same building; that can help a lot. Close enough to check in on her multiple times a day, have a baby monitor to hear her yell for help if she falls… but you’re not permanently sharing the same kitchen, living area, tv, bathroom. No for this to be sustainable, you need your own space.

When a condo in my grandmother’s building went for sale, my parents lived one hour away, and decided that buying a condo was a better deal, not just as an investment but literally cheaper, than paying for assisted living while she needed a very low level of help.
Dementia rarely goes with independence, at least as long as the affected person is still able to look after everyday tasks and is well or moderately self aware. But one thing I learned from experience, is that they like having social contacts with people outside the closest circle. My grandpa couldn't recognize my mom (his daughter), but was able to stupefy everyone every summer, speaking fluent French with our French relatives without making any mistake!",2021-12-28 11:53:07,Limp_Offer1580,rqk55p
Alzheimers,Wandering grandma,"Hi, my grandmother has recently started to wander off during the night ( while people she lives with are asleep) and may be while they are gone. Is there some sort of permanent bracelet that can track her or have her information. What childproofing things could help?  ( locks have been changed and she figured those out).  Other things are she hides stuff and calls people at random times.","We used these [toddler door things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BFFVWLS/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_0B7AQE7DXTZVDBY96C6A?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) that helped. 

We also put cheap alarms on the door that sounded when open. Then we put cheap slide locks at the bottom of the door that we could slide open with our toe. My dad never knew to look down.

Get these installed asap. A tracker will still allow her to get out and get hurt before someone woke up and noticed she was gone. Too many things can go wrong if she is by herself.
Do what the other person has sadi in this thread. We also installed alarms/alerts so when the door opened, it rang and chimed loudly to let other people in the house know that a door was opened/had left. 

You don't want her to leave and find her afterward. It's quite dangerous and with winter, she can easily get lost, freeze, or die.
My mom's memory care doctors told us to sign her up for the Alzheimer's Association's Safe Return program that's with MedicAlert.

[https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/safety/medicalert-with-24-7-wandering-support](https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/safety/medicalert-with-24-7-wandering-support)

That said, she kept throwing the bracelet out in the outside trash bin and we didn't find it before the trash came one day, so it was useless. When we went to cancel, they asked us for the bracelet back. We didn't have it, and we were unaware that cancellation would require the return of a bracelet that we'd paid for. It took a fight, but eventually, they processed our cancellation.

We ended up using this as the push to get her into memory care. With us working, her not having any money for home care services until we sold her house, and her location near hundreds of acres of forests, swamps, and rivers, it was safer moving her.
Grandad always called people at random times and went wandering!
I reccomended a medical ID bracelet. You can put your number on there and ask people to phone it if they find her. 
You can also get a Bluetooth tracker and put it on her. Maybe attach it to a necklace or put it in something she always takes with her. 
Hope that helps! 
Of course you can track her phone, but I assume she isn’t always taking that with her
A year ago, we purchased these door locks and put them up high. She's never noticed as she doesn't look up. She can unlock the regular locks, but the door still won't open. They're a lifesaver and I don't have to worry every time I heard her moving around at night or if I was in the bathroom during the day.

For my grandma, we purchased kind of like a smart watch, but for kids, it had few functions, could track by GPS, you could speak to her and she would hear you, it also had a lock system for the watch bracelet that she couldn't take it off herself. You could look into those, they were inexpensive, too.

There are also GPS bracelets for elders that you can track and they have an large SOS button for her to press on it. I don't know what would fit your needs best, this is just my experience.
We got my mom a weenect device as keychain. It has an SOS button as well' it requires a subscription and sip card though",2021-12-27 21:32:54,_roses__,rq4bdq
Alzheimers,Thinking of changing grandmas diet,"After Christmas, grandma will happily munch on the leftover nibbles in small amounts in the fridge all through the day. She’s recently been refusing what she says are meals too large to eat. (A jacket potato for dinner is “so big” she won’t even try to eat any of it).
Today she had 2 pork pies, half a quiche and 3 jam tarts over the afternoon. 
Should I get back to making her meals that are good for her, or continue to buy the ready made nibbles she currently likes?","My vote is processed meals she will eat are better than healthy meals she won't eat. Dementia is a terminal illness, so anything that can make the interim more comfortable is a kindness.
My dad won’t prepare food for himself anymore, but when asked he can always eat “a little bite”.  If I just keep a conveyor belt of small bites coming he will devour it all. Cut up bananas, little finger sandwiches with butter and spreads, small potatoes in gravy, stew with small chunks of hearty meat and veggies, full fat everything. It’s not that he’s not hungry, he often lets himself get to be actually starving, the dementia makes it difficult if not impossible for him to recognize how to approach a normally plated meal as something he can tackle. Also swallowing and the motor skills needed to feed himself are fading, so the easier it is to pick something up and get it into the mouth and down the hatch, the better. 

Small readily available helpings is the way to go imo. It’s also much easier to get through a meal if I don’t give him any choices or warning. Just hey dad here you go eat this and plop it in front of him. 

I learned all this from his in home nurses and other professional caretakers here on Reddit, you guys are actual angels!
My SO lost weight quickly. I took over the food prep and shifted her diet to more carbs, and protein. But I also increased the availability of dessert. I think that I have added 2-3 lbs in the last three months. I switched to whole milk from 1%. Added cheeses and cheese spreads. My approach is any calorie is a good calorie. 

If she eats snacks, keep lots of snacks available. Try to create snack like meals. Every calorie is a good calorie.

At meals, I build a fruit and veggie tray, have while wheat crackers, potato chips, and nuts. The cheese spreads and peanut butter are out too. My SO can eat 200 calories from these add-ons.
I give my wife Ensure which she likes. Her ""milkshake"". Add ice cream for more calories.
My mother slowly stopped eating. She loved McDonald’s burgers and fries and Chick-fil-A nuggets. She ate those, sweet potatoes, and ice cream along with Ensure for vitamins the last few months of her life. Finally sweet potatoes and ice cream. Feed her what she enjoys and will eat. As horrible as it sounds she does have a terminal disease and toward the end they eat less and less. Also usually it’s less confusing to have one thing at a time.
We give my dad ensure shakes and call them chocolate milk. He drink them right up with a straw. 

Dad find joy in some foods. We give him Fritos and Snickers because he had always loved them. Eating like trash around the holidays isn't bad. They can drop weight so quickly even while eating full meals.

As long as she likes the food give it to her.
You could pre-prep some healthy meals in small servings that are convenient, along with the other ready-made nibble. But allow her to eat whatever she wants. Food is one of the last few pleasures she has, let her enjoy it guilt free.
Make nibble sized portions of healthy foods if she'll eat them. Leave them around if you can, where she would ordinarily find them when she feels like nibbling.",2021-12-27 12:48:18,Bolehillbilly,rpswh5
Alzheimers,How does a DNR/Living Will work with Alzheimer's Patients?,"My mother has a living will and I don't understand how that works when she stops feeding herself. It says not to give her artificial nourishment if she has a terminal illness. 

I have a friend who said her mom just said ""I'm not eating any more"" and died a week later. 
Has anybody else been in this situation? I'm want to be mentally prepared for it because I'm her medical POA and I have a combative sibling who I will have to be dealing with.","So with ours if dad stops eating we will not put in a feeding tube. We will opt for fluids but that's it. We also will not opt for any life saving measures like no breathing tubes. If his body is ready to go then it's time for  him to go. 

With food dad will mostly feed himself and if he gets to where he had trouble lifting the soon we will feed him. But, if he refuses to eat we won't force him. 

Stuff like that. 

Good for your mom getting that set up early.
I understand its just like the other commenter said. No feeding tube, but if they are willing to eat and are just having motor skill problems eating, id feed them, but not try to force.  You might ask their doc to ask if they can get into hospice care, and explain the situation. Maybe you can get some medication to help ease their pain from going out like this. Doc and hospice might also be able to provide their opinions on whats normally done to help smooth conflict with sibling. Good luck.
When my grandma went into hospice, she just wasn't hungry. She'd eat a bite at most of food, but everything was palliative. Enough care to make her comfortable. No feeding tube or intravenous fluids. She passed around a week after she stopped eating/drinking.
Artificial nourishment would be a feeding tube.

With my grandmother, she didn't have a living will but had talked to me about her wishes before her diagnosis. I was medical POA and decided on palliative (comfort) measures only. DNR, no feeding tubes, no intubation.
If your sibling is ever pushing a feeding tube, there is plenty of research showing that feeding tubes are contraindicated in people with dementia. If there's going to be disagreement among family or family & facility staff, it is sometimes around hand feeding. For instance, dementia is advanced, the person is mostly non-communicative and is totally dependent, and the staff spoons pureed food in her mouth and she naturally swallows. The person is not seeking out food and has zero quality of life but will still swallow food and liquid that is put into their mouth. Everyone has different opinions of this and it's not specifically addressed in a living will. I think we need living wills that specifically cover different scenarios related to dementia so family doesn't have to be the one making the choice: either to prolong a miserable life or to end things quicker.
when people start dying, they stop feeling hungry and wanting food. (part of this could be that food is not enjoyable, as they are choking on it as their throat forgets how to swallow). They are not feeling pain due to hunger. They don’t die because they starve to death. They stop eating because they are dying.",2021-12-27 11:24:48,Missmoneysterling,rpr2sy
Alzheimers,Video game suggestions for patients,"Recently I became aware that my grandpa is having some memory issues. I’m not sure if he’s been diagnosed yet, but he definitely knows that something is wrong most of the time. He has some mobility issues and basically just watches tv all day. I was thinking of things I could get for him to occupy his time, and I remembered that he used to play old NES and Sega games when I was a kid. I am thinking that playing games might stimulate his brain and help him regain some focus.

After some searching online, I found some studies that support this theory. Furthermore, 3D games are potentially more helpful, because they require spatial navigation and result in more learning. I want to get/make some way for him to play games, but it needs to be super accessible for him (both the system and the specific games). Any issues or frustrations getting the system to work will likely cause him to give up on it.

Does anyone have any suggestions for games? I was thinking about certain “walking simulator” games, because they are not action-oriented but still have the player navigating a 3D space while also telling an engaging story.

I don’t know of any game system that exists that would be accessible enough for him, so I would probably have to build something custom. My first thought was a retropie, but I don’t think they would be able to play the more recent 3D titles. Any suggestions here would be appreciated. I really want to do something productive to help him and potentially others. Thanks!","Idk anything about games but it sounds great, good on you!!

Alzheimers,Struggling with my mother,"So my mother is fast losing her short term memory. Nothing has been diagnosed but I think soon it will need it. I don't know if it's Alzheimer's or dementia but I'm finding her company is exhausting constantly repeating things I said a couple minutes ago and her having zero recollection of things we have been doing. The exhaustion I feel is coming from the digging deep for my patience. I am and have always been a person who doesn't talk for the sake of talking so repeating myself is hard. 

I understand how hard/frustrating this may be for her but when myself and my father try to give her strategies to help she refuses to listen and then also of course she forgets.

I guess I'm looking for a vent but I'd love to hear about people's coping mechanisms...this is so hard to deal with and it's really bringing my mental health to a very low level. Any advice, tips would be highly appreciated!","Try and get her a diagnosis as soon as possible. We struggled to get a diagnosis with my mum and I'm so regretful. If the memory clinic tell you it's not dementia, ask for another test and ask exactly why they came to that conclusion. My mum was told after her first test that it wasn't dementia and we were all so relieved. Turns out it was and she missed out on two years of treatment. Tread softly but firmly, you won't regret making her get tested even if it causes arguments (as it did with my family). Look after your own mental health and take breaks from it all whenever you need to without feeling guilty. There is no way you can help her if you are drowning yourself.

If you get a diagnosis it will really help you to be more patient and forgiving, I promise.
My Aunt had a stroke this summer that destroyed her short-term memory. Like, so short that we can have a detailed conversation about the doctors appointment, make said doctors appointment together, watch her write it down in her planner, put it on her phone calendar. She'll ask me what we just did within 2 minutes. Every time. I get how frustrating it is. 

The planner is actually helpful. It did take several hours (over a few weeks) of reinforcing it. Including refusing to have the conversation with her unless she took notes in the planner (that her daughter had to custom design for her) and also saying ""We already talked about this. Check your planner."" But she now checks the planner before she'll ask. You could also try it with a whiteboard, where you can write down the important stuff & just point at it every time she asks. She won't like it, but she'll get used to it. 

Please take her in to get a diagnosis sooner rather than later. Short-term memory loss can be caused by many, many things, some of which can be mitigated and improved. 

The sooner you get the diagnosis, the sooner you'll know if there are avenues for help and relief. My Aunt gets 3 specialists a week (memory OT, PT, and general nurse) who come in and check on her, help her with memory exercises, have given us many helpful tips, etc.
Caregiver support group for dementia caregivers - see if there is one in your area, maybe at the Senior Center or local Alzheimer's organization.

It's a fast way to get up to speed on all aspects of this disease from the family's perspective.
I've just put my Mom into a long term care home after 4+ years of caring for her after her diagnosis with AD. In no particular order because you'll do what you feel able to cope with I'd recommend:

1) Diagnosis and medication - start with family doctor and then proceed to geriatric psychiatrist if necessary. 

2) Paperwork - make sure that wills, power of attorney and advance health care directives are in place. My father waited too long because he was in denial, so his will is current but my mother's was last updated when us kids still needed guardians (Grrr) 

3) Strengthen your own support network (friends, therapist, support group) - some of this may need to be virtual at the moment which is significantly harder, but I found a support group invaluable for the first 3 years or so. I'm still in therapy as caregiving can take a real toll.

4) Get help into the house as soon as you can so she gets used to it. People put this off so long and it makes such a huge difference. You don't necessarily need a professional caregiver at this point, but if she has AD you will at some point. Start by hiring a family friend to do things with her that she finds meaningful. I sold this to my mother as work I needed help with - not her. My Mom wanted to be helpful for a long time, so we always had a bunch of kitchen prep work for her to do. Stay ahead of the help you need if you can afford it, it's completely worth every cent. 

5) Let go of the idea that she's refusing to listen/cooperate as much as possible. She will be mostly invested in preservation of her dignity and it will be frustrating. When you find yourself losing patience, walk away for a bit. Always walk away rather than argue (as much as possible - forgive yourself for being human. No one does this perfectly!)
Dementia like symptoms can also be signs of an UTI infection. Especially, if changes seem rather rapid. Get that checked out. 

I'm a carer and my strategy is to give myself plenty of space.  If she's especially agitated by something, try to get her some busy work that she can still handle or point her towards the TV. 

It is my actual job at the moment as well (I basically get paid - not very much - to live with my grandma expense free), so that helps.",2021-12-25 16:23:19,Successful-Umpire-31,rohrqm

Alzheimers,My mom got lost and pooped herself for the first time,"My mom went out this morning like she does every day. Usually my father is alert but this time he fell asleep. When he woke up my mom wasn't home yet so he checked her location with an app and she was far from home. He called her and explained how to come back. She came back with no issues but she had pooped herself. My theory is that she found every store closed because it's Christmas so she got confused and kept walking.

Anyway this is the first time this happens and it breaks my heart. Fortunately she likes taking her phone everywhere. I think she feels safe with it and my father always checks her location. 

Some extreme measures are coming :(

Merry Christmas everyone!","We had to add key locks from the inside after my mom wondered off too many times with the cops having to be called. It’s not easy to do as they initially think they are trapped in prison. It’s necessary though. Better for her to be safe rather than to wonder off without her phone next time.
Door alarms, maybe.

So sorry.  The wandering is scary.  Do you live in a cold climate?
Awww that's a bummer. That's a hard stage. How was she, was she really upset that happened?
Aww, so sorry, poor mom!   Yes, likely confused by the closed stores.   Very possibly got even more confused with the distress of having to poop.

My mum too, yesterday (Xmas Day) wanted to do her regular 'go up to the shop & get the newspaper' (it's really nearby, just around the corner) - I told her it was Xmas Day & they'd all be closed & anyway no newspaper, but she still really wanted to go, so I went along with it - she took AGES to come back, I was just about to go look for her - she'd then continued on up to the next shops, turns out.

She also pooped herself recently - I think courtesy of a lunch we had out that might have been slightly dodgy - we ordered different items so idk but, she nearly made it to the loo but at the very last minute it all went to hell, poor thing.  Thank goodness at least we were at home.  But I noticed, that pooping her pants, distressed her so much, her mind state immediately took a marked dramatic plummet for 15 mins or so, she was SO confused about everything.  :(

It's really great your mom doesn't go out without her phone!!   Such a comfort for you all.  But yeh, will come the time at some point I suppose, where she'll forget it.   best of luck!",2021-12-25 11:31:30,PuppyDontCare,rocqkl

Basically one of my parents is genetically prone to Alzheimer’s, has had some stressful triggers in their life and has shown a few other symptoms like forgetfulness, spacing out, repeating themselves etc. 

However one thing they tend to do is this really intense, but glassy stare. Growing up I had a bad relationship with them… but have restored it a bit. I want to be warm to them… but they just stare at me so intensely that I feel uncomfortable or even terrified… it’s like their eyes pierce my skin, I’m about to get in trouble, or it’s not my parent… like it’s almost as if I’m viewing a stranger when they give me this look. Their eyes scare me now basically…

Is this common to anyone? Any tips on how to get over it?","Hmmm.. Do they have ptsd also in their past? My dad used to have war time flashbacks mixed in with his Alzheimer's, and my mom said that they way he looked or behaved when i saw him was kind of similar to when he had flashbacks from before i was born, before the Alzheimer's. He got better, but then it came back with the Alzheimer's. 

Anyway.. Just know its probably not about you. But you could try to talk to them about it when they have this look. I would think that learning about what is distressing them while they are still verbal might help you later on.. Esp if they get that same upset look later, after they are non verbal.. You might have a better shot at making them feel better or distracting them later if you can understand what their frame of mind is now. Even if its not ptsd. Any info or description you can get from them now may help you later.",2021-12-25 00:54:56,Silly_Ad_3533,ro3ny5
Alzheimers,Grandfather thinks that there's a robber inside his home,"I grew up with my grandparents and love them very much. Since they live at the countryside I can only visit them when I'm on vacation. My grandfather's Alzheimers and Parkinson have worsened this year. My grandmother takes care of him but it's getting really difficult because he's also getting very snappy. 

Because of his Alzheimers he keeps forgetting where he put his stuff so since beginning of the year he's convinced that there's an imaginary neighbor's kid who's camping inside of his house and waiting for him to let his guard down so he can steal things like his glasses, tv remote and snacks. My grandmother keeps telling him that there's no robber but he won't listen. It's very painful to me because he's mentally not doing well since nobody in our family believes him. 

It has come to the point where he refuses to sleep and live his life. He just sits in a room waiting to catch the robber. Now he wants to install cameras and i don't know how to talk to him or handle the situation because I don't want him to think that he's crazy but also don't want to encourage him. I'm one of the only few people he trusts since I have a lot of patience with him and don't want to ruin that.","It's easier to ""play along"" by installing deadbolts and cameras.   

There are motion detector alarms with cameras. So tell him, he can sleep. If the alarm goes off he can review the footage.

Do let his Neurologist know what is going on.   With PDD (Parkinson's Disease with Dementia), we still have memories but sometimes get confused. Arguing causes resentment, so playing along and asking ""how did they get in here"" is better.

Classic for a burglar came in and trashed the house. My wife freaked out and called our local PD (small town). As they were there to make sure the burglar wasn't still in the house, a Great Dane jumped back in through the ripped-up window screen, grabbed a bottle of maple syrup, and jumped back out. Everyone is looking at each other with a WTF just happened.
I'm a caregiver but I also am convinced that there's a robber in MY house.  He or she has taken my keys, my glasses, my cane, and most of my hats and gloves, more times than I can count.  My magnifying glass?  Gone.  Cell phone?  Who knows.

When my ""old man"" started exhibiting Alzheimer's symptoms, I was advised to get all guns out of the house.  That was maybe 4 years ago.  He said he needed to keep a loaded handgun under the bed ""in case anyone breaks in.""  I gave everything to his son, who agreed with me that maybe loaded guns and crazy old men shouldn't mix.

We go through the finding routine all the time.  Example: where are your glasses?  He had so many old pairs that he could never find the current pair, so I locked all the old ones up.  (Simplify, simplify, simplify.)  So I ask the logical questions:  what room were you in before this?  I check the usual clutter spots.  I recall when I last saw him wearing them.  Finally, I default to ""They'll turn up.  They always do.""  

I guess with regard to your problem, you can try normalizing:  ""Man, that's annoying, isn't it?  I always lose my glasses, too.""  You can try a type of Alzheimer's logic:  ""Yes, there could be a robber, but maybe you just mislaid them.  That has happened before, just yesterday, in fact.""  Or simply offer aid:  ""I'll help you look for them.""  Dementia patients can often be redirected, so instead of debating whether there's a robber head-on, looking at the problem from a different angle might work.

Finally, if they keep insisting there's a robber, you can try accepting their delusion.  ""Thank you for staying up in case the robber causes any problems.  I have to get some sleep.  See you in a few hours.""  As to the cameras - ""Hey, that's a good idea!""  Get some nanny-cams installed that family can use to monitor what he's up to.  Win-win.
My grandma has a similar thing. Someone actually did steal her laundry from a hanger outside (a kid in the neighborhood was in a bad car accident and he's been a little weird ever since), but it was years ago. 

When I moved in with her to take care of her, I did a little cleaning and disposing of old stuff and I took some of her bedding to different places in the house, I'm using some, uncle is using some, etc. Now she keeps repeating that someone stole her bedding from her closet (probably at least twice a day) and I just reassure her that it's safe and that I stored them elsewhere. Didn't even help when I moved most of it back. 

She also kept cash in the closet next to it and we deposited it in her account, so she doesn't spend it or throw it away. So that probably doesn't help, because I think she checks for the money and finds it's gone and it kinda agitates her and she escalates it. She's very happy when I tell her we deposited it, but kinda doesn't believe me at the start. 

I generally try to play along and ignore it as much as possible. I definitively don't try to convince her no one stole it, just that it was long ago and it's safe now. 

If you are going to try to reason with your grandpa, I'd first ask him how does the robber get in? Then you go together and check, if everything is in place (no broken locks, broken windows, etc). Then you check where could the robber hide and search the whole house for hiding places. 

I think installing cameras is probably a decent idea. Maybe get him to agree that you'll keep them for a week or some such. I'd also look for a solution to having his remote chained in one place, get some eyewear retainers, stuff like that. 

Question; let's say he misplaces his glasses and blames the robber. What does he say when he finds the things?
My mother thought the photos on the walls, her reflection in mirrors, and framed photos on the walls were people in the house. We were able to cover or move some things around and keep the rooms bright. That helped. She also took medicine for the hallucinations. Good luck. It usually takes a good bit of trial and error to achieve real improvement.
My mom is afraid that the man who jumped from the neighbors wall, a long time ago, into the patio is going to come back. She doesn't trust us because she says that the last time, we opened the door and let the robber scape free.

I figured she's mixing up a cat with a robber. Many times the neighbor's cat fell into our patio, so we usually let them out by opening the garage door.

The brain is so weird.

I can't offer a solution because I'm also new at this but usually agreeing, reassuring and trying to change the subject works fine.",2021-12-24 10:07:38,Tandy-Thien,rno49x
Alzheimers,Experience with Depakote,"Mom lives in a skilled nursing facility. Over the last few months she has been having behavioral issues (not my term) like going into other residents rooms and taking their things, being verbally abusive, making threats of violence, and on several occasions hitting staff and other residents. They put her on depakote which turned her into a zombie. After 3 weeks she adjusted to the dose and we had a few visits where she was much more present with me, even called me by my name. I could see that she was still agitated, standing up like she was going to go somewhere then laying back down repeatedly. This week her verbal abuse began again and she took a swipe at one nurse. So again the are upping her dose. Does anyone here have experience with this drug? Are there alternatives? For the first time in 10 years I feel like I can’t find a solution to a problem. Thanks","They didn't use depakote with my mom, but for her rage and physical and verbal abuse, they started with antidepressants (sertraline) after she made several comments about wanting to kill herself. As she entered a stage where everything was causing panic attacks, they tried anti-anxiety meds (buspirone and citalopram), but then she got really bad and started attacking people. She tried to smash one woman's head into a brick wall twice, broke her wrist attacking a guy, and sprained a nurse's wrist. At that point, she ended up on antipsychotics ( haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone.) Haldol was the worst as she simply became a zombie and slept pretty much 24/7. Once she was in a wheelchair, her doctor ordered her off everything except for Tylenol because after breaking her wrist (she pulled off three cast when she'd go to bed, so it never healed correctly and caused her a lot of pain) . She passed away about three months after that order.
I'm sorry you and your mother are going through this!

Depakote is not ideal for dementia patients.  It is an old anti-epileptic drug.  It can cause more cognitive changes and parkinsonism in dementia patients.  If given too much it can cause Depakote toxicity which certainly is no good. I'll also mention that there was a 1.5 billion dollar settlement for the inappropriate promotion of using depakote in the elderly.


https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/abbott-labs-pay-15-billion-resolve-criminal-civil-investigations-label-promotion-depakote


Seroquel is usually a well tolerated antipsychotic that doesn't typically cause parkinsonism and does well to control agitation and hallucinations.  Perhaps you could ask about switching to that drug?  Typically started at around 25 mg in the elderly but can go up a decent amount.  Do be sure to avoid Haldol as well.

It could also be possible that the nursing home staff are impatient or poorly trained which of course leads to frustrated patients within the home.
Thank you for your replies. I was able to speak with the director and got the depakote replaced with seraquel. Fingers crossed.",2021-12-24 07:40:47,roosterbru,rnljzv
Alzheimers,Suggestions for checkbook alternatives?,"Mom is mid-stage (Good days, Stage 4, bad days, exhibits some Stage 6) and this month, she used up all of her checks.

We have FPOA & manage her finances. We let her keep the checkbook to ease the losing independence transition as she's not pleased about how much we've ""taken over her life."" It was no big deal for a long time, she mostly just sends birthday checks to grandkids, but over the last year as her condition progressed, she was writing checks to shady charities (looking at you, Fund to ""Save"" Social Security) and ordering supplements toting miracle cures. Last year's tally was about $2500 in bad faith charity donations & about $6k in supplements.

Since she ran out of checks a couple of weeks ago, we'd stalled, hoping she'd forget about it. But she's getting more insistent. We don't want to order more for her because $7-10k a year to con artists is hard to stomach, both financially & emotionally.

Has anyone else come up with a good solution for this?

We talked about ordering some generic checks online that aren't linked to her bank account & tell family to let us know when they get one & we'll venmo them. And while I am personally totally fine with sending fake checks to the supplement & charity scams, I'm worried it could be construed as fraud unless we figure out a way to make it clear the checks aren't legal tender, which she might notice if we print that on the checks.

Holding her mail isn't an option, unfortunately. She puts her mail in a postal box on her walking route.","So sorry this is happening.

You can get her checks that require your signature and her signature in order for the check to be valid. You can set it up with the bank that way. That's what we did.

There are other things you can do:

■ You can ask that checks not be mailed to her home and that they come directly to you. 

■ You can keep her money in another account, and only send money to the checking account that you think she needs. Don't let her have access to $10,000+ so that she can spend like that. Figure out amongst your family what you think is a good amount for her to have and only place that amount in the account. The only bad part is that she might write overdrafts because she might not realize that the account has limits on it. 

■ Make it so that her checking account does not respond to checks - only an ATM card that you control. 


■ You can get her one of those cards where you add money to it, and it only has a certain amount of money in it. And? They have cheques for those cards. So she would only be writing checks against the amount that's on that card. But then again? See might write overdrafts because she's not thinking clearly that the account is limited.

■ You can let the bank know what's going on, and see what they suggest. They probably have experience with this type of thing. 

The two signature process worked for us.

It sounds like (for the amount of money she's giving out) it's going to escalate. 

She must be on a list of people who are known to fall for scams.

Also?

I did not allow my relative to take any supplements unless approved by their doctor. The doctor should control everything in regards to medicine that she takes (either over the counter medications or through a pharmacy).

If she is taking these unknown supplements? You need to let her doctor know about them, so that you can look at the ingredients with them and throw them away if they are not good for her.


Tell her you're going through this process because there are so many people out there trying to take advantage of her and steal her money.

Tell her you want to protect her funds. Tell her that her sense of independence is very important to everyone.


Also? 

You might want to contact a lawyer.

I'm very happy she has you to look after her.

Stop the junk mail before it comes to the house. I had a very similar problem to you. [This is my guide to stopping junk mail](https://drowndinginmail.wordpress.com/start-here/). You can do all of the prep work yourself without her knowing. If you can get a [PaperKarma](https://www.paperkarma.com/) account (Full disclosure I have a relationship with PaperKarma), every time you go over to the house take photos of the junk mail. 

As for the supplement companies, try to grab a copy of the catalogs and use a [USPS From 1500](https://drowndinginmail.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/drowning-in-junk-mail-how-to-stop-scam-junk-mail/) to make them stop. If everything goes right they will stop in 30 days.
I went through the exact same thing - scummy charities and all. It was recommended to me to have her bank open a new account, move all funds, and let any checks to charity bounce. Before I tried this I decided to just remove her checkbook from her purse and see how she would respond. Admittedly, I got pretty lucky so this may not work out for others. For a couple of days she would occasionally ask where her checkbook was and I'd pretend not to know or make an excuse. After about a week or two she had completely forgotten about it and never brought it up again. Occasionally I'll have to sneak small amounts of cash in her purse so she doesn't feel completely broke, but that's about it. Also worth noting it helps to intercept junk mail before she sees it.
Tell her that her contributions to these charities are poor money management and therefore, you don't want her writing any more checks.  I take it you are paying her bills from this same account using online banking?  Tell her you will help her with any payments she wants to make but they have to meet your approval.

Let her have her little snit.  It has to happen sometime.  I have had little snits with my loved one having to face his own limitations with the disease, and it just continues as things progress.  My rule has been not to take away any privileges until he shows that he cannot manage them properly.  For the most part, it has worked out okay.
My neighbor got wiped out (hundreds of thousands) by a guy who took checks from her for bogus work.  My other neighbor gave thousands and thousands to scam callers.  Shut down the checks immediately and turn off the phone.  My mom went to the back and got thousands in cash.  It went missing.
I haven’t had this issue yet with my aging parents but sounds like you have been given great tips.

What I can help you with is unwanted/unneeded non-first class mail (aka junk mail).

Register her address with USPS informed delivery…

Use this to keep an eye on her mail and to eliminate any unneeded USPS mailers. See my posts on this topic.

Register her with DMAChoice (caretaker option) - be sure to include ALL info listed on her truepeoplesearch listing(s).",2021-12-23 20:11:08,ImaginaryMaps,rnacgl
Alzheimers,Is it normal for caregivers to be forceful with an alzheimers patient?,"Not physically of course. 

I work as a cleaner and I clean at an elderly womans house who has the disease. While I'm there workers come to make sure she has lunch and takes her pills.

&#x200B;

 Anyway today the person came and helped her fix the plate but she kept saying she wasn't hungry. The woman was not having it. She didn't yell or anything and I get she only has so much time there but she was like 'no you are going to sit down and eat'. Really treating her like a 4 year old. Do they not know when they are hungry or something? 

I clean for around 3 hours and I can see that the woman is not completely out of it or anything like that. Is it normal to not let her decide things? I mean shes a grown woman not a child. I noticed her daughter does the same thing.","Oh, there's so much that goes into this. Never to be rude or forceful, but you do need to be insistent and take charge.

- Schedules are really important. It helps give people with dementia some stability

- Some meds require food or have to be taken on an empty stomach, so schedules are also physically important

- Issues with chewing and swallowing are very common with dementia. Ideally, someone will be there watching to make sure the food is actually swallowed and not held in the mouth or choked on. 

- Refusing all food is one of the earliest signs of the final decline. Sure, my lil buds might hate the food or not be hungry one day, but I can always get them to try a few bites. If they're refusing all meals over and over, I have to kick it upstairs since they may be entering their last weeks.

- Dementia is a lot about what you don't see. You might see me at work being insistent that someone eats, but you wouldn't necessarily see them shouting, tipping over chairs, and barging into the kitchen two hours after lunch if we let them get away without eating. A lot of daily care is mitigation to avoid the potential blowups that the people with dementia can't comprehend for themselves.
I think you have some very good comments already, but I want to take a moment and applaud you for checking in and making sure this was something that is normal and not a concern. It takes real bravery and a large heart to ask and take the time to learn. A lot of people would have assumed it's fine and left it as it was, even when sometimes their instinct was right and there was severe abuse going on.   


Never lose this instinct to ask questions and to learn. Sometimes, you're going to be right and something really is wrong. This can end up saving lives.    


I remember when I was younger, I was so worried about being rude or assuming. But it is better to ask; there really is no harm in asking if someone needs help. As I've aged, I've gotten so much better at determining if someone is in need or not - and the only way I've done it is by asking and learning.
Well since I don’t know this woman’s care plan all I can say is my mom is a 64 year old woman physically but mentally she’s 4. She cannot make her own decisions. She would not know how to prepare herself something to eat. My mom went through a phase where she was always hungry. She literally could have eaten 5 minutes ago and would totally forget about it. I can definitely imagine it goes the opposite way too. 

The workers and daughter maybe could be more patient, but to be honest they’re most likely so understaffed and overworked that they’re trying to keep a schedule.
If the caregiver and her daughter both treat her like this, perhaps that means it's effective.  Supposedly, it's better to trick the person, lie to them, etc.  Is that any more acceptable to you?
[deleted]
Everyone is different.  Unless you are seeing something you think of as abuse, don't stick your nose in.  I have gone through quite a few phases in which effective methods of anything were totally contradictory to what had worked before.
Ut may be different in America, but in Germany the rule is easy and simple.

The will of a person with dementia is as respected as the will of a person without. Nobody is forced to do anything, If a person with dementia refused to eat, this has to be respected. That is a basic human rule, that can not be taken away. 

The trick, nonetheless, is to find out if a person really doesn't want to eat. 

But in that case, the rules are simple: If the person say, she isn't hungry, she isn't hungry, and is not forced to eat. 

I will try to change her mind, but I will not use force, I will not argue to no end. 

I have had that situations, that a person isn't hungry. This can be different the next day. 

People with dementia are NOT to be treated like a 4-year-old. They are NOT ordered to do something. They are to be respected. 

In America this may be different, but not in Germany. 

AND: Do NOT try to lie to a person with dementia. They have an excellent radar for that.",2021-12-22 17:03:30,that_fresh_life,rmfzs6
Alzheimers,My father is on his deathbed due to his body shutting down from sedation and I have questions,"Edit: my father passed away at 3:13 am holding my mother’s hand while my brother, sister and I were laying down five feet away. Collectively, we spent three days camped out in this room. Thank you for all your kind words and comments. 

Original post:

Alzheimer's/dementia runs in my father's side of the family. My grandfather died from it, albeit, gradually over 20 years. He was docile and kind the entire span of his life. So when my father, then 71, was diagnosed with mild cognitive decline 3 years ago, we very much expected him to take a similar course. That is absolutely not what has happened.

He declined so rapidly we could barely keep up. 5 months ago we finally chose (after touring dozens) a specialty Alzheimer's care center for him to go and live. He moved in and his memory and behavioral issues advanced. He began to become aggressive when his diaper was being changed or he needed to be washed, or put in new clothes. Soon after this began, his aggression became more and more frequent, until he had an incident in which he struck out at a nurse.

The care center put him in an ambulance and sent him to the hospital, who called us to inform us that my dad was in the ER. They submitted him to the Psychiatrics ward in order to try and balance his meds and find a proper combination of antipsychotics that would allow him to continue living life in a comfortable manner. I should note, he was physically healthy. Big guy, just slightly overweight, had worked outside his entire life. The doctors said he might be there for a week, and due to Covid, no visitors were allowed.

A week passed and the doctors were very transparent about informing us of all the different drug cocktails they were trying. None were working. He was still aggressive while nurses were performing CARES and it often took 3-4 people to restrain him. One week turned into two, and eventually five. At the end of the 5th week, they suddenly permitted my mom and older sister to visit him for one hour. We were puzzled. The next day they asked for a meeting and explained to us that there was nothing they had tried that worked, and no care center would take him back in this state. They explained that over the last five weeks he had fallen very deep into the dementia, and insisted that the best option was to begin heavy sedation, rendering the body unable to eat or drink until it shuts down. My mother, as power of attorney, agreed to this. They gave us each one hour to visit and say goodbye while he was still alert and began the sedation the next day. This was one week ago.

He has not eaten or drank for at least six whole days and we have been by his bedside for almost 48 hours. There have been so many moments where we just question, over and over again, how this is legal, and this is the only solution. Aren't we literally killing him by sedating him to death? Has anyone else had this experience? Please shed some light on this for me.","If it were me, and I didn’t live in a state where euthanasia was legal, I would want to be sedated until the end. I think this is the kindest of your options. We treat animals at the end of life more compassionately than we treat humans. My heart goes out to you. 😢
Everything with ALZ is excruciatingly slow, except the end. The end comes quick. My dad had early onset, was relatively healthy, and had great care at a full time memory care facility. A few months in he started lashing out. I think it was because he had a UTI or some other underlying ailment that was making him uncomfortable, but he was unable to communicate in any other way but physical aggression. At some point he had a fall and broke his hip. This led to surgery, which led to pneumonia, which was exacerbated because ALZ combined with pain medication destroyed his ability to eat or drink. No nutrients + pneumonia is not ideal. He declined from there and was taken to hospice care. Once in hospice that’s pretty much the end of the line. Doctors disconnected the feeding tubes because the goal is not to extend life, but rather to make sure it ends as painlessly as possible. He received a variety of pain medications and anti hallucinatory meds. My mom and I were by his bedside the entire time. 

I quickly learned about the different stages of dying. There are three or four depending on who you ask. The only thing I can compare it to is the birthing process, except in reverse order. Birth starts quietly. Nothing really is happening and then the water breaks, which leads to a period of transition. It ends with the emergence of a loud, crying new life. In contrast, the first stage of dying is called “Active dying.” This was excruciating to watch. My dad thrashed and moaned, he was in a lot of discomfort. I’m not sure how aware he was of what was happening, but as his son a small part of me was proud that he was fighting his disease to the very last. After many hours, this period gave way to a transition where the medicine kicked in and his heart rate, breathing, and behavior stabilized. He was on a lot of medicine and his breathing became loud and mechanical. It went on like this for several days. We didn’t leave his side. Due to covid there could only be two family members in the room at any time, so my sisters and I had to rotate in and out. We had time to speak with him and hold his hand and talk about the good memories and the hard times. It was very cathartic. Eventually the nurse called us all in. She said his breathing looked labored and she thought it might be time to say our final goodbyes. My mother and two sisters and I put our hands and our heads on our fathers chest. We told him we loved him and that we were proud of him and that he was doing a very brave thing. We gave him permission to take the final step. He took a few more breaths and then there were no more breaths. It felt like an optical illusion. There was only silence. It still is. We cried and laid with him for a long time. It was raining outside. We had gotten so used to watching him struggle with ALZ for so long that we didn’t know what to do next. We were sad, but we were also thankful. It was over. He was free. He was whole again.

I think it’s normal for the hospice experience to be very confusing and scary. How could it not be? Keep asking questions and getting the information you need. I wish you and your family strength during this difficult time.
I'm a social worker who works with folks living with dementia and have never heard of this kind of situation of ""intentionally sedating someone so they don't want food or drink"". They may be using reasoning that he is hospice eligible and needs pain managed...? It may be helpful requesting a hospice consult or patient advocate who is able to help support you through this time. Hospice is so underutilized especially with dementia and could help clarify info you're receiving from the medical team. Take care of yourselves - this is such a devastating disease. You and your mom are doing the best you can with the information you have 💓
Wow, thanks for sharing your story. I'm curious to hear others' thoughts too. It is crazy that this was the only option when in some states they allow assisted suicide that is fast and much less painful.
oooooh if you go through my history you will see a very similar situation. It's a shit situation, because caregivers like us DO NOT KNOW what to do in these situations. We are not professionals. we are doing the best we can. It is literally sedating them to death.

I am so sorry. This is so hard. You must be scared, your family scared. We don't know what to do. It's not your fault. Be there now for you father.
I'm really sorry you and your father are in this situation. It sounds dreadful and a lot to wrap your head around in a short period of time. Especially since your father is relatively young. 

Yes, the drugs are hastening his death. And yes, this does happen to other people. Often the wording is""he's not getting better, we can't do any more for him, do you want us to just keep him comfortable?"" (which naturally the family agrees to because what else are they going to say?) and then the medical staff is a bit too aggressive with keeping him ""comfortable"". I find the wording you used in your post of what they said, including the insistence, and that the ""solution"" was preceeded with ""no one else will take him"" to be disturbing.  Although they told you about all the various medications they tried, they neglected to discuss various possibilities with you during the 5 weeks and suddenly dropped this all on you with ""insistence"" for you to agree to their proposal. It is irresponsible, unethical, and indecent in my opinion. One fact is that insurance will not pay them anymore since your Dad is not improving and they can't release him and get a paying patient in his bed if he doesn't have any place to go. I only know this reality because I work in hospitals and acute care facilities. But that doesn't mean that your Dad's future was not bleak. Legalities and ethics aside, what we do know for sure is: Your Dad has advanced dementia. He has been suffering for a while (the psychotic issues behind the aggression is not at all comfortable or pleasant for him). Advanced dementia and dying a slow death from dementia is dreadful.  Most people that have been through this would rather have their loved one die of something else like a heart attack or cancer earlier on to avoid the lingering and suffering of advanced dementia. He's not suffering now and he'll leave his body in the most gentle way possible surrounded by people that love him. I think it's a blessing that you have been able to say goodbye and stay with him. 

Again, I'm so sorry. Including that you got stuck in the ""no visitors due to Covid"" nightmare. That happened with my Dad too and it feels/felt awful. I think all people with dementia should always be allowed one caregiver present to be their advocate no matter what - just like with children.  

It doesn't matter at this point, but I'm wondering if this is a geriatric psych ward versus a regular psych ward.
Op, I accidentally replied to someone else, but see what I commented. I wish you luck. Hopefully some social service programs in your area may be able to help.
What country do you live in? If the United States, which state?
Hi, probably we are not from the same country, but we have had exactly the same experience. The illness developed quickly for my father, so quickly he went from not recognizing us, to escaping, being aggressive and finally struck the caregiver within the timespan of five months.

At that point he was hospitalized while the doctors tried to figure out the right cocktail of anti-psicotics that worked for him, none of which did.

One day I went to see him and it was so terrible, he was semi-sedated, constrained to the bed, in the grip of convulsions, and had lost the capability of talking. I asked what happened, if It was becuse of the medicines, but the doctors said it was the course the illness had taken. Still not convinced to this day.

Then finally, shortly after, the doctor called and asked me, the third of three sons, if they could just sedate him and stop feeding him. I said yes, go ahead, he was suffering so much It was Hell on earth for him. I knew the doctor called me, and not my mother nor my elder brothers because she wanted a positive answer, and she could see I was the most lucid in the family.  He passed after two days.

So, apparently it Is legal, they absolutely would not do It otherwise. Probably It Is the doctor that establishes that the end is near anyway and that they can stop the suffering.
So sorry for you loss.
Sorry if this is an insensitive summary or if I'm misinterpreting, but it sounds like they're going for euthanasia because they couldn't control his aggression and nobodu would take him?
What country are  you? Just saying this way of peace to pass  does not happen.  Let's just keep them even in a veggie state collecting money!
Hi OP, I'm very sorry for your loss. I am glad your family was there to keep him company and hold his hand. I had a very similar experience almost a month ago. My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2018 and had an extremely rapid decline in 2020. We ended up needing to move him in to memory care early 2021 for his safety. In September, there began to be some issues with my dad and some other residents. Gradually this changed to aggression, especially at changing his diapers and cleaning times. His facility was kicking him out. 

We called every memory care and skilled nursing facility in the state and every geriatric psych unit and absolutely nobody would take a man with ""behaviors"". the geri psych units were understaffed and couldn't take him. It was a nightmare. We began looking out of state for care facilities. We finally got my dad on hospice and we asked about further medicating but due to state regulations, they can't just sedate someone heavily just because. They decided to start him on low doses of dilaudid and my dad didn't slow down a bit. He was up and about, walking, talking (jibberish). Hospice called his aggression ""terminal agitation""; that was a new one for me.

We got very lucky and found another facility who would take him so we planned his move date. Got him settled at his new facility and he passed suddenly 2.5 weeks later with very little warning. He had only stopped being able to swallow the night before. I got a call from hospice to say they thought he was transitioning to actively dying. I let them know I could be down in a few hours or immediately if they thought it was urgent. they said no need to rush and come on down whenever I can. Well, I got a call 30 minutes later that he'd passed. It was so quick. 

It's been quite the rollercoaster of emotions; mix of relief and sadness. I'll be thinking about you, OP",2021-12-22 18:26:26,lemonsqueezers,rmhogt
Alzheimers,Need advice as the Granddaughter,"Hi, so long story short, my grandma currently has Alzheimer's, and my mom and I have also lost a dear family friend who was also like a grandma to her to Alzheimer's a few years back. I'd wanted to donate to the Alzheimer's Foundation for a while and in November, I was able to raise a lot of money that I will be donating. 

Here's where I need advice: My mom has had a harder time with this than I have and has been more directly affected, so I want to make this donation special to honor everything my mom has done to support the two women in our lives who have had it and to honor my grandma and our family friend. 

I'm not sure of the etiquette of this and I don't want it to be interpreted wrong. When I first ran the idea by my brother, his immediate reaction was 'Well Gram isn't dead. Don't you do this stuff after they die?' and now I'm unsure of the best way to go about anything. I know 'In Honor of' is different than 'In Memory of' but if both names are on it then will that be interpreted wrong? 

I'm probably overthinking it all, as I do with most things, but I've never done anything like this and I don't want to mess something up.","I think *In Memory of...* does certainly suggest posthumous, whereas ""honoring"" someone could be done in life as likely as in death. I don't know, maybe it'd make things simpler to do to one each to make a clear delineation between the current statuses of each woman?  And then maybe this way you can pick and choose who learns of each donation, to make sure there isn't any misunderstandings or preemptive notions of Gram's death.",2021-12-22 12:51:59,KatyOnTwitch,rman1v
Alzheimers,Mom called,"My mom called today and said there was a man in the house she did not recognize.  I asked if it was my Dad and she responded by saying her Dad has been dead for years. I asked if the man in the house was ****, my Dads name, and she had no idea how I knew him.  

My heart sank and I’m finally having to face how bad her memory has become.  This is brand new to me and I have no idea how to deal with this.  Please provide any and all advice you can; I would really appreciate it","Is your dad her primary caretaker? I would be checking in with him often. My grandma forgets who I am sometimes, so I reintroduce myself often during our phone calls. Part of this will be coaching and supporting dad as much as caring for mom. It’s usually best to enter her reality while still being reassuring. Maybe you could tell her to put the man on the phone and you’ll help her figure it out?
When I was at camp with my scouting group my mom called me. She was scared and alone according to her. I kept asking if my stepdad was near her but she said she  couldn't find him. So I tried to get her to yell my dads name. After a few tries she finally yelled his name and he came downstairs and told me everything is fine and he would take care of her. I was so scared because my dad could have gotten unwell or something worse. 

My advice would be to get a photo of her husband and put his name or a hart underneath it so maybe she can look at it and know it's okay. It helped for a while with my mom untill she was too far gone",2021-12-20 23:30:05,everybodywantsome,rl65le
Alzheimers,Call for the Accelerated Withdrawal of Aducanumab,,"I support the petition. I admit I am just a lay person who seriously started 5 years ago trying to find out what was wrong with my wife. But I read the study paper and the trial(s) had a lot of flaws from beginning to end. I read the paper a few months back so feel free to read it and tell me where my memory is faulty. They started off with a group of approximately 1500 people. Half given a placebo the other half divided into three groups, each given three different amounts of Aducanumab the length of the study. Double-blind etc. About half way through this first study group’s testing period, they replicated the first study group with another group of 1500 people in a different part of the world. When they were 3/4 quarters of the way through with the first group and a quarter of the way through with the second group, they realize that there was absolutely no difference between Aducanumab and the placebo. So they doubled the Aducanumab dosage for the two groups. Now the administrators of the study know who is receiving Aducanumab, so it is not a double blind study anymore and a lot of the study results were subjective. When they couldn’t do anything with data from the first group, they used the excuse given the length of time the first group received the increased dosage and ignored their data. With the second group they couldn’t find any cognitive improvement, statistically significant or not. So they heavily parsed the data to try and find someway to salvage the study. They used sample sizes in the teens to show Aducanumab effectiveness at reducing protein plaque buildup. Protein plaque buildup in the brain is the current theory on what causes dementia, but some experts argue that it might be a symptom of something else that is the cause. There was also a very large number of participants reporting serious side effects.

Aducanumab costs 56k a year. It is not approved in Europe. While I think they should continue to study the drug, I would like to see the resources go to something else.

Alzheimers,Grandmother forgetting death & risky internet searches,"I’m caring for my grandmother this winter and while doctors have not given her a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s she has some pretty serious memory problems. 

Her husband died this summer and it took her a very long while to be able to remember that for more than a few minutes at a time. They were married for 50 years and became very codependent so his passing has been extremely hard for her to deal with. 

I am not able to live with her during most of the year meaning that she is often alone for most of the day. I have begun to monitor her when she uses the computer because she routinely enters google searches like “find *husband’s name*” and ends up on very risky “background check” websites. I am fairly lost concerning what to do because I don’t want her to be taken advantage of but I also don’t want to put up a sticky note reminding her because every time she is told about his passing she shuts down for hours at a time. She also would remove any sort of note in order to “tidy up.” I am also unable to place parental controls on the internet browser as she still uses the AOL desktop application which removed parental controls in 2017.

I am very worried about her because, as mentioned I will not be able to be with her all day starting in the spring and the rest of my family works during the day. My father (the power of attorney) has also been highly resistant to getting some form of home healthcare because he greatly underestimates the amount of care needed (because he has never had to care for her).

I really don’t know what to do so any advice is much appreciated. Thank you and have a great day!

Edit: Thank you all for your suggestions and encouragement. My mom is planning to bring the family together and talk about how we can improve my grandmother’s care. Wish us luck that the meeting goes well!","Time to gather the family and get her help. She does not need to be left alone. The feasibly needs to get together get organized and get her in to see her doc then a referral to find out what is causing this. Could be tons of things. 

It's awesome you are there and are looking out for her.
Waa, so sorry for that,, it's hard.  And very sad that she's alone always & searching for husband.  If she's in a state that she can't remember that he's passed away, seems she needs a diagnosis & so on, to instigate & enable getting some in-home-care or something.   Yr dad needs to pull his finger out!   Get some pamphlets / info from yr relevant / local Alzheimers .org or Dementia .org, for yr info & for your dad.  Ask advice from dementia .org.   Do you know who is her GP doctor?  Go speak with them about yr concerns regarding her.  

My mum also, can't remember that some family members have passed recently, (now, nor the ones that passed away years ago already).  For the recent ones, I get the memorial service booklet thing, put them on the kitchen sideboard with other photos etc.  She has easier to remember they have passed away.  Could you next time you're there, maybe make a shelf shrine for grandpa, in an obvious place.  A memorial service print-out, or create one yrself with a photie of grandpa, with RIP Grandpa June 23, 2021... Maybe also a nice photo of his tombstone, with flowers or something?  Idk, sometimes it's kinder for them to not be reminded of losses constantly, but other times, it's cruel that they are endlessly waiting & searching for them, don't know wtf happened why aren't they there.... Idk... 

So sorry... It's sad, just how it is...   Good on you for caring!   \* hugs \*
Perhaps there is a way you can get your father (POA) and her together and leave them alone for a while. It's hard to accept this horrible disease is eating your loved ones brain and sometimes only firsthand knowledge will wake some people up to what is happening.
I agree she needs to be looked at by her doctor. there are a lot of things that seem like dementia. Vitamin deficiency, depression, and other imbalances that can be reversed . If she is depressed or lonely it can contribute to her memory issues ,from my understanding . Maybe  with the holidays you can get your dad to spend the day with her so he can observe what’s going on . You said she lost her husband, I’m assuming your dad has lost his dad. He may be having a hard time emotionally with the death as well, especially during the holidays , maybe he doesn’t want to confront the situation . I’m just guessing here not knowing the family dynamic. Covid hasn’t helped either. It has been tough on all of us. I hope everything works out for you and your grandmother . She’s lucky to have you around and you shouldn’t feel guilty if you cant be with her as much as you would like.",2021-12-20 18:07:03,LucilleAnn_51,rkzr0q
Alzheimers,OKLAHOMA Alzheimer's Patient Signs Power of Attorney - legal??,"My mom has Alzheimer's and in early November was placed in assisted living.   
The issue: in October my brother had his attorney draw up a POA, which she signed and this was witnessed by 2 people.  His attorney claims this was legal to do.

Mom can't remember things past a 15 minute timespan.  The POA she signed gives him complete control, that is, he is not a conservator for her estate.  

He now is acting like the house and all her items are his to dispose of as he pleases.   For example, after eating dinner at the local diner, he offered her items to the waitress.  

As her money pays for her nursing home care, these items should be sold, not given away.  When I pointed this out, he got super angry at me, told me to get out, then called the police on me when I didn't (and yes,  the cops came and told me to leave, which I did).

I don't think he's acting in her behalf as she would wish.  

Shouldn't someone with POA work in the interests of the trust? 

Does an absolute POA grant the power to change her will/trust?

Ugh, he has all the money so I'm unsure if I could even afford to contest his POA.   

Thank you in advance for any advice and *thank you*.","You need to get a lawyer right away. If she's as far gone as you say she is, she should not be able to legally sign something like that. A lawyer should be able to prove based on her medical records (especially since she's in a home) that she is not in her right mind to do something like that. Even if you're afraid if would cost too much, an initial phone call is free.  

Other people here might have links or resources when it comes to elder abuse. You could also always check the more legal sides of Reddit to see what other options you might have.
Hi, work for a probate litigator and yes, you definitely have reason to file suit against your brother for abusing his fiduciary duties as your mother’s agent.  But I am sorry to say that hiring an attorney is very expensive.  But it might be worth it if you are afraid of your brother taking advantage of your mother.  Good luck!
It's legal if the attorney says she had the capacity to understand the documents at the time, which he will. This is called testamentary capacity and the bar for this is very low. Someone can have dementia and still have testamentary capacity. You would need to hire a lawyer and litigate if you wanted to fight it. And you would need hard evidence that she did not have capacity (not simply a diagnosis). Or, you would need to pursue guardianship and convince the judge that you or someone else should be named guardian instead of the person your Mom chose. Both are expensive and time consuming with no guarantee of success - and the odds are not in your favor.

Is he successor trustee of a trust in addition to POA?  No, a successor trustee/POA can not change a will or trust. The trustee needs to follow the directions written in these documents. If the POA/Trust says he can sell her home and dispose of her belongings (which it likely does), then he can do it. If he's selling her house, he probably has a lot of items to dispose of, including plenty that have little to no value. What do you expect him to do with all the stuff? Sometimes, things need to be given away. He needs to clear out the house in order to sell it.

Someone needed to get POA and step in to start caring for your Mom. It sounds like he stepped up to the plate.
Call your local bar association and ask for a referral to your state’s legal aid network. You need a family law attorney, possibly someone that specializes in elder abuse and estate law. It sounds like a lot of what he’s doing (giving away her stuff, trying to change her will) is not in her best interest, and a court will be very interested in that. Double check… but I think POA gives him full ability to manage her affairs, but doesn’t supersede her will in terms of appointing him executor of her estate in the event of her incapacitation or her death. It’s complicated. It might all come down to if he’s acting in her best interest. Best of luck!

Edit- if he got her to sign POA AFTER HER DIAGNOSIS you can point out to the court that his POA is invalid because she signed after being diagnosed with a degenerative disease THAT AFFECTS HER MENTAL CAPACITY. Shame on that lawyer and those witnesses for allowing this if they had knowledge of her diagnosis. The proper process should have been to take medical documentation of her disease to the court and petition for guardianship or conservatorship. Not convince her to sign POA hello she can no longer understand or appreciate what she’s signing and that is super shady. Ugh this makes me so angry for you and your mom.",2021-12-19 18:14:55,stfucupcake,rk8icn
Alzheimers,Dishwasher?,"Any advice on dishwashers? My dad loves to putter in the kitchen loading or unloading the dishwasher, cleaning counters, and hand washing large items. It's been his job since I was a kid. Mom would cook and dad would clean.  Recently, I noticed him putting dirty items into the clean dishwasher. And mom caught him trying to put dirty items back in the cupboard. 

I would hate to take this activity away from it because it seems to give him purpose and he seems to enjoy puttering for hours over a 10 minute cleanup. :)

I bought one of those clean/dirty signs but I'm pretty sure he isnt capable of reading/comprehending it. Should my mom or myself stand in the kitchen with him like a drill Sargeant inspecting his work? Should we tell him we will be doing it from now on? Find him another activity every time he tries to do dishes? Switch to paper plates? Is there such a thing as a dishwasher lock?","The appliance lock when the dishwasher is dirty may work. I work with some families that use them in the kitchen https://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Multi-Purpose-Appliance-Packaging/dp/B00AS693R2

It does sound like it’s a good activity for him. when it comes to activity it’s not really the end result or product that matters, it’s the process of doing that’s important. We all need meaning and purpose and a feeling of accomplishment. Maybe if the dishwasher is locked you could have another dish related activity like sorting silverware or putting away clean items sitting out. It doesn’t hurt to make up stuff to do and someone living with dementia will often happily do the same thing again and again.
Sorry I don’t have any suggestions, just wanted to say I’m glad I’m not the only one dealing with dirty dishes being put back in cabinets.
As his memory declines he will rely more and more on habits. His executive function is not able to analyze clean/dirty…, but his habit memory will allow him to do some things (load or unload) because the brain stores these habits in a different place. Keeping these habits will help him be more independent as time passes. 

You may have to watch him or create times where he does his job while supervised. For his sake keep him HELPING. You want to protect his self worth and foster his need to be needed as long as possible. Be thinking now of tasks that he can do, fold towels, sort socks… down the road. The ability to do things disappears, but the need to be loved and needed stay to the end. 

I’m sorry I don’t have a good suggestion for you. I lost my mother in August to this horrible disease. Doing things kept her calm and happy. That’s why I share this.
We have this problem too.  I had a little trouble rolling the lower rack back in so I asked him if he could do that.  Half an hour later he had most of the internal parts disassembled and laid out on the floor.

I have had to ask him to stop using the washing machine (laundry), dishwasher, coffee maker, telephone, and cords to various devices (lift chair, heating pad, CPAP machine).  He can still reheat coffee in the microwave though we've had to replace it once because he melted something mechanical inside it.  The thermostat is always being fiddled with, too.

He has the ego of a full grown man with the judgment and common sense of a toddler.  It's very trying.  You really have to watch them as closely as you would watch a 2 year old.
My only advice is be as proactive as possible to avoid these situations as best you can. It sucks. My mother will also do these things. So to keep her from putting dirty items in with the cleaned dishwasher I have to put everything up as soon as the cycle finishes. If there's anything dirty in the sink I have to be sure to put it in the dirty dishwasher as soon as I see it or it'll end up back in the cabinet. She also has a bad habit of wanting to use dishwasher pods for the clothes washer and tide pods for the dishes. At a certain point you really have to watch them like a hawk. Notes and written instructions only helped at first.
Agree with Lonestar.  I learned to empty dishwasher  asap after it finishes running so it always has dirty dishes in it.",2021-12-19 08:37:23,luvsalltheanimals,rjwx2i

Alzheimers,Advice for managing emotions at Christmas time,"Hi Everyone, 
I'm sure I'm not the only one finding the lead up to Christmas especially hard, does anyone have any suggestions with how to cope? 

My husband and I live in a different state to my parents and now that we're staying with them I'm finding it really upsetting to see how much Dad has declined over the last year.

Dad always asks where I see myself in 10 years' time and usually I give really elaborate answers. Today I responded by asking where he saw himself in 10 years and he said that he didn't think he'd be around. I got so upset that I burst into tears and asked him not to say that. He patted me on the shoulder and said that it would be okay but he'd had a nice life and we all had our time.

He has a few other conditions and I had this horrible moment of realisation that he probably won't be here for too much longer. 

Even though I'm in my thirties, I don't feel ready to live without my father. What strategies do people have to avoid getting so upset? 

x","Well, this is hard. Managing emotions around things that you haven’t had the time to face/address yet is difficult.

While you are visiting, I would focus on getting your parents to tell their stories. Make it a time to bond and learn things about them you may not have known before. Ask them about their childhood. The hopes and dreams they had. What they want to pass on to you in terms of lessons. This doesn’t have to be interview-like. Simply ask them some questions when it seems to be a natural transition in the conversation. And really listen and try to absorb the lessons and the moment. Most importantly, ENJOY your time with them. Try to keep in mind, your parents don’t want to see you completely torn up at the prospect of their death. Tell them how much you love them and appreciate them. Breathe deeply, and if you feel yourself starting to tear up, just try to assess whether or not it’s appropriate, or if you are just being overcome by emotions. This is difficult in the moment sometimes, but craft the visit as you want to remember it in the future. Make the interactions you have deep, meaningful, and hopefully happy, or at the very least nostalgically positive.

I would also suggest just spending some time mentally preparing and accepting the inevitability of death. This is deep work that we will all have to do at some point. If you find this particularly difficult, seek some counseling. I haven’t personally read it, but there is a book by Sadhguru called Death, and it has good reviews. I wish you the best. It is a journey to process our parents’ and our own mortality.
The most difficult thing in life is to learn to let go.
I don’t have much to add to the excellent advice you have already received. I just want to say how sorry I am that you are having to go through this. If it’s any consolation, know that you aren’t alone.",2021-12-18 09:47:40,Desperate_Culture_25,rj8yf5
Alzheimers,Is falling in love possible for an Alzheimer’s patient?,"I mean no disrespect by asking this question, I tried googling it at length but found nothing. I know someone who was diagnosed recently at only 60 following a stroke after years of alcohol abuse and well I am wondering what the future holds for him. This is someone I’ve been interested in for a long time and now I fear it may never happen for us. Thank you","I honestly don't even know how to answer this. 

I would never say love is impossible. And there is certainly nothing preventing someone from falling in love with someone with Alzheimer's.... But for the person with Alzheimer's, when you're short term memory suffers, and it becomes difficult to hold on to the present... Expectations should be *extremely* low for reciprocal love as time goes on.
I don't have an answer for you, but it poses an interesting dilemma, is someone with Alzheimer's able to consent? My doctor thought so when I was given Power of Attorney, but mum was more coherent back then. Now? I don't think she has any idea what reality is, let alone what consent means or requires.
I'm really curious about this too. My grandma goes on little dates with my neighbor and he is aware she has Alzheimer's. It's really cute, they'll sit together outside and listen to music and he brings over non-alcoholic beer for her. Afterwards, she'll come in and gush about how handsome he is and she could see them going on a real date.
Terms of common human experience, such as ""falling in love,"" have to be modified or qualified in the case of someone with Alzheimer's.

An Alzheimer's patient can certainly have fond feelings for another.  Patients can have sexual feelings and activities.  They can feel jealousy.  They probably will have diminished sensitivity to a partner's needs and feelings, relative to when they were fully healthy.
A second opinion may be good.  The likelihood of a person experiencing a stroke, chronic alcohol abuse, and early onset Alzheimer's is low.  To be clear, I'm not saying the likelihood of dementia is low.

The stroke and alcohol abuse could cause the cognitive changes alone. Assuming meds to prevent strokes and no more alcohol there will not necessarily be the type of decline seen in early onset Alzheimer's disease.

Without knowing the degree of impairments,  your question is difficult to answer though.
The last things that go with Dementia are feelings. All of them.

Even if all memories have left, emotions and feelings are there. 

People do fall in love of being old, and/or living in caring homes. 

There was this old lady from my neighborhood, who suffered from Alzheimer's, and lived in a caring home. There she met a man, years younger, who had dementia after a stroke. They felt in love.

But even if I didn't experience their love personally, I clearly can say that this was different and will be different for you from what you know as love.

I'm planning to work with demented people (They are NOT ""patients"", the term patient is a term of disrespect!) and I can assure you, that you will face problems. The biggest one will be: to make him fall in love with you. THAT you can not. And should not.

You don't force love onto others. No matter what they are and what they suffer from.

Maybe you can work for him, help caring for him, and see, what will happen.
You were interested in starting a relationship with an alcoholic? And now that he has dementia you still want a romantic relationship with him?  I think a better question to ask yourself is ""Why do I want this for myself?"".  You could explore this question with a good therapist.
if he is only 59, he really should be evaluated for other conditions that are causing similar symptoms before jumping to Alzheimer’s, they may possibly be treatable 
https://www.considerable.com/health/alzheimers/conditions-that-mimic-dementia/

That said. I think you can continue going on dates for quite some time, a few years even, as long as you and he are both enjoying each other’s company. Him conversing with a new person about interesting topics and activities can help to keep his mind sharper for longer. But I wouldn’t try to plan a “future” with him such as marriage.",2021-12-17 10:49:56,synthmesideways,rikarv
Alzheimers,Steps to prevent Alzheimer’s,"My paternal grandmother had Alzheimer’s disease. 

My dad has Alzheimer’s disease.

My basic readings suggest that this terrible disease can have a large genetic factor.

What are some concrete steps to prevent its onset in children of a parent with Alzheimer’s.","A few things that, as you become a senior, are very important to prevent any underlying dementia from fast forwarding: 

1. preventing falls: get good new shoes frequently, keep stuff off the floor, reduce the amount of furniture and clutter in the house. Each time a senior with dementia gets hospitalized with an injury, it seems to make the dementia fast forward

2. as soon as you start having hearing loss, get hearing aids and learn how to use them comfortably. They come with bluetooth apps nowadays so you can adjust the settings yourself for different environments. and even port music directly to your ears. Seniors with dementia and unaddressed hearing loss basically stop being engaged socially and just start checking out of conversation around them. When their family wants to tell them something, each time they must repeat it gets shorter with less detail and nuance. So the brain no longer processes complex information.

3. get your vaccines!! especially pneumonia and shingles. And flu snd covid vaccines, of course. my grandmother worked as an doctor’s office manager until age 80, she was very functional up until she was hospitalized due to Shingles. So the same principle as 1, to prevent hospitalization.
Not a doctor but there are many sources of information on the web  a few I have heard, good sleep, cut back on sugars, get excercise.  Just aa few to get the answers rolling in.
Hey there, sorry to hear about your dad and grandmother. I shared this info to a similar query recently so hopefully it helps!

Though there is no way to reverse dementia, lifestyle changes may slow progression of certain types of dementia and can help prevent dementia (or delay onset) in certain cases. 

If you want information about these lifestyle changes a really helpful (and free!) course about brain health is “Preventing Dementia” by The Wicking Dementia Centre. Apparently the next one isn’t until May but I highly recommend the course if you’re interested. It’s targeted towards the public so all info is explained really well and using simplified terms.

“Understanding Dementia” can be a helpful course to understand what is happening when it comes to your father.

Basic summary of the course reflects https://www.hellobrain.eu/en/

- Get physically active 
- Stay socially engaged (SO UNDERRATED! Communicating with others is one of the most complicated tasks we do)
- Challenge your brain
- Manage stress (easier said than done especially when caring for others)
- Lifestyle adaptations to protect your brain 

All of these changes are backed by science and while other things may be recommended the Wickings dementia course gives you information on how to determine whether the research is strong enough!


Best of luck, it may be comforting to know brain health is a growing area with ongoing research so it’s nice to know there are some things that can be done to minimise risks and help ourselves when things feel so out of control.
This is a great podcast on brain health which has driven me to take much better care of my diet following some scientists who look at the correlation between brain health and diet.

My family have hereditary early onset Alzheimer’s so it’s a big worry for me.
Hello friend, I am in the same position. We got this! Adding on to what others have said here's what I do:

- Practice Kirtan Kriya chanting meditation. 

Never meditated in my life and found this to be pretty easy.  It's described on the [Alzheimers website here](https://alzheimersprevention.org/research/kirtan-kriya-yoga-exercise) and I use [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKEAiwrgeY) as a guide, though there are many others.

Here are a few sources showing that this particular meditation is helpful to the brain:

https://www.ijhsr.org/IJHSR_Vol.11_Issue.1_Jan2021/IJHSR35.pdf

- I also practice intermittent fasting, stop eating at 6pm and start again at 10am. Your times may be different but it's basically 16 hours off/8 hours on. It sounds difficult but it's not once you get used to it.

- as others have said, try to eat veggies and fruit and make exercise a daily habit.

I can't endorse that from personal experience, just something I've been told is good to do.
I’m in this boat too. I’m 38, turning 39. So many people in my family have Alzheimer’s or dementia. I want to make sure that I do what I can. You’re not alone!
Retain your mental fitness, your cognitive sharpness, and your memory as you age. It will help to do all of the following: Consume a nutrient-dense mediterranean diet; Get enough sleep; Spend at least 1 hour a day on mentally demanding activities; Stay physically active so in particular work on your lower body strength, which provides some protection against falling which can result in a stroke which in turn can lead to dementia. And finally, avoid smoking.",2021-12-15 14:16:27,swinging_door,rh6vqr

This can happen with antipsychotic use.  It is called tardive dyskinesia in this case.  Haldol, abilify, zyprexa, geodon, and Risperdal are common ones that can cause this. If she's is, you can ask her doctor to stop it or switch to Seroquel.",2021-12-14 20:44:26,Darthmambo,rgn79d

Alzheimers,What was your experience like dropping off for Memory Care/Assisted Living?,"TL/DR - I'm very nervous on how the actual drop off is going to go down and I would appreciate any stories or advice you may have.

&#x200B;

Hello all,

Mom has been deteriorating pretty rapidly and can't be left alone anymore. She has become more confused and irate than in my last post and I don't think I'm able to provide the care she needs anymore. I've made a couple visits to facilities and will keep researching until I find the right fit (slightly overwhelmed in the different ways they provide care). However, while I'm searching I have also been feeling out how her reaction will be - and it does not bode well. Two weeks ago I took her to a doctor appointment and she asked ""You're not going to leave me here, are you?"" Which of course just crushed me knowing I will be leaving her somewhere soon. We had a great conversation last week where she was initially sad about the idea of moving to a care facility, but then came around. She became slightly optimistic and was at least interested in learning more. Unfortunately, that conversation did not stick. She has since mentioned that she will refuse to go anywhere else and once threatened to kill herself first. She's been experiencing a lot of emotional outbursts lately and I really have to be careful how I speak with her to avoid any issues. I really wanted this to be a mutual decision, or at least with her understanding slightly what was happening but at this point I think I'm going to have to surprise her. Which really sucks. 

So with all that - how did it go with you? Did you pretend the facility was something else? Did they read the sign in the parking lot and flip out? Did you stay for a while or leave immediately? I've heard that it's recommended to not visit for a couple of weeks so that they can get adjusted to the change. 

Thank you in advance!","I just took my mother in law and it was heartbreaking but also the absolute right thing to do. I did surprise her and she was pretty angry with me but she forgot and when I came after 2 weeks as recommended she was so happy to see me. it’s a terrible disease and it feels inhumane to take them but it’s also the most humane thing to do. I am so sorry you are going through this. You’re a good person trying to do the best for someone you love and you are!
It didn’t go well. She threatened to stop eating and kill herself. She has since forgotten where she is and things are going so much better.
My mom was physically violent at the time. Fortunately, the moment chose itself. She’d been irritated all week. She refused to leave the doctor’s office after a visit. She was convinced I was going to hurt her, etc. An ambulance was called, and she was taken to the local ER, where she was diagnosed with an abscessed tooth. She wasn’t complaining of any pain before that, but it may have been low level. Her cognitive level had deteriorated, and I decided, since she was in -patient anyway, that it was time. 

That was in May. She was in respite care for a couple of months while I tracked down a place that could handle her emotional outbursts.  Since then, she’s deteriorated fairly quickly, from walking to a wheelchair, to a support chair, and not eating a whole lot. I have a care plan meeting Thursday, and I expect we’ll discuss hospice at some point.
Luckily I was able to have the conversation about it with her a few times. Sometimes she didn't understand and grew upset, at which point I just dropped it, but there were a few times when she was either already calm or when the cause of her distress at the time was that she couldn't understand why things weren't right or were more difficult for her, so that lead to what I dubbed ""the Alzheimer's Conversation"" which generally helped calm her down because it explained why things were harder. In the moments where she understood that she had Alzheimer's, I could explain the home to her and she was generally ok with it. 

We knew which home it was going to be so I was able to show her pictures of it on my laptop. These conversations never stuck but they gave me hope because of her positive reaction. 

I hadn't previously worried too much about it because she'd always told me, even before having memory trouble, that if the time ever came where she had to move into a home that she would be more than happy to and that she would understand. She'd previously worked in mental health care homes so understood that they were good places.

Despite this, there were several times when she was in highly delirious and anxious states that she said she wanted to die.

I was dreading the actual drop off. She moved in in April this year, so it was still while my country was in lockdown. We had previously planned that when the time came, we'd visit the home a few times first together to get a feel for the place and then have a cup of tea together before me leaving her, but obviously that wasn't possible in the middle of the pandemic.

The day came to drop her off and luckily she was in an ok mood. We were allowed into the reception hall for me to talk to the deputy manager of the home for a few minutes and to pass them her suitcase and bags of belongings. Then it was time to say goodbye.

I don't know if she understood what was happening but she was in ok spirits and was happy enough to go with the staff members. I hugged her goodbye and that was it.

I wasn't able to see her for two weeks after that, as she had to quarantine because of covid. It was the longest I'd gone without seeing her for over a year and felt so strange.

She's since deteriorated a bit but has good times and bad times in the care home, but that's no different to how she would be at home.

It was really just down to luck that she was having a relatively good day on the day I had to drop her off. It could have gone completely the other way and I don't know what I would have done if that was the case.
I'm in the same boat. My brother and I might just lie and say they're doing renovations on the house so we can't be in the house for a bit.
I have not succeeded yet with a placement, I'm just beginning to go on visits.  (We have one scheduled tomorrow.)  I am taking him along, which might be a mistake.  He has said if he has to be locked in anywhere he will kill himself.  Thing is, since he wanders, it's a given that he will have to be in a locked facility.  I have told him if he's able to participate in choosing a place, that's to his advantage.  I have also told him I will be active in taking him to doctor appointments, family events and outings.  

He has gone willingly to adult day care, and one night after one of his elopements he was threatening suicide so he went to the ER and three days in a psych ward.  He actually seemed to enjoy the psych ward and I know he enjoys adult day care.  

I can't tell you that this approach is going to be successful.  But I do think that getting him involved in various kinds of facility care is paving the way.  This is based on what I've seen in my caregiver support group.

Assisted living is less restrictive than memory care, and I think some of those places are darn nice, with loads of activities and social life.  If she qualifies for that, it might appeal to her.

Good luck.  It's a scary decision to have to make.
Make sure that when you do decide on a facility, you express your concerns.  They really are the experts at handling such a situation.  My mom went right from the hospital, and she refused to get off the transport van & threatened to call the police.  The staff was able to calm her down and get her inside.  For about the first month or so, she would call and yell at me - say that she told the staff she doesn't have any children, say that she would rather be dead than be there, etc.  The calls eventually evolved into ""you've got to get me out of here"".  I actually would just let them go to voice mail - I learned that there were days & times she would call & I'd just send those calls to voice mail.  She finally settled in at about 8 months, and now she thinks she's still living in her old apartment with all of her friends.
My mom's experience started with an assisted living community that was supposedly well versed in Alzheimer's care. They weren't. My mom walked right past nurses and aides twice and went outside. 

We switched her to a memory care community when the director of that assisted living community admitted she was too much for them. I'm going to focus on our experience with them.

They had us bring Mom in for lunch. The chef came right out with a plate of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. My mom was overjoyed (wicked sweet tooth) and asked for coffee, so he told her to follow him. While he had her distracted, they had us leave. They said she had a few angry moments, but within six weeks she'd made friends. I'll never forget the day I went in and she told me she was happy to see me, but she and her friends had made plans, so she'd like it if I could come back later. I was overjoyed to see her happy.
I am in the same boat but haven’t started looking for care homes yet. I know I can’t handle her care for much longer but I can’t bring myself to do it. Reading some of the responses has helped me realize how common the progression of the disease is. Mom has started to get agitated and I never know if I’m going to get sleep or not. It is very exhausting. I hope all goes well with you and I will be checking the posts to see how things went. Good luck!!
It was a really nice place (that we probably can't afford).  He seemed doubtful, but did ask a few questions.  I think I wont take him on other visits, just because they will probably pale in comparison.",2021-12-14 19:18:26,Lonestar1911,rglgig
Alzheimers,Home for holiday?,"I’m looking for some advice or personal experience maybe? My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago and moved into a memory care home three months ago. She has had a hard time adjusting - says her life is over, she can’t believe her kids did this to her, everyone steals from her there. It’s actually a very nice place and we all visit often (there are three of us within an hours drive and we all go weekly).  I’m the youngest, I am married with a 7 year old daughter and very apprehensive about bringing mom home for Christmas. I know how awful that sounds. We brought her home for a weekend and it was a disaster by the second day. We brought her to my home again for Thanksgiving and she just ends up spiraling and crying and saying her life is over and she wants to die. The thought of my mom waking up alone on Christmas morning makes me ill, but the thought of having our first Christmas in our house be so chaotic and upsetting also makes me ill. I don’t even know if she would care that it’s Christmas. Am I making this more than it is because of my own guilt? It’s very upsetting for my daughter when my mom gets so upset and says the things she says. It’s a long story but my other siblings aren’t really willing to bring her “home” so it always falls on me. I feel so conflicted and just plain sad.","It's a very unfortunate situation. I sympathize. But if I were in your position I would not bring her home. Especially if things went poorly during Thanksgiving. And while it's only natural to feel guilty, you absolutely shouldn't. You're making the best of terrible circumstances. That's the best you can do.
I wouldn't. My dad went into memory care this summer and even getting him to go back after a doctor's appointment is a heartbreaking struggle. I took my laptop and helped him do some shopping, then helped him wrap and make tags, and we (his immediate family) are going to see him Christmas morning.

Part of Alzheimer’s is that no matter what you do and how hard you try, it's going to suck. Remember that just because a decision makes you feel guilty doesn't mean it was the wrong decision.

Side note on the stealing, yep dad thinks they're stealing his pencils and stuff but I've found every single thing he says is missing squirrelled away under the towels or behind the dresser or somewhere... I found this really helpful https://teepasnow.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-unfounded-accusations-when-dementia-is-involved/
She might not even realize it is Christmas unless you bring her home.  It’s sad, but a lot less drama to just leave things be.
it’s worth noting that frequently, people with alzheimer’s don’t really remember how long you visited for, but they remember it almost like a binary. Did she visit recently, yes or no. 

You get more mileage with her by visiting for multiple times a week and leaving after 30 minutes, compared to just visiting once a week and hours of her being mad and yelling at you and begging you not to leave, and then feels abandoned for a whole week.
It sounds like the change of scenery is disorienting to her.  My recommendation would be to have your normal Christmas morning without her there, but then visit later with gifts for her.  Gifts can be very simple, like slipper-socks with grips on the bottom, a new nightgown, etc.
The one piece of advice that I received from everyone when my mom first went into memory care is to not take her out, because she will not want to go back.  Given the history here, I would not bring her home for Christmas.  It's hard not to feel guilty, I know, but it's really for the best.  My mother has dementia & is in memory care, but my MIL is also struggling with Alzheimer's and is at home - and sometimes my 16 yo daughter gets upset that my MIL is struggling, so I get it.  My brother is not involved with my mom because she alienated him early on in her dementia journey and my husband's brothers live 2 hours away, so responsibility for both falls on us for both of them.
The memory care home my mom was in held a huge Christmas party for family (this was pre-COVID though). We used to focus on that and skip having Mom come to our homes for the holidays.
bring the siblings and daughter and visit her on christmas. does the facility have a dining hall or can you take her out to a nice restaurant? don’t bring her home if it will only make everyone upset",2021-12-14 16:28:34,Hopeful-Meaning4999,rghsqb
Alzheimers,Mom's in a clinical trial now.,"I posted a comment here recently in which I mentioned my mother's upcoming neurology visit and MRI. I'm a nine-hour car ride away, so I couldn't be there for the appointments, but my stepfather tells me the doctor enrolled her in a clinical trial. He couldn't give me many specifics other than that it involved an IV medication taken monthly. According to information available on her neurologist's website, the study is for Donanemab.

Is that typical for early stage Alzheimer's? I mean, I love science, but I also want to stave this off as long as possible. I have concerns that this is because Mom and has junk insurance until she's eligible for Medicare at age 65 (July), and her plan won't cover anything else right now. I'll save my rant about US healthcare for another time.

Thank you. :)","I would say you got very lucky that your mom got enrolled in this trial. Getting the only similar treatment that is available commercially (Aduhelm) would cost huge sums of money meaning that her insurance company would do anything in its power to disqualify her as viable for the treatment.
Good for her! I have guardianship now, but the doctor referred my mom to a local study (before she moved here with me) but my stepdad never enrolled her. Now she's late stage and no longer eligible. It would have been my choice to enroll her.
It is typical for this kind of study. They’re looking to see if the plaques and tangles are either reduced or don’t grow. They’ll also evaluate her behavior. My guess is it’s free for her and they probably pay her and your stepfather for the visits. At some point they may also do a PET scan. MRI will tell them if the structure of the brain has changed. If it’s early stage, they probably won’t see anything. PET shows how the brain is functioning. I think the radioactive solution bonds with the proteins (Amyloid and Tau, I think) so they get a better image of how much is there. 

Good luck to you and your mom.
Please report back on how she’s doing.  We need a cure and relief from this terrible disease.
Call the neurologist.  This is probably her best shot to prevent progression.  Best luck and please thank your mother for her time and effort.  Without heroic subjects willing to take a risk and go for it, we will never develop medications.
I would read up on the clinical trials for Aduhelm.  I think 40% of people on the highest dose had brain swelling but lower doses were tolerated pretty well.  Please make sure they monitor her closely with MRIs if you decide to take part.
If it's a clinical trial, then by definition its not typical, but rather experimental.  It may help postpone the worst symptoms.  

What is typical is donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda).
[https://rethink-alz.com/index.html](https://rethink-alz.com/index.html) is another trial recruiting for a phase 3 trial for Cassava Sciences' Simufilam.  I believe it's pills instead of IV.",2021-12-14 07:03:08,bespectacledneurotic,rg61qt
Alzheimers,Positive experience with Aduhelm?,Dad has a mild case of Alzheimers and is considered to be a candidate for Aduhelm.  I know there is some controversy around the FDA's approval of this drug and side effects.  Can anyone advise if they know of anyone who has had a positive experience with Aduhelm?,"I am a medical student planning on specializing in Neurology. I have spent two months working with two different neurologists, and was very interested in Aduhelm due to my grandmother's Alzheimer's diagnosis. 

I discussed this medication extensively with these neurologists and also read the studies myself. 35% of patients in the studies had brain tissue swelling (cerebral edema), which is very painful and can cause permanent neurological deficits. One person died as a result of cerebral edema as a side effect of Aduhelm. The studies for Aduhelm have not shown any prevention of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. All they show is that Aduhelm can help decrease beta-amyloid plaques, which are found in brains of those with Alzheimer's. Many scientists who study Alzheimer's debate whether or not the beta-amyloid plaques are the cause of memory loss in cognitive decline in dementia. 

Neither of the neurologists I worked with were comfortable with the idea of prescribing Aduhelm to their patients.",2021-12-13 22:24:34,one_rabbit_stew,rfxxye
Alzheimers,Grandfather can’t retain my grandmothers death.,"My grandmother passed away about a week ago from her long fight with Alzheimer’s. Her and my grandfather were married for 62 years. Before her passing he would have slight hiccups in his mind (usually at night time but nothing serious). But he cannot retain the information that she has passed away. Is he subconsciously blocking it out? Every day multiple times a day he asks where she is. As his family, it becomes overwhelming and heartbreaking having to keep reminding him and see him react as if it’s his first time hearing of it. Has anyone else experienced this? Is the grief of her loss effecting his memory?","The loss of a spouse or long-time partner can definitely have this effect. This happened to my father after my mother (who had Alzheimer’s)died. I hope your grandfather lives for many more years, but sometimes they just can’t live without their loved one. Every person, and every family, is different, but sometimes a “loving lie” can help. Being reminded of her passing may just be too painful. We eventually started telling my dad that she would be back soon. 
Just be there for him as much as you can and love him while he is here. I wish the best for you and your family.
He could be subconsciously blocking it out, but it’s more likely signs of dementia. Could be that the grief and her passing accelerated it, too.

I haven’t dealt with this exactly, but family friends and people in our old support group have. You should not be reminding him that she’s passed away. It doesn’t do him any good because he won’t remember that fact a few hours from then, or even that he asked where she was. All it does is hurt him with no real benefit to him or you because you have to see that heartbreak. You can say “Oh she’s out right now/running an errand/etc. She’ll be back later.” You could say you’re not sure, and that she’ll be back soon. You’ll have to try different things and see what works, but anything is better than him reliving that heartbreak over and over. This is the advice we got from friends and family, and it’s what we did with my dad, just for other things besides a person’s passing. Like he wanted to drive somewhere but reminding him he couldn’t drive anymore would make him angry and sad, so we would tell him we would do that later, or the next day. Within a few minutes he’d forget about it.

So sorry you’re going through this, wishing you all the best.
This same exact thing happened to my papa when nana passed away. He was always asking where she was. We decided to leave her obituary on top of his daily newspaper where he drank his morning tea so he would read this first. It really helped him to understand she was gone. I hope this helps. Its a  really tough subject and I'm sure there is multiple ways for him and your family to deal with this. Good luck, Patience is key to dealing with a loved one with Alzheimer's...listening to their favorite music helps too!
My dad died in June, every morning my mother goes through the intense grief as she remembers he is gone. 

Honestly I wish she were further along, this daily horror she goes through is awful. 

It's such an ugly and terrible disease.
Tell your grandfather she's visiting friends in Paris

Alzheimers,I’m hoping to get some advice and encouragement for an upsetting family situation. I’m reporting a family member tomorrow for elder abuse.,"Almost a year ago, my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. She’s young, only 72. We drew up some durable financial POA papers, making my mother her POA and listing me as a secondary if my mother fails to perform her duties.

Around the time she was diagnosed my uncle started asking her to give him one of her twelve acres to put a mobile home on. We did a little research, realized how much she could end up losing and said no. He had a pretty big fit. My mom told him to please not ask for anything from my grandmother because with her Alzheimer’s it isn’t right. 

Over the last six months, my uncle has poisoned my grandmothers thoughts. He has convinced her that she doesn’t really have Alzheimer’s and that my mother is tricking her. He says my mother, who works in healthcare, got her “cronies” at the hospital to lie. My grandmothers Alzheimer’s has progressed so rapidly and she believes him. She’s very angry with my mother and has even created more paranoid ideas about her. 

Friday night, my mother went to visit my grandmother and check on things. She does this every Friday and arranges her medicine. My grandmother told her that my uncle took her to the mobile home place and she signed the papers. Mom blew up and my granny told her to get out. She told her she knows she’s tricking her, she doesn’t have Alzheimer’s and she doesn’t want anything to do with her. She said my uncle took her to see “a man” who changed it so that he will get everything when she is gone, and mom will get nothing. 

My mother says she is done. She is very stressed out and doesn’t want to be responsible for her anymore. I wish that was not the case, but I also understand that she is overwhelmed. I told her that I will take over now. 

So here is my plan. Please tell me if I am doing the right thing. And if you have any wisdom please share it. 

Tomorrow morning I am reporting my uncle for elder abuse. I am calling the mobile home business as well to notify them that she has Alzheimer’s and they cannot move forward. I will also call and make an appointment with an elder law attorney. I need the attorney to either remove my mother and make me the primary POA, or ask a judge to choose a conservator for my grandmother. 

Is there anything I am missing? Does that all sound correct to you? I just want to make sure she is taken care of. She is so young and I’m afraid we could have a very long road ahead. I live 2 hours away and just had a baby 3 months ago (who despises car rides) so I can’t be with her right now. I’m hoping that when the time comes for her to need full time care (which seems to be drawing near) maybe I can get her into a nice assisted living facility where I live so I can look after her and be with her. I’m scared for her. 

Also, I know that reporting my uncle has to be the right thing to do, but I’m worried that she will not be allowed to talk to him anymore. That would be devastating for her. He is an absolute monster for doing this, but she loves him and I’m afraid she won’t understand.

Any advice or encouragement would be so appreciated.","Sometimes this is the only way to protect them from themselves. I am moms primary caregiver and have been for almost four years. I have 5 older siblings that took advantage of her financially for years. They left her with no retirement or savings. Since I have taken over her finances and stopped giving them her money they have basically abandoned her. When your grandmother made the decision to make your mother POA and not him I’m assuming she still had all her faculties and knew she could trust her to not take advantage of her. Your uncle had no right to go behind your mothers back and take advantage of your grandmothers failing health. You are doing the right thing.
You might want to have a lawyer write up the letter for the mobile home company & whoever your uncle got to redo her will. They likely aren't the most honest guys in the industry & if you start out being nice about it, they are likely going to either take the money & run or give you some BS runaround. If you lead with a forceful lawyer letter informing them that they may be party to criminal fraud & charges are pending against the uncle (regardless of what you decide to pursue on that front) they will likely get them to drop him & any money they were going to get like a hot potato - saving you time and hassle and stress in the meantime.

We had one incident where an HVAC salesman convinced mom she needed 18k worth of work on a 2yo AC. He'd done a ""free home assessment"" and she'd signed all the paperwork. We only found out about it because she'd mentioned the work was starting the next day. My brother snapped into legal mode & scared the living daylights out of the HVAC company. They backed right down and refunded everything. 

As for limiting her access to the uncle, that's a much harder thing. If you scare him enough with the legal charges, you might be able to reset the expectations & conditions around which he can have access (e.g. drop pressing charges as long as he apologizes and explains to your grandmother what he did). But he sounds like the kind of guy who will disappear out of her life on his own if he doesn't stand to profit from it. You have an obligation to preserve her assets for her care & that needs to be your guiding principle from here on out - if he can't be trusted to respect that, he needs to go.
You are doing the right thing.  He is mentally abusing her, and is possibly financially abusing her.
I’m new to this myself. Have you talked with her doctor to get a letter stating her dementia? This may help to negate what your relative has done Since she doesn’t understand or comprehend what she is doing.
You might consider posting to r/legaladvice
Was the POA not finalised?
Been there. Done that.

What a creep.

Definitely see an elder law attorney. You can find a certified one on nelf.org

What you may be missing is a letter from her doctor stating the diagnosis AND that she does not have the capacity to make financial decisions.  Read the POA. It might say that your Mom just needs to resign in order for you to step up as the successor. However, your uncle may have also had ""the man"" draw up a new POA which would make your POA invalid. If ""the man"" is an attorney, it's up to his discretion to determine if your grandmother has testamentary capacity (the cognitive ability to make a new will and POAs etc.). The attorney's license is on the line, so you can bet that the attorney will say she definitely had the cognitive capacity. In this case, you may have to litigate and have proof if you want to fight the changes (very expensive and no guarantee of success).

Guardianship/Conservatorship is not as easy as just asking the judge to appoint someone. The process can take up to a year and cost $10,000. But it may come to that. There are emergency conservatorship options that could initially get someone appointed faster until everything is finalized. The elder law attorney will help you with this if appropriate. This would have no impact on the new will.

I'm really sorry you and your Mom are in this situation. I know from experience how upsetting and stressful it is. It made me feel powerless and vulnerable for a while. Someone that would do this is the same person that will neglect to take good care of your grandmother - which is very scary.
Yes, an attorney is vital. With court situations, changing the POA, and getting a restraining order (or some sort of legal help) on the uncle, a lawyer will be essential and will enable you to find the best path to protecting her and her assets. You want the court to oversee assets so you can have accountability become about the court and not the guardian, perhaps. 

And once there's no money left to sniff for, the family may disappear. There's no inheritance from my mother now, only bills. It's easy to run out an entire estate rather quickly with the cost of Alzheimer's care.
At 72 she might last 10 years.    If she goes into a home... she might have to sell that land anyway to afford it. ...

I feel for you my mom started showing signs of dementia at 71 years old. She just turned 87 last week and has been confined to a bed for a little over a year now. She started getting to late stage Alzheimer's about 5 years ago and then forgot about me, her only son, about 3 years ago and does not appear now she will last much longer into next year. It's a brutal disease to the victim and the family caregivers involved. I got legal conservatorship 5 years ago and decided to quit working 1 1/2 years after that to care for her. It's been total care since then and luckily we had the financial resources to make it happen, so others may not have had the same options. Good luck to you and all the best with this journey. Sounds like you are doing the right thing by her thus far.

Alzheimers,Phone issues,"My grandpa has been getting worse recently and calls me all hours of the day. It has gotten worse recently and my schedule is pretty packed with my masters program, internship, and work. He calls me any hour of the day or night and it disrupts my sleep as well. I feel bad for not being able to talk but I’ve explained my schedule multiple times and he has my schedule next to his calendar. Is there any way to help this?

Thanks in advance.","It's going to sound terrible, but stop answering the phone.  I had to do that with my mom,  because every time she'd call it was ""Get me out of here or I'm going to disown you"" (she lives in a memory care unit).  Turn off your ringer or put your phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" while you are sleeping or doing important schoolwork.
Turn off your phone during the hours you want to get sleep.  In other words, take control of it yourself, rather than expecting him to do so.
My mom would call me without realizing it at weird hours of the night. And I would be in the next room over. I think she was just fiddling with her phone. Not sure if your gpa is doing the same or he’s purposely calling you.
My dad was doing this to me right around the time we had to get him an at home caregiver. Does he live with anyone?
Is your Grandpa using a cell phone or landline phone? You might checkout teleCalm’s quiet hours and repeat dialing features to see if that would help.",2021-12-12 21:58:45,stragglebabble,rf5e0z
Alzheimers,Does this sound like early-onset Alzheimer’s? My aunt has some concerning new behavior. Wondering if these examples sound like your experience with Alzheimer’s,"My aunt has had a dramatic personality change in the last 5 years. She’s 59, no medical history besides depression (on an SSRI), college-educated, works in consulting, and lived an upper middle class lifestyle while raising 3 kids with her husband. About 5 years ago, she divorced my uncle stating she wasn’t in love with him anymore. Their family has lived several states away my entire life but about a year ago, she impulsively decided to move back to her home state (where I live as well as the rest of our extended family). As such, I’ve been spending much more time with her. Here are some weird things I’ve noticed: 

- horrible with finances, bought a nice home here that she cannot afford payments on, can’t afford car payments, talks about waiting for payday very often. She is still working as a consultant
- two separate car accidents within a year. Both single-vehicle incidents and involved crashing into the median. Couldn’t provide her location to a family member after the first accident but she was on a common highway and should’ve known where she was. First crash totaled her car, second resulted in needing all new tires 
- doesn’t remember the names of two cats she adopted a year ago. Each time they’re brought up she gives different names. It is not an act and she is not concerned about this 
- obsessed with dating. On every dating website and spends an excessive amount of time on them. Romanticizes every interaction she has with men (including mailman, security system repair man)
- doesn’t speak much when in a group. Almost seems like she’s having trouble following the conversation 
- her home is very messy, her dog is always so dirty and smelly 
- overall aloof and has expressed no concern about any of these situations, talking with her always just seems off 

All of these examples are out of character for her. I’m in med school so have brought up my concerns to my parents. Her paternal grandma had typical Alzheimer’s but mom is healthy at 81, dad was killed at age 42. She also has a 24 y/o son with Bipolar II. I’m particularly worried about her lack of awareness of the issues. It seems like early-onset Alzheimer’s to me but looking for outside input. Does this behavior remind you of your experience? Any other signs I should look for? Would love to hear anyone’s thoughts.","Could be, but could also be other things.  Maybe she has a drinking problem you don't know about (which she probably wouldn't be broadcasting).  Maybe the depression isn't adequately treated.  Maybe she has sleep apnea.  Etc.

I think it's right to mention to your parents, but I'd leave it to them for further action.  Do your aunt's kids live in her current location?  They would be another logical place to mention concerns.  Your aunt's ex should not have any role since they are divorced.
Bring her to someone who knows what they are doing. Sounds more like FTD.
This description is more fitting for bvFTD.  The major behavioral changes, impulsivity, and disinhibition are classic signs.  However, psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder can mimic FTD extremely well.

A neurologist specializing in memory and neuropsychological testing w/ a neuropsychologist would be beneficial in figuring out what going on.  A frontal lobe tumor could also cause these symptoms but this is rarer.
I would have her children address this immediately. If she’s dating on line she could be sending her money to a scammer, especially if she’s struggling with dementia and depression. This might explain her financial behavior. Not taking hygienic care can also be a sign of either. She definitely shouldn’t be in control of her finances and driving if dementia or Alzheimer’s is involved.
Start the ball rolling by **getting her to her primary care physician** for a wellness check. The doctor will give some simple tests. Based on these results a referral to a psychologist or other specialist may be made.  This is just a start and it is not a easy road. Good luck to you.
This sounds more hormonal, possibly due to menopause? Either way, urge her close family members to get her to check in with a doctor.
We are not doctors, and even a doctor cannot diagnose someone from a Reddit post.  Work with your parents to try to get her to see a doctor if you are very concerned.
All you described could very well be early onset Alzheimer’s or another form of Dementia. The lack of awareness is typical and a key point in that direction. Or, less likely but still possible, a brain tumor. A brain MRI, a PET scan, and a Neuropsych. work-up would be extremely beneficial. You’re a smart and kind person to notice and be concerned. Good luck!
I feel silly saying this to a med student (tell me to shut up if this sounds ridiculous), but it almost sounds like a hormonal imbalance or a brain tumor. As far as I know, extreme changes in sexual desire on the upswing are not a component of Alzheimer’s. 

Has she ever been a cigarette smoker? Could it be lung cancer that has metastasized to the brain? This happened to my dad and he was misdiagnosed. His behaviors had changed radically as well, much in the ways you describe. Looking for mail order brides and cheap viagra replacements. Not a prior behavior.",2021-12-12 16:28:00,medschoolisrough,reyr38
Alzheimers,Mother in Law with Alzheimers,"Hello All...

Maybe some of you can help me. My mother in law was diagnosed with Alzheimers about two years ago. She lives a couple states away from us (about a two hour plane ride), and we are her closest family geographically. She has insisted on staying in that state, and now she is enrolled in a state funded program that covers the costs of her memory care facility/all other medical expenses. At this point it would be very difficult to relocate her to our state, as she is very fragile, and would become ineligible for the program covering her costs.

She recently began to decline and went to the hospital. She had very low blood pressure, had lost a lot of weight, and doctor's think she had a stroke. She is not eating much at all, is refusing food, and is rapidly losing weight/strength. The doctor's will not put it a feeding tube as they say she is still of sound mind and can make her own choices. My husband panicked and flew to see her in the hospital and has been successful getting her to eat some bites of things. He is afraid that if he leaves, she will stop eating again. At this point, he is willing to fly to her every few days to feed her, but this is not sustainable for us. Flying is very expensive, and we have young kids, and no help nearby. I know he wants to make sure he does everything in his power to help his mom survive as long as possible, but I'm not sure what to do about this. Anyone have thoughts/suggestions?","She’s dying. It’s her time, and a lack of appetite is normal. Please encourage your husband to face the inevitable and pursue counseling or a support group to help him deal with the loss.
It sounds like the program she is in is the best of all possible worlds. The thing is, she may be coherent enough to realize she is declining and she wants to be done. There is no mercy in keeping someone alive past the point where they don’t want to be here anymore.

Maybe the kindest thing that can happen, both for your husband and your MIL, is for him to plan to say his goodbyes. He should get some counseling ASAP, as it sounds like he is in a difficult state of mind and has not accepted the inevitability of what is happening. Humans are not that much different from other animals—when someone stops eating, they are trying to shut the body down so that their spirit can move on to the next plane of existence. 

I am so sorry. I know as a spouse it must be so difficult to watch your husband struggle through this. Feelings of helplessness tend to run rampant for everyone involved. Do what you can to bolster him, and get counseling for yourself as well if you feel you need it. And we’re here to listen when you need to talk.
When you visit, take LOADS of cakes for them to enjoy their time together. In the moment. There will always be a last time.

Grandmas mum, we had a tinned fruit salad pudding with evaporated milk. She gave me a blue glass elephant when I left.
Grandads mum, got annoyed at me in her wheelchair as I accidentally got out of the lift on the wrong floor in her home. But did enjoy how fast I pushed her down the corridors.
Dads dad, he told me how to say different puddings in pig Latin.
Dads mum, we talked about how she really liked the guy who did her laundry.
Mums dad, we talked about tax on Cornish Pasties.
She’s not dying because she’s not eating. She is not eating *because she is dying*. When someone is dying naturally, their brain stops sending signals that makes them feel hungry. Force-feeding her would be torture, arguably. Have husband fly to her to visit, but just try to enjoy time together, don’t try to force her to eat.
My mom had undiagnosed cancer, she had no ability to tell us she was that sick.  She’d had multiple doctor appointments, but hadn’t had blood work in a number of months, we just didn’t know.  10 years later we still feel horrible about not knowing and helping her if she was in pain.  See if the docs will do some blood work.  At least that would ease your mind about cancer or some other disease that she may have.  As the other person said, it just might be her time.  Deepest sympathy for your family and MIL.
I’m so sorry to read of your predicament 🙏
Your husband should take the flight to see his mom; it will provide better closure for him to see where she is and talk to her health care providers and hold her (one last time?)
It’s a sad and scary time. You can support him by letting him know that you will be home waiting for him and taking care of your kids ♥️
Blessings and good vibes to you 🙏",2021-12-12 02:05:35,asmartermartyr,rejhzr
Alzheimers,Mom keeps falling in the night,"My mom just moved to memory care from assisted living a week ago. We set up her room, tried to make it homey. For the last 5 nights, my mom has had falls trying to get out of bed in the middle of the night. EMS has been called. We went to the ER one night. All labs were normal and the CT scans showed no trauma. The problem is it keeps happening and I’m worried she’s going to break something. She goes to bed way too early, like 5 pm. I’ve asked the staff to try to keep her up, but they said they can’t stop her from going to bed early? They recommended a hospital bed. Does that help? I got no slip socks but she won’t keep them on. Got her a no slip fall mat too. Her primary care doctor has not been helpful. Still waiting to hear back from her memory care doctor. Has anyone else had this issue? Any recommendations or ideas?","Do you know why she is trying to get up? Does she need to go to the bathroom, is she searching for someone or something? Try to figure out if there is a reason she is up. Many dementia patients are restless and wander at night. But if there is a specific reason, you can work to prevent the need to search. 

Looking for family? Put pictures on the bedside table. If she is still able to comprehend what she reads, write out a note explaining where she is and when you will come visit next. If she is getting up to go the bathroom, what about a walker next to the bed or a bedside commode just at night. If she is getting up to wander because she is restless, a hospital bed may be the best choice. 

One more thing. Are there night lights in her room? Dementia patients tend to have significant trouble seeing in lower light/the dark. If she prefers to sleep in a very dark room, you could look at the night lights that are motion sensor.
A memory care facility should have a handle on dealing with falls. Falls can happen for a number of reasons. My mom falls because she has lost her ability to balance herself. She has to use a walker in order to remain steady. Your mom could be at that point. I would think the physicians there at the memory care facility would be able to do an assessment on her to determine her needs…?
My gran fell twice going to the bathroom in the night about a week apart. Split her head both times. I’ve been doing two things suggested by the nurse.
1) giving her a reminder lesson on walking properly every day to the other side of the room and back (pick up your knees, put weight from heel to toe, don’t shuffle).
2) put high contrast tape on everything she could potentially trip on. (Door sills, edges of rugs etc).
Hope one of those helps.
https://i.imgur.com/nbDm5KZ.jpg
If she's up to go to the bathroom, a bedside commode could be helpful.  Also,is there adequate light in the room?  I'm a fan of touch lamps.  You can have one on a nightstand and it is extremely easy to turn one on, no need to fumble for a switch.

ETA:  possibly staff could take her to the toilet at 8:30 or so, so there would be less need for a bathroom trip.
Thanks for these tips. We removed some of her furniture today to try to make more space for walker. Added a footboard to her bed to decrease the amount of bed she can sit on. 
We had a long talk with the memory care  manager. She doesn’t think it is one particular reason she is getting up (ie bathroom, packing, etc). They are going to encourage her to stay up longer. I like asking the staff to take her to the restroom at a certain time. We added night lights. The contrast tape may be a good idea too. We are all working on her to use the walker all the time. I emailed her memory care doctor for some more info on sleep aids like melatonin and physical therapy. Thank you all for the input and suggestions! I really appreciate it!!",2021-12-12 04:21:36,PiperE93,relfxz

Alzheimers,Trying to get grandma to eat. Made her exactly what she wanted for dinner. She’s refused all of it.,,"Hard to remember sometimes when things get really frustrating, but it’s the disease—it’s not her.

See if she wants ice cream. Anything at all that she will eat. It’s difficult, and it sucks. But if you can get her to eat anything at all, that’s a win. Hope you find something.

For me, walking away for a few minutes and practicing deep breathing has been a lifesaver. ;-)
Such a familiar battle.  My husband died from Alzheimer’s.  The number of times meals went uneaten were uncountable.  Tried homemade, frozen meals,delivery, favorite foods, replacement drinks, ice cream for any meal etc. the nutritionalist basically had me feed any meal and add a tablespoon of avocado oil (basically tasteless) to any meal or shake to add calories.  It’s a fine line and not a fun one.  He was so skinny.
I try to sneak extra calories at every opportunity. I add cereal to her bowl in the morning and blueberries & strawberries. I switched to a high protein full fat milk from 1%. 

I add potato chips with a sandwich. I use slider buns instead of bread, and butter or mayonnaise. Whole wheat crackers with spreadable cheese or peanut butter. 

When shopping I buy the high calorie version. Candy is calories. 

Try to serve different desserts: pies, cookies cakes, pumpkin roll in the evening. I suggest a dessert earlier, than get it ready about 1/2 hour later. Don't forget whipped cream on top. Every calorie matters.
Start small and simple, this is what I learned with my mom and was the only way I could get her to eat. Applesauce or brown sugar oatmeal first and the rest of the meal after 5-10min. 

Applesauce is also a good vessel for crushed up medication.",2021-12-10 15:14:09,Bolehillbilly,rdhgsp
Alzheimers,Gift Idea,"Hi there.

I'm wanting to get opinions on a gift idea for my MIL who has been diagnosed with Alzheimers. She currently lives about a thousand miles away from my family and my spouse is her only child. Her birthday is a few days before christmas, so I was considering making a special album for her with pictures and descriptions of everyone. It will include current pictures of our family (with her two grandkids) as well as some other pictures that my spouse has from childhood.

No such thing, well done.
My wife and I say it's like having a toddler again. They can be up to something potentially harmful in a blink. Keeping an eye on them, even near constantly isn't a bad thing. Especially if your loved one is prone to mischief.
You're not being overprotective but there may be a stage where your loved one becomes afraid of reflections and you may need to put them away or cover them because it causes them too much distress.
No you are being Just-Right protective.

Alzheimers,How to stop running,"My father in law has a tendency to take off as soon as my mother in law leaves the room.  He's 80, alzheimer's diagnosis was 8 years ago.

Is the a way to keep him in his chair when she needs to use the bathroom?  Something like a seat belt for a recliner.","We simplified our house when my dad was super roamy. This way he wouldn't get as much stuff.

But to keep him occupied while my mom was busy doing other stuff we had a standing tv table that had various stuff for him. Use to be magazines, pictures things to stack and then fiddle toys or toddler toys.  We would make sure his fav cowboy shows were on and that normally held his attention. 

One thing that helped immensely were those cheap alarms on the doors going out and to the garage. That way we would know when he would open the door. We also put that cheap slide locks at the base of the door we could slide with our toe and he never noticed it. 

We also made sure that we got him plenty of physical activity. Taking walks outside when the weather is nice or walking around the house and throwing a lightweight ball back and forth.

Hope this helps!
If you must restrain him, a gait belt and a wheel chair are pretty good tools for that. I just put it loosely around my grandpas abdominal and let it lay where it falls but the handles.  Then cover him up, give him a snack or drink, and turn on the TV for him while my grandma showers or cooks.
We don't live there so we have only so much say.

We put the alarm on the door but my mother in law didn't like it so she took out the batteries.  He has bed alarm but no alarm in the chair.  Problem is he is very weak and has no leg muscle, until he suddenly is strong and can walk unassisted.   It happen twice today.  First time he made it to a chair, the second time the strength left and he fell.

We try to convince her to follow the directions from the doctor but she thinks she knows better.
This morning he fell for the second time in 6 days.",2021-12-06 18:03:50,Nude-genealogist,rakcia

from the article:

 

“Sildenafil, which has been shown to significantly improve cognition and memory in preclinical models, presented as the best drug candidate,” said Dr Feixiong Cheng, the study lead. Viagra is the brand name of sildenafil.

Researchers then used a database of claims from more than 7 million people in the US to examine the relationship between sildenafil and Alzheimer’s disease outcomes by comparing sildenafil users to non-users.

They found sildenafil users were 69% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than non-sildenafil users after six years of follow-up.""

and later they caution:

 “Importantly, this research doesn’t prove that sildenafil is responsible for reducing dementia risk, or that it slows or stops the disease. The only way to test this would be in a large-scale clinical trial measuring sildenafil effect against the usual standard of care.”

In more than 3,000 participants 65 years old and older, 853 developed dementia, with 709 cases of Alzheimer's disease, the data showed.

Approximately half of the participants had cataract surgery, and those who had the procedure in either eye were about 30% less likely to develop any form of dementia over at least the next 10 years, the researchers said.

Vision loss has been associated with an increased risk for all forms of dementia, due at least in part to its effect on independence and quality of life, so surgery to correct it may help keep older adults active and mentally engaged, according to the researchers.",,2021-12-06 15:47:33,daiken77,rahavq

Alzheimers,My grandpa refuses to pay for additional help for my grandmother with Alzheimer’s and it’s killing them both.,"I just wanted to rant because I’m so frustrated and angry at my grandfather. He is 91 years old and has bragged (after a few drinks) that he has managed to acquire a million dollars through saving and investments. My grandmother is mid-late stage at 88 years old. They still live alone. My parents and aunt worked to get a part time caretaker and he didn’t give her any tasks to do and refused to bring in another caretaker. 

We found assisted living and memory care facilities they could go together. My grandmother fell about a month ago and had to be in the hospital for 6 days. She is becoming incontinent, and she cannot walk without a lot of help. She rarely remembers anything that happened five minutes before. They only eat okay because the rest of the family brings prepared meals they can reheat. They sit and watch movies all day in a dark room. A healthy young person is incapable of providing all the care she needs, let alone a 91 year old man. He CAN AFFORD BETTER and chooses not to so he can pass on an inheritance to his children who have been getting by without his money for years just fine. I am horrified watching him mistreat his wife of over 60 years when he could easily afford the care she needs to live out her remaining years with some semblance of dignity. 

I’ve talked to him about it repeatedly, sent other resources, got other opinions, and he just says he’ll take it into consideration and does nothing. I call them both to chat multiple times a week but I live halfway across the country and it feels so hopeless knowing there is nothing else I can do to help my grandma.","Your story sounds like how my father caring for my mother. My father has investments and savings in excess on 3 million US dollars and he refused to support proper care or any help for her. My sister and we're really concerned so we called his county senior services (New York). County agents came to visit his house and saw how my mother was neglected. They gave my father 30 days to place my mother in dementia nursing home.
You are most likely in the US.. can you report it as abuse to some authority.. I'm not sure how it works there.. I'm sure my parents would be in the same situation if my father had his full facilities.  I have financial authority for my father so I make sure all my mother's health needs are taken care of.  They both have dementia. My mother has Alzheimer's.  Are there perhaps signs grandfather is also suffering from some kind of dementia?  Is failure to to provide heath care is something that can be be dealt with?  I'm so sorry you are going through that.
That sounds painful and frustrating. 😔
Call APS and make a report. It will be anonymous and they will send a social worker to pay your grandparents a visit and asses the situation and intervene if necessary. Even if they can’t force intervention sometimes a blunt conversation about reality with a professional is enough to convince an elder of what needs to be done.
You can't be sure that she would be happier and better off in assisted living.  She may prefer her familiar surroundings with her lifetime partner.  She certainly could fall, could become incontinent too, in residential care.  As for Gramps, his lifetime habit of frugality is second nature to him now, when he probably has intellectual difficulty with decision-making and change.

Providing meals as your family have been doing is a huge help.  Regular contact and supervision is very helpful.  At some point the decision will be taken away from them, often after a fall or other big event that lands one in the hospital.  

It's really hard to respect people's autonomy when you see they could be doing better by giving some of it up.  But always remember that this is what you are asking of them.  Good luck with a difficult situation.
As a social worker, I often find in these situations that the primary caregiver spouse is experiencing cognitive decline themselves which causes them to be very rigid in their thinking and actions. Some of the examples you've given about house upkeep and meal preparation could signal that. Sometimes using ""dementia friendly"" communication with the primary cg elder spouse is helpful in these situations: i.e. not rationalizing or reasoning, not expecting him to agree to something he doesn't understand, or not expecting him to be able to follow through with complex multistep tasks. Communicating on an emotional level is also helpful: ""This disease is so hard and you've taken care of grandma so well.  It's so hard for me to see you in this situation and I want to help."" Great idea to reach out to local agencies for free support - your local area agency on aging should have a caregiver support program to tap into. Sometimes hearing recommendations from a physician or other professional makes all the difference. You are doing a great job advocating for them - take care of yourself!
My husband had to call adult protective services because his father would not get any care for his mother or even communicate about anything properly. His mother had a part time nurse in the house very soon afterwards. Of course everyone would have preferred even more care for her since he only provided the bare minimum necessary. But it was the solution he was able to come to of his own volition since trying to have input in her care was impossible. 
I'm not sure APS even forced him to do anything, it was just what helped him finally face reality and losen his wallet in the situation.
Hmm... So others might not agree with me here but.. A million dollars can and will get wiped out by paying for care facilities.  He could spend down all his money, and then he'd truly be dependent on extended family for help. That he didn't assign tasks to help when it was already available and paid for did make me think he is a proud man, possibly in a detrimental way. But the problems shes having alone don't necessarily look like abuse to me? It could be, but not sure, if he is responsive to acute situations. 

What are the opinions of the other family members who he has regular contact with? Do they also find him to be abusive and neglectful? Does he have a history of this predating her diagnoses? 

The reason I am cautious about a ""hes abusing her"" bandwagon is that often times even well meaning family have opinions about what the primary caregiver ""should"" be doing without really knowing all the moving parts. In general, I think its a good idea to support the primary caregiver with whatever direction they want to go in. The situation, and indeed his feelings about the consequences of his actions, could easily be more complex than he is sharing. 

But it *is* absolutely possible that caregivers hang on for longer than is good for them, or the person they are caring for. Usually I would blame the nature of the disease though, because it can be so slow moving. Its like that slow boiling a frog analogy. They may have a hard time realizing until its too late. 

If his goal is to have money to pass on to his kids, you could suggest to him to consult a financial planner for elderly. They might suggest to him ways he can pass money on to his kids (such as by annual gifts), that may (if its not too late) put him in a position to get other benefits from medicaid or medicare. There may also be free resources or volunteer services he could make use of..maybe hed be less resistant if its free? Maybe it would even help ease him into the idea of accepting outside help? 

I don't know. I know its a tough situation and im sure theres more to the situation. I may be a little predisposed to side with the primary caregiver. But in any case its great you care and want to help. I hope you find a solution, that works for your whole family, good luck!
This sounds like how my mother in law treats my father in law.  As long as it's free from the VA she'll take the help.  They have the money to get help or get him in memory care but she refuses to get it

He fell 2 hours ago, fire got him back to his hospital bed bit she still won't get help.
This breaks my heart and makes me angry at the same time!  I would give anything to have just a portion of that amount to help my mom.  She is 93, mid-late stage Alzheimer’s and my sister (75) lives with mom and I am nearby. It is all we can do between the two of us to take care of her.  The house needs work and there simply is no money for outside help or to make repairs to the house.  My mom is on hospice, but they do not provide any real, practical help to us.  They say money doesn’t buy happiness and maybe it doesn’t, but it could sure provide some peace of mind, some practical help, and some comfort for us.  I cannot understand why anyone would have the ability to get the help and then not do it!",2021-12-04 15:39:39,uncertainegg3,r8ykyy
Alzheimers,dunno if this 'cross posting' is allowed but.. yeah..,,"This was one of my biggest fears untill my MIL convinced herself she was disabled then ""forgot"" how to walk.
Aww thank heavens for that man
Seeing things like this makes me angry. Why was she by herself?  It's so frustrating to see people with Alzheimer's being left alone. 

It wasn't like she quickly slipped away, no one was at the door to meet the Amazon driver.
breaks my heart how confused she looks...

That look of bewilderment is so sad.",2021-12-04 11:01:16,nuttyNougatty,r8smvs
Alzheimers,Anyone grow up with a parent with alz?,"Just wondering- anyone have a parent diagnosed when they were a young child? And had to live with them during the progression of their Illness?

My dad was diagnosed when I was in the 5th grade. Rapidly declined while I was in 6-8 grade and lived at home. Put in nursing home 9th grade. Died in 10th grade. I am 33 years old now and just now learning how this trauma has affected me in to adulthood. Living with a parent that was sick in the way he was was horrible. Wondering if anyone else experienced this? Most stuff I see is young kids with a grandparent with alz.","I had a grandparent when we were young, but we were super close to her. I didn't really understand what was going on but it messed me up to watch the progression.

My mom has it now and it's arguably fucking me up even more bc I know fully well what's gonna happen. Her not knowing my brothers youngest kids age, thinking a family friend died of covid when she literally talked to the friend about her catching covid the previous day, thinking I live in a state I haven't lived in for a decade, and knowing what my dad is going through.
I was not as young as you but I was in 8th grade when I started to suspect that something might be wrong with my father. His memory declined and it affected my teens quite a bit. He got the final diagnosis when I was about 21 so it progressed very slow in our case, and he is still, ~6 years later, living at home. Today he is more obviously sick though and we are looking into care-options that works at home.

It is still something that has affected me a lot. To deal with a sick dying parent who slowly changes from who he used to be when you're still a kid is obviously not a walk in the park. He has had this for half my life. 

I am in a really good support group for people who are young and who are dealing with this. Maybe you can find something similar? I found mine through my fathers hospital. Even if your parent is dead there is still a trauma and to talk with others helps a lot.
My dad got his official diagnosis when I was 30, but I swear to god I saw the signs when I was 18

Edit to say I’m so so sorry you had to go through the worst of it in your early years. I 1000% feel you. I’m just now at 35 living through the horrors of unmanaged Alzheimer’s and I can already tell that I’m gonna need a lot of therapy from this. I feel I’m too young to have to deal with losing a parent this way and I cannot imagine how difficult it was for you as a kid and still is while you to process it now.
My dad was diagnosed when i was about 14, and he was already advanced. They said they probably could have diagnosed him a couple years prior, when i was 12 or so. 

At the time, I read that life expectancy after diagnosis was something like 10 years, but my dad was already ""advanced,"" so I thought there was a chance he'd die before I graduated. He lived for nearly 20 years with it. He was one of those really angry paranoid Alzheimer's people and thought I was hiding things or that people were trying to kill him or me. He had war time flashbacks mixed in with his Alzheimer's. I mean my dad would ransack my room several times a day and be interrogating me when im trying to do math homework. He thought I was going to get sniped on the way to school. When I left for college I got told every year that he didn't have long to live, so I better come home soon (i got a little numb to this after a couple years).  I also flinched when he, or anyone else touched me ( mundane stuff like putting a hand on my shoulder) because when he had Alzheimer's and was more mobile he had a phase where would always pet my head or shoulders kind of roughly like a dad with a young son after a ballgame or something. It didnt hurt but it was *a lot* and had no context except for the Alzheimer's, so I hated it. I had recurring nightmares about him too, from hs up until shortly after he died.

I also only started recognizing that what happened counts as ""traumatic,"" when I was in my 30s too. I realized something was wrong when I was asked about my dad in HS and found I had almost no memories of him from HS and later, but my memories of him from when I was in elementary school were fine.  I had all these things but never put it together.  Then when I got a ptsd diagnosis it made sense and I realized they were connected. Now days, its hard to put the subject down. Its why I'm still on this sub, even though my dad died 10 years ago. :p
Alzheimer’s is caused by brain cells dying, so the brain doesn’t work well. It changes how the person acts. This can be upsetting or confusing for you and other family members. That’s why it’s important to learn ways to cope with changing behaviors and feelings. The journey will be both rewarding and challenging, but there are new coping strategies that can bring better times for everyone.",2021-12-04 10:14:55,AdAny4473,r8rosg

Alzheimers,"Awkward hygiene issue, need helpful tips, creative solutions","My mom has Alzheimer’s and it’s reached the point of delusions and hygiene issues. Getting her to bathe or put on new under wear is difficult because she is uncomfortable undressing, especially in front of my dad who is her primary caretaker and he’s at a loss. She seems to think men are coming into the house and stealing her underwear and laughing at her her but she keeps hiding it or throwing it away. She can’t be convinced otherwise and trying to reassure her doesn’t work either. So beyond buying new underwear every couple of weeks I don’t know what to do. I wash her hair in the sink and use wipes for her underarms. I can convince her to get in the tub maybe twice a week but she won’t wash her hair or clean herself just sit there. 

I’ve considered the disposable adult underwear because she does have some incontinence issues but won’t use her pads anymore cause she thinks “the guys will laugh at her.” 

Any hygiene or delusions tips would be great this is a new stage I’m struggling with 

Sorry if this isn’t the right space for this question, I just love my mom and want to maintain her dignity and cleanliness for as long as possible.

Edit: also going to talk to her doctors about antipsychotics or I’ve read good things about Nuplazid/Pimavanserin for the the delusions, studies are promising there. I’ll comment back if any progress there","My sister or I would get in the shower with my mom. It was big enough. No, we were in shorts and t-shirt. We turned up the heat in the bathroom 15 minutes before we planned to shower. We used a shower chair as mom was unsteady. The hand held shower head was wonderful. Mom was always feeling cold, even in the summer, so once we got her in she enjoyed the warm water. I encouraged her to shampoo herself and wash between her legs. I did the rest. Once in awhile there was just no convincing her to get in so, no shower that day. A few times we just had to tell her she stunk. She still had her pride so that often did the trick. 

Once out of the shower we turned it into a day at the spa... Blow dry and brush her hair, clean or clip her nails, lotion on her legs and feet. She loved that part. She just about cooed and purred. Clean fresh smelling clothes and afterward there was always a treat - tea and cookies. A glass of wine for sis and I.

When I was in nursing school a million years ago, I did a rotation at a nursing home. Almost all the women residents objected to taking a shower. The staff thought it was partly their modesty but also a feeling of vulnerability - fear. One of the solutions was not a bed bath per se, but bath blankets. The resident stayed in bed, covered by a sheet. Warm moist bath blankets - lightweight cotton blankets - are brought in and covered the patient while the sheet was removed. The moist blanket was massaged over the resident's body, cleaning as we went. They love it - warmth and a massage. Hair was shampooed over a shampoo tray.

Any way you look at it, cleaning a frightened resistant person is WORK. We all deserve a glass of wine afterward.
If getting your mother into a shower/bath is difficult, try no-rinse shampoo/body wash. I use Nilaqua. It has been a lifesaver for us. You just rub it on and towel off. You don't need water.
I could have written your post. We just got my mom to try Depends, and that was only because I got the fancy ones (silhouettes? Something like that). And that’s been a trial, because she does wear them, but isn’t yet convinced she needs to change them. And she tries to put them in the dryer with her other clothes to make them warm. 
For the bath, we got her a shower seat, and my dad installed a hand held shower. We told her that her hairstylist had told us about a special trick that would make her hair look like it was styled a certain way, and so she lets me wash her hair for her and I spray off the rest of her too. She won’t let my dad do that yet, and I can’t visit very often… but at least it’s a start. Totally watching this post for other ideas! Good luck!
Witch hazel wipes are great in between baths. Go on YouTube and check out Teepa Snow videos on bathing GREAT tips in there. Whenever my LO complains about any body aches I say - the doctor said a warm bath with Epsom salt helps with that. Sometimes it works.
My mom hates showers. She is unsteady on her feet and uses a walker. When it’s shower time she will say “not today, tomorrow “ or “ I don’t feel well today”.  Showering causes her anxiety level to go through the roof! Anyway, it caused me so much stress that I would only tackle the shower issue once a week, sometimes it would go to 8 or 9 days. So I ended up getting an OT authorized by her doctor and she comes twice a week. She won’t fight as much with a stranger as she does with me. If you can hire someone or if your Medicare or Medicaid will cover it, I highly recommend doing it. Makes life a lot easier as a caregiver.
In hospitals, they use bath wipes to do bed baths.  (search bath wipe)  There are also washable absorbent underwear (search absorbent underwear).  The products likely won't solve the problems, but they may be useful.
I used to do drivebys with a warm washcloth... I laugh at it now..: but she had so much dry shampoo it was caking ... her not washing was such a problem she needed to more help than we could give... it terrified her
We've recently started using Always Discreet Underwear for my grandma. She still has a lot of pride and doesn't want to wear diapers but these work wonders for her. They're pretty soft and not big and bulky, plus they're pink with little designs on them like normal underwear. She agrees to wear them most of the time but we keep a few pairs of regular underwear for the days she doesn't.

As for showers, generally we try and make a joke out of it. I'll give her a hug and sniff her and go ""Ewww you're stinky"" and then I'll sniff my shirt or under my arm and say ""Ewww I'm stinky too! We should shower/wipe ourselves down so we're not so gross"" and either she'll shower or I'll grab a wash cloth and wet it with some soap to wipe her down. Sometimes we'll do a spa day and after her shower I'll do her hair really nice or put some makeup on her to make her feel special.

My grandma is currently going through rectal cancer as well so her private areas get sore and dirty easily. To help with that a Sitz bath is amazing. It's just a little tub that goes on the toilet that fills up with hot water. It has a little hose attached that kinda works as a bidet. I highly recommend it
Can you put the pads in the briefs when she's not in the bathroom? Then they  just get slipped on, she might not even notice the pad?

Just a thought
Baby wipes warmer machine helps. Grab bars in the shower and friction mats on the floor. Detachable shower head. Bidet toilet attachment, ideally like a seat if possible. Then dad doesn't have to get up close and personal. 

Depends does have some women's underwears that are more stylish like pink and black colors. Btw we call them panties not diapers. We had to remove all my grandmother's cloth underwear and put her depends in her old underwear drawer, so she would treat them like clean undies. Still never figured out a good way getting her to stop putting her pants in the trash with the used panties though :/

You're right that this is important because UTIs are common among dementia patients especially women. And UTIs aren't just a little annoying for them. They basically make a sudden change to being crazy with severe sundowning, temper tantrums, hallucinations. Then mentally better after antibiotics. But they can injure themselves if they fall during a UTI spell.",2021-12-03 13:20:05,Magoonical,r85i8o
Alzheimers,Fear for the future,"Hi all. My dad’s mother is currently battling Alzheimer’s. It’s definitely been a challenge but we’re managing. We’re able to keep her laughing, which helps. 

My fear comes from the fact that my mother’s great grandmother had the disease, as well. With  it running on both sides of the family, I worry for my parents and their future. I also am worried about my own. 

Coping with losing the woman my grandma used to be is very difficult. It’s harder to think this could be passed on to either (or both) of my parents. This may be a very selfish way of thinking. I just really want to know if anyone has experienced these fears or has any information on the genetic side of it all?","I'm sorry to hear this. My grandmother passed away in April. She is one of 10 children. Seven of them, including my grandmother, developed ALZ. Only one of the siblings made it to adulthood and died without ever developing it. The other two died before the age of 30. Their mother (my great-grandmother) also had it.

My mother has been showing signs for a little over a year and is being formally evaluated next week. My stepfather had to take her keys away in August because she got lost driving to a friend's house. She is terrified. I am terrified for her.

To the extent I can trust a 23andMe report, I have two copies of ApoE4. I am 44. Every time I forget a word, I panic. That's attributable to age, of course, but I still worry.

Your thoughts are not selfish in the least, nor are your fears unfounded. My thoughts the last few weeks have been of how I'll take over as my mother's caregiver when my 75-year-old stepfather passes and researching ways to take care of myself so that high risk doesn't mean foregone conclusion.

I have no official information to share, except that I understand genetics are only a part of the picture. Each of my grandmother's siblings led incredibly stressful lives. My mother is an extremely high-strung worrier, someone who gets bogged down in the most unproductive stress imaginable. I have never known her to be happy, and she's completely isolated herself over the past decade. She has no friends and no longer pursues her hobbies except in the most superficial way. She sits on the couch these days and either watches TV or absentmindedly scrolls through her phone. Those are all things I've read don't help.

I don't know if it will help, but I've begun doing what I can to improve my chances of staving off ALZ—changing my diet, making sure to stay active, keeping on top of my hobbies, and letting go of what I can't control. The thought of my daughters having to consider what I'm considering now is bone-chilling. And even if nothing I do helps, it can't hurt.

You and your family are in my thoughts.
My mom and her mom both had early onset. My moms genetic test show two markers for the dominantly inherited gene, so if I got it from her it’s not if it is when. If you decide to get tested I would highly recommend a genetic counselor as many dna testing services only test for the Apoe genes not the PS-1 gene. The DIAN network has great info and resources on this. 

Also VERY important, if you do get tested and it’s positive it can potentially make you ineligible for long term care insurance UNLESS you go through a clinical research study or trial. so if you have a relative that’s already been diagnosed that’s alive, it won’t hurt to have them tested and take those result to a genetic counselor to assess your risk.",2021-12-03 01:36:09,beanqueen430,r7soxj
Alzheimers,I can never trust my mother again. She’s not my mother anymore.,"I received some very bad news today, that made me extremely sad. My mother, who it’s hard to even call her that anymore, seemed to have a moment of being able to relate on some level, and tried to comfort me. Which was nice and much needed.

The problem is, she’s not my mother anymore. All her worst characteristics have become so enormously magnified, to the point where sometimes, I feel as if I’m being gaslighted in my own home. It’s so bad, that I wonder if she is feigning frailty and a bad memory. I know how bad this sounds, trust me.

This news was confidential from a family member. I told her it was not to be discussed or repeated (I also know how stupid THAT sounds, telling someone with Swiss cheese for brains that you must or must not do anything…). If I hadn’t been so distraught, I would have never had this interaction with her. Anyone whose parent lives with them knows how hard it is to remember that this Alzheimer’s person isn’t the person that you used to know as your parent.

In the short time I had left to go to an appointment, she had called the family member to talk about this thing, breaking my trust with this family member. I do not know how to fix this. I just now know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the mother I once knew is gone forever. No more confidante, friend, or source of comfort. Just a shell with some automatic nerves firing that make her do things that make everyone a tiny bit more crazy than they would be otherwise. I apologize if I sound a little over the top. I have no other outlet for venting the pain and emotion that come from daily living this nightmare.","I care for a spouse with Alzheimer's.  Moderate stage, I'd guess.  We're at a point where there is a lot I never tell him, things I hide from him.  What helps me is two confidential outlets:  I go to a monthly caregiver support group, and I also have a monthly session with a psychologist.  Being able to unburden yourself is very beneficial.
my mom is probably past moderate alzheimers and I was struggling with this as well.  I always want or expect her to be the mom I always knew.  My therapist gave me some good advice that I basically need to mourn the loss of who my mom was because shes not here anymore.  And then get to know this new version of my mom... I don't think I've fully processed this yet but I'm working on it
It's not stupid. In mild stage, it's still her real personality with a few lapses in memory or doing something goofy but it's small. Then you reach a point of realizing it's not the same person with sharp edges a little dulled... it's a new person, who can't make choices to build trust and strengthen relationships instead of blurting out whatever
Bear in mind now that she is really is a completely different world. Words mean different things (or something nothing at all) to her. 

On a somewhat humorous note, it was really like a 50/50 that she would remember and distribute that information versus just forgetting it.",2021-12-02 23:30:09,Philosopherati,r7qfzy
Alzheimers,Who do I talk to to process my mom's Alzheimer's Disease?,"After many good conversations with family and friends, I've come to the point where condolences and a willing ear are enough for me to work through what's happening.

**Can anyone recommend how they were able to work through and process an immediate family member's decline?**

I'm 34 and I've been dealing with her decline for a few years now (which is relatively young to be watching your mom slip away).

I've realized there are some things I haven't quite worked through or gotten over regarding the situation and they're taking their toll on my life (escapism, avoidance, substance abuse, depression, guilt, resentment, indecision, etc.)

I'm willing to try whatever it takes (books, therapy, groups, whatever).

Thank you.","Honestly, what works for me is accepting it and saying, “I will focus on what they can do/ how they are now vs how they used to be.” It is all about the tiniest victories you get with them, a small smile or anything else. Good luck with everything, I am 27 and my dad has Alzheimers, it really is a pain to see them in this way…
I'm sorry you are struggling, OP. It's a terrible thing to watch a parent waste away. My dad passed on Friday from Alzheimer's; I am also your age. I don't find talk therapy very helpful but find this subreddit particularly helpful as it's people going through the same things you are. If talk therapy has helped you in the past, it might be worth pursuing again. It can sometimes take a long time to find a therapist you mesh well with. I've read several books but again, most weren't super helpful to me.
If you can find a local group meeting face to face or over zoom to chat to other caregivers supporting a loved one with Alzheimer's I've found that to be helpful. Whilst other people will listen, I've personally found those going through the same thing to be less judgemental and it feels less isolating to know they're going through similar if not exactly the same.
Therapy helped me a ton
Talk therapy helped me a lot. I also tried group therapy a bit, with a group specifically for grief/loss-related depression, but I didn’t find that as helpful. I think I was too young to relate to anyone else in the group; I was 25 at the time iirc, everyone else was like 50+, and I got in my own head about it, so that’s more on me. But I had two great therapists (moved states) that helped me come out the other side of this relatively intact.

I tried books but didn’t find it very helpful. If you have any creative hobbies, I highly recommend that. I wrote a lot of music throughout my dad’s journey, and it was really really helpful. And I didn’t intentionally sit down every day saying “I’m going to write a song about this”, I just forced myself to write and play and eventually the emotions worked their way into the music and it became really cathartic. 

Journaling was also a big help. And I wrote a lot of letters to my dad. He never read any of them. They’re just stored in text documents on my computer, or in various notebooks. But I did find it weirdly made me feel connected to the “old him”, since I was writing to the dad I remembered before the decline. About things in my life, things I was proud of or sad about, my feelings about him and the disease, etc. 

Idk, there’s no one thing that ever did the trick. Some weeks therapy wasn’t helpful, some days the writing or music just wasn’t there. Some days I’d just have to listen to some sad music or watch a sad movie and cry. For me it was about having as many tools as possible and seeing what worked in the moment.

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Sending you as many good vibes as possible, hang in there.
I haven't processed it, im just getting on with looking after her first and ill deal with the emotional fallout after she is gone. I simply have no time to deal with it on any other level right now. I do not recommend it, it is unhealthy. Sorry, I cannot help you.
Northern California Alzheimer’s association has a community resource finder with therapies and community links.
Things I have tried and their level of perceived usefulness:

* I attended a local Alzheimers caregiver support group which I found to be of moderate to low help. I would guess that your experience at a caregiver support group might depend on the population who attends. In my case there was no one anywhere near my age (40), most were spouses of elderly patients. I would still recommend trying this at least once if there is one in your area. I am planning to give it a second shot if they schedule another meeting at some point.
* I found a therapist who I see twice a month, give or take. My therapist has experience with elder care issues and have found that experience and the perspective they provide to be a pretty big help, even if it doesn't necessarily resolve any problems directly.
* Finding this subreddit and seeing the shared experiences of other caregivers has been moderately helpful.
* I paid $150 out of pocket to see a local neurologist, as my family member is extremely distrustful of doctors and did not want to go so the visit could not be billed against their Medicare insurance. This enabled me to ask a handful of questions I had. I would categorize this as not overly helpful, but it gave me piece of mind at the time.

This is not something I did recently, but have had for a while and recommend looking into if it isn't already in place: a will, power of attorney for financial and medical decisions. Having these documents enabled me to help schedule doctors appointments, request medical records and I am sure will be needed going forward as well.
If you're in the US, it's helpful to get an attorney who specializes in Elder Law to help you organize your mom's legal affairs -- bank accounts, wills, property, etc. Unlike ""general"" attorneys, Elder Law attorneys know how to advocate for your mom & you, and will help you navigate the system where elderly people often get lost or left out. They understand the intricacies of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, hospital billing, etc. Our healthcare system is a giant labyrinth of red tape, bureaucracy, and hidden loopholes, and you'll need to have an ally in the legalities of the process. 

It's also helpful to learn as much as you can about Alzheimer's so you understand what's happening to your mom and what you can expect during the remainder of her life, like how best to communicate with her, tricks of the trade so to speak -- others who have been going through this can offer a lot of ideas and support. Don't isolate and try to do it all on your own! Your state /county/city should have an Office of Aging and can direct you to organizations and support groups, elder day care centers, etc., as well as agencies that can help with meals, transportation, etc. 

When my brother was still being cared for at home, I traveled there twice a month to help his wife and give her ""time off.""  I learned as much as I could about Alzheimers and it helped me realize how my brother's decline progressed, what to expect, etc.  I learned a lot from videos by [Teepa Snow](https://youtu.be/xTw63fDdHrQ), an expert in the field who trains caregivers. From her videos, I learned what's happening in Alzheimer's: bluntly put, the brain is dying, and in predictable stages. If we can understand that, we can provide more relevant care during each stage (such as ways to communicate), and prevent our own unrealistic expectations and our loved one's frustrations.

My heart goes out to you! It's not an easy transition from child to caregiver of our parent! And I know it's heartbreaking to see your mom's decline. 

One reassuring thing to remember is that, if your mom is like most patients, as the disease progresses, she won't realize she has dementia or that life has drastically changed, so feeling sorry for her because she's lost her intellect isn't necessary -- she doesn't know that she doesn't know!  The hardest part is that she's not the mom you knew when you were growing up, and (understandably) you're grieving the loss of her. Allow yourself to grieve because it sucks! Take care of yourself and find as much help and support as you can. You can't do it all yourself!
I'm around the same age as you, OP. Talk therapy helped me for a few years when I was having trouble accepting reality. Now that mom is in a good facility, I pour my energy into things I can control. Like researching Alzheimer's prevention and improving my lifestyle and health so I can hopefully avoid getting it myself.
There is a group called The Memory People on Facebook that is very active and helpful.
I'm 28, in year 8 of my dad's fight. I can say that I have not processed it . Every time I think I have come to terms and accepted, something else happens and I'm back to square one. I have taken care of him more than my siblings though and I have dealt with it much better than they have so I would say being around them helps you understand what's happening.
I see a psychologist monthly.  I was fortunate to find someone who lost her own spouse to Alzheimer's some years ago, so she's familiar with the territory.  She's adept at pointing out how well (and how much) I am managing.
I can only suggest a few books that really helped me…Contented Dementia by Oliver James, Pocket Gunderstand to Alzheimers, and a new book by Patti Davis “Floating in the Deep End.” I wish you all the comfort and peace in this world.  You are trying and that makes all the difference.

Alzheimers,grandma forgot who i was today for the first time,"she’s recently diagnosed. we didn’t even know she was diagnosed because she wouldn’t tell us. i was the first family member she forgot about. 
for context, i live with my grandma. i went downstairs to get breakfast and my entire family was there. my grandma asked who i was and i immediately knew she wasn’t joking. 

i think it might’ve been an episode because later i asked if she knew who i was (which upon reading this subreddit i now know i shouldn’t do i think?) and she said my name and that i’m her granddaughter. i haven’t stopped crying though. it’s getting bad.

i don’t even know if she actually remembers me or if she feels bad and is pretending.

i feel so much pain just from this one instance. i don’t know how you all can manage. 

do you guys know any resources or places that can educate me more on alzheimer’s? thank you all so much for your help.","There is a book, The 36 Hour Day that was very helpful to me. Get the latest edition, it's hard in places because you'll be learning what's happening and what will happen but it's a very good resource. 

You may also have support groups near you that have additional resources plus shared experiences. 

I'm sorry you're going through this, it's brutal.
My mother has vascular dementia and lives out of state. I have not able to see her in over 2 years because of covid and she doesn’t talk on the phone. I’m not sure if she remembers me, but what really matters , is that I remember her. Just know that she doesn’t mean to forget you. It’s not her its the disease. She will always be your grandma .
She may remember the concept of you for much longer than she can recognize your face reliably.

A year ago, my grandmother said ""you look a lot like [granddaughter], but she just finished high school"" and didn't believe I could be the same person. She remembered Me as younger. So I asked her to tell me about MyName and her favorite memories with her.
When my mom started showing sign of dementia, we would correct her -  no, that's cousin Ann, not Linda.  No, today is Friday, not Tuesday.

Unless the information is critical, let it go.  Don't argue.  Argument just increases agitation and makes the situation far worse.

The only ""critical"" types of Q&A that I have with mom are things like ""yes, we do have to put on shoes to get in the car now (to go to the doctors office).  ""Yes, you do need to take medicine now""

Repetition and consistency are your friend.  If she has meals, med and bedtime at the same time everyday, it helps.

If she is living alone, consider a motion activated camera focused on the stove and the doors leading outside.  We had to do that with our mom in the weeks before we finally determined that she couldn't live alone.

I'm so sorry.  It won't get better.  But you can make this a little easier on yourself and family if you read up on this, agree on treatment, and especially agree on how to interact with grandma on,a daily basis.
I’m so sorry. I don’t know how much you have discussed this with your family yet, but you will need to talk about the future, and what you all will do as her condition deteriorates. For some (like my mother), the process is agonizingly slow, with ups and downs, lots of roller coaster rides between good and bad days. For others, it is a fast downhill decline. Getting everyone in the loop and on the same page about the planned course of action will become important as time progresses. Have one of her children (as they will likely become her guardian) contact your local Agency on Aging, as they will become an important resource for help and support as the disease progresses.

I’m so sorry that you were hurt by her forgetting. They don’t mean to, as you know, but it does hurt nonetheless. Journaling is a good outlet for this, as is therapy if you have access to it. A support group, sometimes available for free at local memory care facilities, may also be something to look into. Wishing you all the best, and know that everyone on this board understands the pain and difficulty involved. This is a place you can unpack that stuff. 🦋
Is she on any medication? Even in moderate stage, over the summer/early fall (more sunlight and social exposure), and getting her consistently on Aricept and Seroquel ... my grandmother did stop thinking I/rest of my family was a fake body double of ourselves who were trying to gaslight her. (This is called Capgras delusion)
I'm so sorry you're going through this. A similar situation just happened to me today as well, so believe me when I tell you the wound and pain are still very fresh for me as well.

I decided to google how to cope because it was the first time I truly felt I needed help coping & your post was the first one I found. I've spent the last few hours reading this sub & I've found comfort that I've never been able to find before just by talking to friends about it. I don't really have any suggestions for you in terms of resources for education on the topic because I usually just read articles on google, but I just wanted to tell you that you're not alone and to let you know that your post has helped me tremendously, so thank you for sharing.

Hopefully my story will help you feel a little bit less alone as well. So yesterday, my mom (who generally likes to quiz my grandma to see what she's capable of remembering) was asking her who her granddaughter was (for context: granddaughter & niece are synonymous in my grandmother's native language & I'm her only grandchild) and instead of saying my name, my grandmother listed her three nieces' names. My mother then had to remind her that she had a child, which my grandmother had to think about for a moment and only then did she remember about my existence.

Then later that evening, I was eating dinner with them and my mother decided to ask my grandmother if she knew how old I was to which my grandmother said, ""not exactly, but I think I know the range"" so we asked her the range and she said 16-17. I'm turning 23 this month. To be fair, I look really young especially when I'm not wearing makeup, so I did look in that range, but it still sucked hearing her answer incorrectly. 

Anyways, I was devastated. I was very, very close with my grandmother my whole life and even though you know the day is coming when your loved one(s) begin(s) to forget you, nothing prepares you for it.

I, too, haven't stopped crying, but I hope that this helped you feel a little bit less alone. Sending you lots of love <3",2021-12-02 05:23:56,IdealExtension1342,r74giy
Alzheimers,Exaspertion!,"Hi everyone, 

I have been working hard over the past two or three weeks to arrange residential aged care for my mother, who at first  was dead set against it. She has been in hospital for two months due to a huge delirium eposide followed by the diagnosis of her Alzheimers and other health issues and the doctors would not let her go home, saying she now needs 24/7 nursing care She has severe COPD, a movement disorder which makes her fall, incontinence and now Alzheimers.

She got accepted today to a really great place  - perfect for her. She even agreed on this choice (from the brochures) and was looking forward to getting out of hospital. She was due to go on Monday.

Then today the hospital called and said she has a COPD exacerbation, which is being treated with antibiotics and they are hoping it will improve by Monday.....but they are not sure if it will ever get better - it could turn into pneumonia or they just might not be able to get on top of it. They gave me the 'talk' about how much we think they should treat her and all that goes with it. We hope it doesn't come to that. This doctor was hopeful that because her oxygen levels haven't changed that she will rally, but oh boy, she sure knows how to throw a curve ball!

Thanks for reading. Not sure what I am feeling right now.","Oh, I'm sorry.  It's so hard to live with uncertainty.  It sounds like you have the bases covered for your mom's care.

Be sure to take care of yourself and the rest of your family in the.meantime.  Spend a little time on doing something fun.
I hope it all works out.
UGH!! I hate it when I make a spelling error in the title!!
Update: She is in the nursing home and seems to be coping weith it. They need to get to know her and her needs so there are teething problems, and of course I get the blame for them. I broke down there today, trying to tell the carer what she needs. I think it was bercause I am so eshausted! 

Thanks for the supportive comments, much appreciated!",2021-12-02 03:05:07,nuance61,r72h7o
Alzheimers,"Help, my grandma says she can’t breathe","My grandma has moderate Alzheimer’s and recently she has been telling everyone she can’t breathe. After 7+ visits to the doctor and the emergency room this past week, she was given a machine for oxygen. However, she still states she can’t seem to catch her breathe and she insists that the machine isn’t working correctly. She was without oxygen for a few hours yesterday but had no idea that the temporary tank they gave her ran out.  (She was fine during this time and didn’t complain) she keeps insisting on going back to emergency to which the we doctors tell me that she is fine and that her oxygen levels are fine. I could really use some advice as we are all out of ideas. TIA","It doesn't solve the whole problem but there are at home oximeters you can wear on finger or wrist or both. That way you can check for yourself if she's really having oxygenation problems. Make sure she'd tolerate actually wearing one though. 

You can get cheap ones on amazon but some clinicians (not all) will say those are unreliable and may be able to recommend a reputable vendor for you. Can be pricey but it could save you the cost of ER visits. Some will even record her O2 for a couple hours if thats a feature you want. 

Then, it might help you stay calm enough to maybe identify something thats triggering anxiety in her. Heck maybe just wearing am oximeter and being attended to in a clinical care looking set up will keep her calm?
My mom says her shoulders hurt so much that she can’t raise her arms, and she talks about this constantly. She insists on wearing bras with very thin straps because they “don’t hurt” and always needs help putting on coats. But… her shoulders are fine. When she’s focused on something else, she reaches above her head to get stuff from the fridge or cabinets. We think she does have some arthritis, but 80-90% of this just seems to be that she knows she’s ill and doesn’t know how to express that it’s her brain.  We go along with it, so no solutions for you except maybe not to worry about it as much? And lots of watches these days will measure pulse ox too and have a gps that could be useful for wandering, if that helps….
My grandmother complains of constant nausea and has been doing so for a very long time now. After many visits to countless doctors, it turns out there's nothing wrong with her stomach and there's nothing that would be causing the chronic nausea that she complains of. My mother, her primary caregiver, just gives her an OTC anti-nausea pill everyday (my grandmother's doctors are fine with this) to appease her and while she still complains occasionally, it seems to at least somewhat do the trick.

I think getting the watch that the other commenters suggested is a good idea for *your* sake so you can keep an eye on her oxygen levels and make sure there's nothing truly wrong. 

However, based on the fact that she was fine without oxygen when she didn't know she was without it but immediately complained once she knew that 'safety' was gone, I'd say there's the chance that she might still have her complaints even if the watch claims she's perfectly fine (such as my grandmother continuing to complain of nausea despite it being confirmed by numerous doctors that there is no issue & the other commenter's mother complaining of shoulder pain despite her shoulders being fine).

To appease your grandmother, I think you really just have to go along with it and I think the idea with the empty tank is actually pretty brilliant lol. It's the equivalent of my grandmother taking the OTC anti-nausea medicine, which she thinks is working, but we know is just to make her feel comforted. Wishing you the best!
Yes the cheap pulseox devices at the local pharmacy work great.  Sometimes people get that sensation if they have fallen and broken a shoulder or rib. Allergic reactions can also create that sensation.",2021-12-02 00:19:35,lunacyfringe87,r6zqad
Alzheimers,my grandmother is continually trying to get up and sit down nonstop,"it's constant. she cannot walk on her own, and they've put her on Ativan 2x day and a sleeping med at night, but every waking moment she is trying to get up and (if I help her stand) immediately sitting down again. I don't know how to help her feel more comfortable. I'm just at a loss and she's so agitated. she can't remember why she wants to get up but she wants to get up literally every waking second. has anyone else had a similar experience?","My grandma was like this. My mom got a recliner that was relatively deep, and gave her a baby doll that had eyes that closed when it was laying down. That made it difficult for her to get up, and also less inclined to want to bc she didn't want to wake the doll. It probably logistically helped that my grandma was physically small so she couldnt quite reach the lever to unrecline even if she wanted to.
My dad used to get up, check the time on the clock (bad eye sight so he had to walk right up to it), then check the front door to make sure it's locked, then sat back down. 2 min later rinse and repeat. Sometimes we would ask him what he's looking for and he would say he didn't know. He also didn't like to go out on walks to exercise at that point so my mom said well at least he's getting some exercise.
My mom did that. I made the mistake of taking her to the coast for a trip as she grew up in a seaside town and always missed it. The first night there, she was up and down every few minutes to go look at the water and moon again. At 2 a.m., she was still wide awake and up and down, I'd been up since 5 a.m., had driven the five hours to the coast, and was struggling to stay awake. It was after that experience that I realized I didn't have it in me to go through months of this. I talked to her doctors who said she was already on medications designed to make her sleep, and they weren't working. We looked into assisted living at that point. It's expensive, but it's given me the chance to focus on myself.
My LO does this. It's been a journey but we've taken her off all the ""relaxing"" drugs and it has helped significantly. In that, she is more able to walk on her own and does not need side-by-side supervision anymore.The meds didn't help; they may have made her more irritated and she walked more. Plus we had to put a gait belt on her and literally hold her up for hours a day while she walked. Like she wants to walk around to ""wake up"" maybe? Or it's like how benadryl works some people up? At any rate, she seems more relaxed without the meds, especially the sedatives (ativan).  Everyone's journey is different of course.

We still have someone around all the time. She needs help with everything. It's most difficult for meal times, because she wants to get up and walk. We kind of trap her in a wheel chair and a table that goes over it at meal times. If she is clearly tired or limping (especially if her shoes aren't on) we reduce stimulation (music, light etc) and tuck her into bed. Sometimes that works... not always. 

All the family wants to put a pedometer on her. Maybe Santa will bring her one this year.
My mother has been doing this for months now.  She is in an Alz home. Before I ring their doorbell, I can see where she sits all day reaching like she wants to stand. It's like she forgets how to stand.",2021-12-01 20:32:40,dominoKEI,r6v7q5
Alzheimers,My grandma with advanced Alzheimer's doesn't even enjoy The Wizard of Oz anymore. It was her favorite movie.,"My grandma was crying again just before because of general confusion and I gave her a long hug, and just kept saying ""You're okay, it's okay. It's going to be okay."" So I put on The Wizard of Oz, which always seems to cheer her up. She saw it in theaters in 1939, when she was seven years old. She became a lifelong fan of Judy Garland. Just last year, around this time, she watched it and loved it. The next day, she was sad and said ""I want to watch The Wizard of Oz again."" 

2021 has been a devastating year for her. Around April, it was becoming more and more obvious to all of us that she was hitting a new stage. Now, I'm just feeling so awful. I was saying at the beginning ""Look grandma. It's The Wizard of Oz. Your favorite movie."" No reaction. One good thing was when Judy Garland was singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow, I said ""It's Judy Garland."" She smiled and said ""Yes! You like her?"" I said yes. But for most of it during the first 20 minutes, she wasn't into it. In fact she just said ""This on the picture, it's cute. But it's enough."" Then she wanted to go back upstairs. This has got to be the cruelest disease in the world.","What I found brings a little happiness to my dear Mum and Dad is to 'sing' familiar songs myself with and to them...

my mum has been calling me 'nurse' for a good while,  and my dad has been calling me 'mummy' (what he used to call my mum).

A couple of days ago my Mum was waiting for my brother to visit.. when he was already there beside her.

this disease is so cruel.

I kiss and hug them. and visit very often..that's all they really want.

They've been in a care home for some years.

I'm so grateful for this sub and all the amazing people here.
I'm so sorry you're hurting. Remember that though the dialog may not stir a response, memory of melody and song is frequently the last thing to go. The best gift when Mom was in hospice those last weeks was replaying her favorite songs. She particularly loved it when her grandchildren recorded their favorite lullabies (that she'd sung to them) so we could play them over and over.

The best part of using music to reach your grandma is that singing to her will make you feel better, too. You are My Sunshine, Red River Valley, and Toora Loora were magical for us,

xoxo
Today my mother said she don't know if I am her son, or if she have any son. I don't know if it is an effect of the medication (aripiprazole) or just the disease progressing, but I share your feelings. She still know who I am and is being very gentle recently, but sometimes I feel like I live with a shadow or a ghost, seeing apathy increasing and memories fading. I hope to enjoy time with her while she still have some mental clarity. One wish is trying to participate in a walk event and take lots of photos in it.

I wish strenght and wisdom in your journey! Hugs for you both.
hugs to you.
Don't give up on the Wizard of Oz! Just because she didn't respond positively this time doesn't mean next time won't be really great. Sometimes these things are hit and miss. 

Sending strength and happiness to you and your gran!
One thing that has helped me through taking care of my mother is thinking and treating her as a new friend instead of the person I've known my whole life.  We want our loved ones to continue being the person they are, but this terrible disease is changing them and we must follow their path instead of forcing them onto one that is more comfortable for us.  When we say things like, ""You used to love this movie"" that only makes them confused and when we constantly remind them of what they are forgetting or what they were like in their old life, that only makes them frustrated or sad...or worse, mad at you

By all means, play their favorite movie or perform their favorite song.  But, if you are not getting the reaction YOU want, that's not on them...it's on your expectations",2021-11-30 15:59:30,JordanLeigh7,r5x9ya

Alzheimers,"Seeking advice, or recommendations to find it.","Our mom has Alzheimer's. It seems to be progressing pretty fast. She pretty much needs 24 hour assistance. She currently lives in a small town with a friend of many years. This friend has become her default caretaker. We have arranged someone else to come in 3 days per week to help with showering and housework as well as to give the other lady a break now and then. Both my mom and her friend are in their late 70s to early 80s. It has become evident that her friend is no longer able to provide the supervision necessary for my mom, and living in a small town there are no good options to get her competent 24 hour care. 

We are currently starting the process of fixing up the house next to my brother's house. He bought it a while back and was planning on renting it out. Our plans were to move her in there which is closer to a big city and we should be able to get competent help as well as having her close to my brother and his wife, me and my wife, and my brother's daughter and her husband and child. She also loves animals and would be able to spend time with my brother's dogs and I would take mine over to visit on weekends. 

We just recently found that she has been trying to roam at night. I had to put up door chimes because she went outside naked at 4 am. I then found out today that when her and her friend were at the hair salon she went to the bathroom and walked back out naked. She should not have been going to the bathroom alone anyway, but it happened. 

I am starting to question whether 24 hour home care would be better than moving her into a memory clinic. They are set up for people with dementia and I am hoping would be able to work better with her doctor to treat symptoms and recognize symptomatic behavior than a non medical home care giver. They also have a routine and she would be around people in a similar situation, so she might not feel so embarrassed all of the time. 

She recently inherited enough money to pay for any care that we decide to go with assuming she is not some anomaly that lives to be well past 100.

I would prefer to move her into the house and be able to visit whenever we want and feel like she had some independence, but I am concerned that this inclination, much like letting her stay in her house with her friend caring for her is what is easier and will make me feel less guilty, not that it is what is best for her. 

I also worry that making the decision to put her in the clinic is more or less because it would be cheaper than 24 hour at home care and once it was done, would be less work and decision making on our part. 

We need some unbiased input. I am looking for a doctor that specializes in memory care in our area and hope to see if they will give any input, but for now thought I would ask here.

Thank you if you read all the way through, and doubly so if you have any input.","Judging by this I would lean more towards a memory care unit
Moved are very difficult on them. So multiple moves in a short period of time is going to be even more jarring. If she's already wandering and forgets to dress herself, and needs help in the bathroom, I think moving her into a house, even next door, could be more dangerous than help.   Obviously, just my opinion, but they need so much assistance and a constant eye the more it progresses.
My mom was diagnosed with alzheimers 5 years ago.  Dad was able to care for her, with our help at first.

Dad passed away.  Mom couldn't be trusted with using the stove.  She went outside at night a few times.  We put motion activated cameras in the kitchen and at the doors.  Within a couple of weeks of putting in the cameras, we realized we couldn't make sure that she was safe.

That's the question you have to ask yourself. Will she be safe from wandering?  When the camera rings, who will get out of bed immediately and run outside, day and night?  For months.  During winter.  Who does this during work hours?

Also, as someone else said, multiple moves in a short period of time is very disorienting.

I suggest you seriously consider 24 hr memory care facility. I know, it feels horrible to do this, but she will be safe.  She will get meals and meds  on a schedule, which is so important .

My mom is now in a memory care facility.  They make sure her hair is washed, her clothes and sheets are cleaned, have stimulation activities daily, trained caregivers and a nurse.

You have to do what is best for your mom's health.  You also have to make sure that family caregivers will not be burned out by taking care of mom 24/7.",2021-11-29 20:05:43,Anon876543210,r5aq31
Alzheimers,Mom lost her credit card and keeps losing her ID.,"I am her POA. I was allowing her to keep her physical credit card but she keeps losing it and her drivers license. They are somewhere in her apartment but I can't find either and neither can she. I hate to do it but I think I will report her credit card lost, and then keep the new one and only order her groceries online. She also keeps losing her cash, her wallet, etc.

How have you guys gone about this without making the person with AD hate you? I already feel like her AD has ruined my relationship with her. I took away her car, I made her move into senior living like her doctor suggested, etc.

I'm so sick of being the bad guy.","I think you are in the right track: A wallet with expired or fake cards and cash.
My Dad got my Mom the Apple Airtags and mapped them to his phone. There's sort of a money-clip attachment that he clipped on to her wallet, so every time she loses it he can play a sound and find it again. Her drivers license and (single) credit card never come out of her wallet, because she never uses either one.
Check in the mattress, shoe boxes, or any other place not logical to you. She probably hides them from thief/cleaning lady/shadow people/all of the above.
I got copies of both for my husband.   I kept the spares and when he would hide his wallet somewhere to keep it safe I could produce the identical wallet with ID and card.  I would eventually find the spare.  I kept copies in a file as well.
I allowed my husband to lose his whole wallet about three times, and then I said ""You can't keep track of things so I'm going to hold your ID and close your credit cards.""  Whenever possible and safe, I have let the real world dictate changes.  He couldn't argue about whether he tends to lose things a lot!

I sometimes give him a little cash ($20) to go into a store and get something, which he seems to enjoy.  I figure I can afford to lose $20, but a lost credit card jeopardizes a lot more than that.

He has lost the medical ID bracelet I bought him.  I'm debating whether it's worth it to order another.  He would probably just lose that too.

I keep all his important documents - picture ID, insurance card, vaccination card, etc., in my wallet.",2021-11-29 13:15:59,Missmoneysterling,r51wez
Alzheimers,Caring for parents that cared for their parents.,"My mom cared for my grandma who passed away from Alzheimers a number of years ago and now I have the honor of caring for my mom as she navigates her own bout. 

Oddly, the techniques I use to help my mom, I learned from her as she cared for my grandma. 

A thought I have, that always makes my eyes well up is that if she was totally aware of what was happening now, she'd be super proud of how I'm caring for her and would probably laugh at all the goofy stuff she says and does because of this disease. 

For those of us that are caring for our parents, I hope you know they're proud of you too.","My mom is now in the same nursing home she had placed  her mom in. They were only 16 years apart. The gift I want to give to my children is to please find a way if I develop early alz  to not take care of me. I want them to place me in a warm caring home and  visit when they can. I want  them to live their lives fully and not feel the pressure of long term care. My grandma was 10 years unable and my mom is now on year 11 with 4 years in a almost non responsive state. I want my kids to live their lives..  they are in their teens and have never know a life without alz in it.. i could die happy knowing they were off having fun.
Mum never wanted to be a burden to her kids, and honestly, none of her kids are the nurturing/nursing type. I'll be forever grateful that she saved, invested, and made all the right choices such that she's paying professionals to take care of her.
I don’t think it’s odd that you learned the techniques from watching her care for someone else. God bless you ❤️ she would definitely be proud",2021-11-29 14:44:17,thingsjusthappen,r53ub6

Alzheimers,Feeding tube or no?,,"If your Alzheimer's person is in need of a feeding tube because they are at end stage Alzheimer's its definitely ""no"" to me. The link from other commenter is most of the reasons why. 

If they are that far gone, you might consider hospice care. They can help you decide and are generally very good at their jobs. They will be able to give some meds to help it be an easier and less painful for them goodbye. Or they (or the physician who will need to approve hospice care) can help determine if there's a reason to keep fighting. 

In the US, from what I understand, without a plan in place, intubating can sometimes be the default action a hospital will take, because its their function to preserve life. But once that tube or other life sustaining measures are in, it can be legally or policy-wise hard to get that tube out. And i would guess even more emotionally wrought than having never had it put in in the first place.

I strongly recommend you consult a doc, particularly one who can guide you about hospice.
No.  Of course, you have to make your own decisions.  We just made this for my father.  Here is one article to read with regard to this topic... and I am so sorry that you are going through this.  https://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/feeding-tubes-for-people-with-alzheimers/
I remember this decision.  My mom made it easy by putting it in her advance directive.  She didn't want to receive life-sustaining treatment, but it didn't make it any easier to turn it down when she had a sudden stroke.  It felt like being hit with a ton of bricks to say 'no' - especially when considering what it really meant. It didn't get easier in the days just after making the decision.  I had to go through the process first to find my peace.  Having other supportive family visit to say their goodbyes to Mom made it a lot easier.  It was something I'll never forget.

In hindsight, I'm so glad I followed Mom's directions.  There was no hope for recovery from her advanced Alzheimers.  A feeding tube would have made things so much more prolonged and uncomfortable for her.  The process of her passing was nothing like I expected it to be.  The body has miraculous and peaceful ways to deal with dying.  In my Mom's case, feeding her could have led to other complications where she could aspirate food, so all we could do was keep her mouth and lips moist.  It took a week or two for her to pass at the memory care facility, but she was comfortable and peaceful, and we had lots of time to sit with her and say our goodbyes.

Many thoughts and prayers to you.  You are doing the most loving, and yet difficult act of kindness imaginable.
I am strongly opposed. I wouldn't do anything that may prolong the life of someone suffering from AZ
My mom has clear instructions in her advance directive and again in the instructions she gave me as medical POA that she's DNR, no feed tubes, and no ventilators. She also has it all in her COLST forms.
Hard NO

Alzheimers,Worry of what the future may bring.,Having suffered watching family members be destroyed by this disease. How do you deal with the fear of or plan for what may happen to you.,"I'm trying to travel and do interesting things before retirement. As opposed to many people who save the important experiences for after retirement. 
I'm also aiming to always have some kind of job, for mental stimulation.
When you worry you suffer twice. My suggestion: Go about your life and live it to the fullest.
If you’re concerned about your future mental health because of a strong family history of Alzheimer’s and you’re worried about your future quality of care and not burdening your family, just make plans in advance. Make sure you have a strong Will and medical health directives. Set up a trust or other financial directions you want followed to pay for your care. Maybe even shop around for facilities/care providers in advance. Just have a general idea of where and when you will need care and make those plans known to your family so it isn’t a last minute shit show. Speak with a family attorney and give them instructions on who you want appointed as your  POA or guardian when the time comes, then just live your life knowing you’ve done all you can to make it easy for those that love you to ensure your safety with as little stress as possible. Everyone is different and if it does happen to you, you may or may not want to accept help when you need it, so having planned in advance and giving your family the knowledge and tools they will need to help you before they need them is the BEST way to avoid painful surprises
Live life now, but also make sure to always do something everyday to stimulate your mind.  And, be extra diligent in your oral/teeth care. There is growing evidence that bad oral hygiene can worsen or even cause AD.  My mom is in late stage AD, and has no memories of anyone in her life (my dad, me, nor my sisters). My dad is rapidly showing signs that he is headed that way. Both were/are not very progressive in their oral hygiene, though at 86 years old, that unfortunately seems to be the norm. The evidence is that the bacteria that causes gingivitis is implicated in some large fraction of AD cases, though the science isn’t 100% settled, and their are likely other causes as well.  Best of luck to you and yours… and to me and my sisters.
I have had the discussion with my kids not to give up their lives for mine and discussed options. When my kids are out of college and we downsize our home, I'll redo the will as well.
I have no family able to care for me if I have an illness that is debilitating. I will be taking myself out at some point before it gets too difficult.
eat healthier, exercise, spend more time with loved ones, live life....imo if you are worrying all the time of it, you are wasting the time you have in between
Tough question. If I get a diagnosis of dementia I will probably just kill myself
I train myself to be comfortable in isolation, because I know that others won't want to be around me. a psychic told me to learn to let go so i try to do that.
Dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s runs in my family. I’m at risk for early onset, likely in my 50’s. And if I have the gene it’s not if it’s when and there is a 50/50 chance I have it. 

When I found out I had to grieve for my mom and for myself. I was depressed for a while and then I realized I could get tested. I haven’t yet but I’ve decided to live as if I only have 25 more good years anyway. I changed a lot of my life goals and priorities and I have no regrets, gene or no gene. I’m still figuring it out but I will definitely have a solid financial structure in place and insurance taken care of before I do the genetic testing - which btw I’m doing through a clinical research trial so it can’t make me ineligible for long term care. 

My brother and I already agreed that if we don’t have a spouse that can care for us we will do it for each other so our kids are not burdened. My mom was adamant that we not pause our lives for her considering we may share her fate and my dad is committed to taking care of her til the end god bless him.",2021-11-28 10:40:10,dmbgreen,r470yg

Alzheimers,Some days are really worth it.,"Some days can be really, brilliantly, good. Today grandma was really talkative, even asking for her hearing aids (that she normally refuses). Did all the exercises without complaints.  Learned how to use the new TV remote. Ate at relatively sensible times, even made herself a snack when I was distracted on the phone. She remembered a friend is coming tomorrow so has to go to bed at a sensible time.
When I made dinner, she gave me a big smile, said she knows she is awkward sometimes and thanked me for looking after her.
I had to run off and have a happy cry…","❤️
That's such a wonderful thing. The ups and downs can give you whiplash its true, but those good days feel like an emotional reset for me as a carer, like a big release of stress.
Thar is awesome.  Great day.
Thank you for sharing. Need to hear
Awww...

I do think it is useful to ""stop and smell the roses,"" so to speak, when there is a good day.  I gave my husband a big hug before I gave him his morning coffee.  Immediately on getting back in his recliner he wondered where he left his glasses, of course!

Alzheimers,Our journey has come to an end,"My dad passed suddenly today. Yesterday we were told he wasn't eating much and today the same. Not an hour after I spoke to the hospice nurse, they called back to say my dad had passed. He was 71 and had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2018. We had just moved him to a new facility a little over two weeks ago after a tumultuous experience with his old facility. The hospice nurses were with my dad when he passed. Unfortunately I nor my mom were there as I am waiting to pick her up at the airport. I don't know how I'll tell her. She'll never forgive herself. Thank you for all the support. You all are lifesavers.","I’m so sorry for your loss. I hope you and your mom will find peace this holiday season. 💔
I'm sorry for your loss. Wishing you and your mom the best in this difficult time.
All good thoughts to you and your mother. I hope you find much comfort in each other's company as you remember your dad.
So sorry for your loss. I, too, hope you and yr mom can find peace this holiday season.
We called in hospice yesterday so , I’m about to go through the same.
I'm so sorry, may he rest in peace
Tell her not to blame herself, blame the illness, you did your best.
Things happen in their own due time, at their own pace. Your Mom needs to forgive herself. She couldn't stop the disease or his eventual demise. Alzheimers holds everyone hostage. The person caught up in it is just the main victim. Every member of the family, friends, loved ones, all are trapped on the joyride, swept along to who knows where or when. All one can do is survive the best they are able. It's a massive challenge getting through each day, especially knowing tomorrow may be even worse. My condolences to you and your family. You are left with the memories of the good times and he has been released from the prison his mind and body had become. Shalom to you and yours.
So very sorry for your loss.  Death is my fear if I move my father to new memory care unit at assisted living from his current facility who seem to be playing games.
i’m so so sorry. had a near identical experience just a month ago. praying you have peace; it’s a difficult pill to swallow.
So sorry, peace for you and your family.

Alzheimers,Question,My father-in-law is starting to show signs of Alzheimer's. He keeps accusing my dog of peeing on the floor but my dog isn't. We tell him that the floor is dry and my dog didn't pee and my father-in-law yells at us and says we're accusing him of lieing. He gets really mad at us. How do I handle that? It's not the only thing he does that with.,"If he does have Alzheimer's or another type of dementia, it's best to avoid trying to correct his version of reality, because you are never going to convince him that he is wrong.  Instead, you have to step into that reality with him, focus on acknowledging how he feels, reassuring him, and then redirecting his attention to something else.   

So you might say something like, ""Wow, Dad, I'm so sorry this is upsetting you so much.  We'll try to walk the dog more often in the future so this doesn't happen again.""  And then turn his attention to something he enjoys (TV, food, whatever). 

Obviously you need to swallow your pride a bit in order to be able to do this, but in my experience it's a hell of a lot easier than endlessly arguing over stuff like this.  It's important to remember that the world can be a very scary and confusing place when you have Alzheimer's.  Keeping this in mind can help us tailor our actions around compassion, which will make the disease much, much easier to deal with for all involved.
First of all I would suggest that your Father-in-Law may need a check up from his GP. He may have a UTI which can often bring on hallucinations in older people.  

Apparently the damage that Alzheimers does to a person’s brain can alter the way that they perceive their environment. Your Father-in-Law my look at the floor and think that its wet and is therefore unsafe for him to walk over. This can be down to something as simple as the change from a wooden floor to a rug but his brain is unable to process the information properly. He may get agitated when you tell him the floor is dry because he can still see it, it’s referred to as misperception.

When I take my Sister-in-Law out she has problems with steps and I realised that it’s because her perception isn’t the same as mine. 

Try to be reassuring and help your Father-In-Law feel safe
My mom has started saying men are coming into the house and stealing her undergarments. Obviously not true but to them it is very real. There is no use arguing. Just acknowledge them and then distract and deflect. I tell her she’s safe and I’ll lock her things away don’t worry here are some clean ones let’s read a story before bed I know you like this book! 

“oh that silly dog don’t worry about it I’ll clean it up, hey why don’t you sit down and watch tv while I take care of the mess” something like that. you have to go into their world they can’t come into ours anymore 

Upbeat tones tend to help. they can be quick to anger but quick to cheer up if you handle it right.

Creative activities for seniors with  Alzheimer's/dementia  
Think back or ask relatives and friends about your loved one’s passions and strengths. Then, encourage them to do similar things.  
1.**Try knitting or crochet**  
Put a homemade quilt or skein of yarn in your aging relative’s hands. Let them feel the weight of the quilt and the scratchiness of the yarn. They may still be able to crochet or knit a little bit, even if they have serious memory or cognitive deficits.   
2.**Experiment with sounds**  
If your relative with dementia was a musician or loved music, introduce simple instruments or sing-alongs. For seniors with mild cognitive decline, musical ability might outlast other memory functions. For those with more advanced impairment, nursery rhymes, maracas, and tambourines can still encourage creative expression.  
3.**Encourage visual expression**  
Painting and drawing are ways to express feelings safely and with creativity. Encourage using bold, bright colors on big surfaces. Rolls of butcher paper enable seniors with dementia to create without encountering the stress of defined spaces.  
4.**Create sensory experiences with tactile crafts**  
Working with slippery clay or malleable play-dough is a way for seniors with cognitive decline to benefit from tactile stimulation and creativity. Gewirtz suggests feeling a variety of objects with different shapes, sizes, and textures, as well as rubbing hands in lotion.  
5.**Combine happy memories and creativity via collages**  
Cut out images from magazines or print old ads and articles. Choose subjects that fit your loved one’s interests, like cooking, cars, or fashion. Another idea is to scan and print old family pictures. Let your family member with dementia arrange and rearrange the elements to create pictures or scrapbook pages.",2021-11-26 18:54:23,Rizbit_Zir,r304ay
Alzheimers,Anyone Using an Amazon Echo Product?,"Little bit of background: In early September of this year I became the primary caretaker for my uncle. I'd only met this man six times in my entire life, so it's been a whirlwind of change for everyone involved. He's been very independent in his life and despite being diagnosed with Alzheimers and moderate cognitive decline, he is living in his own studio apartment in a retirement community. As he progresses, I'm hoping he'll have enough money to move to their assisted living and then to their memory care. Well just have to see. Anyway, having had little contact with him over the years has presented a bit of a challenge as I don't know his routines, likes, etc. And his decline is much more readily apparent since he's been under my care because before he was living alone on a 20 acre property in a rural community and worked hard to keep himself together. 

I recently put an Amazon Echo Dot in his apartment. It allows him to play music he likes, find out the weather, simple things like that. I've also been able to find out that he often asks if I'm safe and where I am, so I set up routines so when he asks those questions he gets answers that give him comfort. I also set up a calendar to include activities offered in his community, with reminders and information about the location of the activity. This has been helpful to remind him when he needs to meet my mom (his sister) for a ride to the doctor, when his beloved Cowboys play and on what channel, etc. Just a note that I changed the default wake word from Alexa to Ziggy because he can remember Ziggy much easier. 

Yesterday I set things up so he can use the Echo to control his Christmas tree lights and his lamps by his couch. Next is the light in his ceiling fan and for Christmas I'll be setting up his television.

We still have issues with the product, but are finding this helps him maintain some independence, so I wonder if anyone else uses it and how it's used. Thanks!","Wow it sounds like he's able to really interact with it! My mom is far beyond being able to use it herself, but I ask it to play music for her all the time. Despite not being able to have a conversation, she can sing along to music from her youth, and it tends to comfort her and calm her anxieties.
I explored this and my grandmother's nursing home suggested if we did it that they had seen success with a chart style one page printed and hung up somewhere near the device that gives suggested commands that they might enjoy. My grand is a little beyond using these devices but earlier on I think she would have liked having it.
I used them. Mom could read a poster of commands for a while. We also had cameras. I could use the cameras and Echo to explain how to work the microwave or the tv remote. Recorded reminders were really helpful. We created playlists. Eventually we were playing calming music almost 24-7. They were lifesavers for us.
My mom could never figure it out. We'd hoped it would work for music. She loves music, but she stopped being able to work her CD player, a radio, or her old record player. We'd also hoped it would help her find her favorite shows by linking it to Netflix on her TV. That didn't work either. If we didn't put music on for her or set up her TV, she couldn't listen or watch.
It is hard to get them to interact with devices. I use a Google mini. I try and have a test run at least once every few months with having the person have the device call me. The person I'm involved with mostly plays music as well.
I am interested in this, but like many my mom has a hard time learning new technology. Could you elaborate a bit more on the ""routines"" feature, OP?

Alzheimers,My dad just said something awful to me,"Thanks everyone for your replies… my dad did apologize and I’m working on dealing with my sadness…

My parents and I have had a difficult relationship since I was a teenager due to my mother’s rage fits, which my father enabled. For many years they weren’t a part of my life and it was very hard. In the last ten years, I have reconnected with my dad and during the pandemic we became close, talking multiple times a week. More recently I am working on building a relationship with my mom. It is hard because I do get triggered around her, but things are getting better. 

For the past few months, I’ve been going through a conflict with my parents where my feelings got very hurt. My father has been crappy to me and has hardly called. The conflict was about me trying to come and spend more time with them and how to pay for that. My mom and I worked it out. 

Just now I was talking with my dad and explaining to him that my feelings were hurt by how he’s treated me. He said “well I was upset because you said some disturbing things about your mother.” What did I say? “You said you wished she was dead.”

I never have, and never would, say such a thing, particularly to my father. It killed me that he invented this memory about me (and no one else in the family) because I have been trying so hard to be there for him and be with him. I was also always the scapegoat for problems in our family. He has never said anything like this before or had an untrue memory before. Ithurts that I’m the first one. Looking for some support","You know the truth friend.  


It's not going to get easier, but you will quickly learn, adapt, and carry on.  It doesn't make it any easier right now, I wish it did.  Keep your head up, you are ok.  You are going to be ok.
I understand how bad this feels for you. I did not ever have a close relationship with my mother, who has always been unstable, depressed and at times volatile as well as being quite narcissistic. I found myself becoming her carer more and more since my dad passed away five years ago. She says cruel, hurtful things to me sometimes and makes things up as well. People say 'Oh, it's the disease' but it is hard for that statement to bring any comfort when she was always like that to me. She has always had a negative opinion of me, despite the fact that I am the only one of my siblings who has ever bothered to visit, remember birthdays, and now take care of all her needs. I am currently trying to arrange a place in a residential nursing facility and she hates me even more. 

I don't have any advice except for to take it a day at a time. I just wanted you to know that you weren't alone.
People with Alzheimer's have flawed and confused comprehension. 

Your father certainly could have failed to understand something that you said to your mother and, in his failing mind, thought that you said that you wish your mother was dead. 

Alzheimer's doesn't effect the physical senses but the comprehension of the sensory information is flawed.",2021-11-24 21:23:55,Effective-Papaya1209,r1lkth
Alzheimers,Any activities to help with cognition?,"Hey everyone, my dad has early onset alzheimers and we were looking for certain activities that help him with memory or basically just hobbies. Sudoku and puzzles didnt work well, so any ideas would be appreciated. Also, whoever is reading this who has a loved one with Alzheimers, or knows anyone who has it, you are not alone and focus on your loved one, not how awful the disease is, and you are not alone.

Edit- Wow, I was not expecting all of these helpful tips. Thanks to everyone!","When I asked my dad's neurologist the same question, she recommended just plain old conversation. She said word puzzles are fine if they enjoy doing them but they don't particularly help with cognition. I don't believe there is much to preserve cognition with dementia but she said conversation is the best for engaging the brain due to the brain having to constantly work (wondering what the person will say, how to respond, etc).

Socialization
If they ever played an instrument try and get them to start again. My gran has an online piano lessons once a week. Sometimes she spends most of it just chatting to the teacher, but that’s ok 👍
I usually think of music as a way to keep people with alz happier and I think this is a pretty well known thing.. But I would also at least consider it as one way to help in some way with cognition, maybe.  But i think this way of looking at music for Alzheimer's is not as universally agreed upon.

From my own experience, my when my mostly nonverbal Alzheimer's dad listened to his favorite song, and i had it on a loop when we went for a drive,  he just kind of nodded his head in time to the music at the beginning, and at the end (maybe 45 min later), he was singing some of the words and keeping better time. Not full sentences, nothing miraculous, but that he *appeared* to be improving during that short period was kind of amazing to me. Of course it might have just been a cumulative effect of his mood improving with each repeat.. But I mean mood is also known to affect cognition too (tho by different mechanisms from Alzheimer's, i think). 

I also agree with the other folks recommendations so far too. 

Anyway good luck.
Talking about interesting things. Maybe consider the [hygge conversation card game](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/the-hygge-conversation-game) for example. 

Get his hearing checked btw. And if he does have any hearing loss, get him hearing aids now, while he has capability to learn how to use them
We played board games.  As my mother’s cognition got worse we changed games. With help she was able to play Domino’s for a long time. Toward the end we played Hi Ho Cheerio and the like. We also did jigsaw puzzles together.
Socialization is SO important. my mother never declined faster than during covid. she has early onset as well and the longer she “hid” her diagnosis the longer she was able to feel comfortable socializing even if her friends already knew and were ok with it. We got 6 really good years after her diagnosis with minimal changes having to be made. And 3 after that where she was content to chit chat even if it didn’t totally make sense. If you can educate the people in their life and keep it as normal as possible for as long as possible that is more powerful than many realize.
Diet and exercise also play a part. This podcast was very enlightening for me, as someone from a family of early onset Alzheimer’s

Alzheimers,What next?,"My dad got his official Alzheimer’s diagnosis a few months ago after years of “generic” dementia. He lives with me in my home where I take care of him financially and also am his only caregiver. He can shower and feed himself right now but not much beyond that. 

I’ve been given no POA, no medical proxy, nothing. He’s too sick/stubborn to see he needs help and yet I am entirely responsible for him. Currently I commute an 75 minutes each way so he can stay in this town but I want to move and I don’t want to be responsible for him anymore. My therapist is shocked I’ve done as much as I have when it’s causing me crippling depression and anxiety. 

How do I get social services in? They’ve said I can’t call and request any services because I don’t have POA. I can’t get POA. I’ve spoken with the doctor and he said he can’t do much either. Sometimes, especially recently, I am tempted to leave him in the side of the road so a silver alert can be filed and he can get put in social services radar. 

Right now I’m hemorrhaging money and time. I’ve given up jobs, relationships, and financial freedom to care for him and I can’t kick him out. He had zero retirement, savings, or assets. 

At what point can I just say it’s too much for me and social services step in because I’m there. What would happen if he hadn’t already lived in my house I inherited when this all went down? I’m 100% alone and it’s beyond caregiver burn out. He needs to be someone else’s problem because he’s just mad at me for trying to take care of him.","I have no advice but I am SO sorry. This is my greatest fear. You’ve come to the right place for empathy. I hope some of the wonderful people on this sub can point you in the right direction.
This gets tossed out a lot on Reddit, but you need to talk to an attorney. There's too many different considerations involved here for you to navigate them successfully from casual advice on here.

Much of what you can do and how to do it will be location dependent. 

You don't want just any attorney though and I'm not sure what to suggest about how to find one who can deal with your father's needs and rights as well as yours. That'll take some calling and hunting. A local Bar Association may be able to help you with qualified recommendations and/or local Alzheimer support groups.

Best of luck.
Does he get Social Security? Are you sure he doesn’t have any assets?

I would explore that first so you can see if he can afford to live in a memory care community. 

That being said, it’s hard to do anything without a POA and a lawyer likely won’t grant one because of his condition. The courts would have to assign a conservator. That could take awhile. They do have volunteer conservators where I live for people who don’t have family who can do it. 

You are going through a super hard thing. It’s so hard. Good luck.
I would think if a Dr has given him an official Alzheimers diagnosis then he must of had mini mental exam and other tests to come to this diagnosis. Can you look into guardianship? Usually you have to go through the courts but it is the only way I know of in order to be able to make decisions for him. He may not be mentally capable of a POA at this point since he has official diagnosis. Apply for conservator or guardianship of him. Social services or Elder service organization should be able to advise you of the process. Good Luck!
Don't pay attention to anyone who tries to make you feel guilty for hitting your limit as a caregiver. They have no idea about your circumstances or the particulars of your relationship with your dad. and you deserve a life, your own family, and to save for your own retirement so you don't end up in your dad's position in the future! You really need to speak with an elder care attorney about your situation because it sounds a bit complicated. They can advise you on how to get him on Medicaid for long term care. Maybe also look for a social worker who's an expert in dementia who can give you some tips on how to interact with your dad and get him to do what he needs to do. I don't think social services ever really ""steps in"" though, unless you take him to an ER and say he's dangerous and you can't deal with him anymore. They will try to make you take him back because its easier for them, so you have to be ready to leave him there if you take this drastic step.
I'd say now. Before you start to hate him. It happens .
It's tougher to do this because of COVID cases filling up hospital beds, but drive him to the hospital. Say exactly what you've said here. You cannot handle it anymore. A hospital social worker should be assigned at that point to help find your dad suitable housing. He'll go onto Medicaid if he's truly out of money, and then he'll be moved to a Medicaid memory care community.
Usually in this situation, the patient injures themself and ends up in the hospital, then gets discharged directly to a skilled nursing facility for rehab. But you have to say, ""he lives alone. It is not safe for him to live at home.""

I would say, stop trying so hard *to the detriment of your own health* to control him and keep him safe. 

He is legally an independent adult. If he is hell-bent on self-destruction, it is his legal right. he did not give you POA when he was mentally well. you don’t have any custody over him.

if he has literally nothing to his name, then a Medicaid application (APPENDIX D) should be rather easy.

if Dad won’t even sign the application; then i think you have no other choice but to call the fire department with an anonymous tip about this guy with alzheimer’s who lives alone and is a danger to himself
Does your employer offer an employee assistance program? Often times you can get 1 legal consult,  5 therapy sessions, or other services for free. They may also be able to help you contact a social worker. I am going thru many of the same things you are and I am calling my employee program on Friday. This shit is hard, but you've got this!",2021-11-23 20:15:40,Brilliant-Coast-2222,r0sl6s
Alzheimers,Help with my 58 y/o mother,"My mother has early onset Alzheimer’s, she was diagnosed maybe 3ish years ago but has been exhibiting symptoms for maybe 5 years prior to her diagnosis.
In the last 6 months she has had significant cognitive decline. I can see it really affecting my family, especially my father who at this stage is her main carer but still works a full time job. 
Me and my sisters take turns and going over and spending time with her. Today I came over and she seems especially bad. She won’t get out of bed, she seems to have increased confusion and isn’t eating. She told me she threw up this morning and all she wants to do is sleep. I’m so worried about her and I’m also worried about my own mental health. Her decline has had a serious effect on my own person struggles with this terrible disease. 
Can anyone lend any insight, advice or kind words to support and help me and my family?","Unfortunately it doesn't get much better. But you have to utilise the time you have with her. Is she on medication? That was one thing that really impacted appetite, and its a struggle to get my mother to eat sometimes. But with some trial and error I've found things she will really dig in to food wise. So i try to take her to eat that as often as I can. I can relate in terms of struggling yourself, its not easy and people can be empathetic but really don't understand the day to day struggle. You need to make sure that whilst you are doing everything for your mother, you take time for yourself too. Don't let guilt get to you, your mental health and happiness is vital too. It's okay to take a step back and do things for yourself, you still need to live too. Is there anything she enjoys doing in particular? Something related to the arts? That she has done all her life or is a hobby? Try to incorporate more of these types of activities. I have learned that it's less about the places and more about the time together. Like I felt I had to take my mother to new places on the weekend, new malls, or new locations, but it didn't matter so much. We could go t o the same place every week and eat ice cream together and she'd be happy. You're doing a great job with a really tough situation, don't lose faith and always make sure you are taking care of yourself too.
I am sorry you and your family are facing such a difficult situation. You are doing the best you can do give yourself grace. Make sure you take time to rest whenever you can, and don’t feel guilty about asking for help. You guys need to take care of yourselves first, because if you can’t, you won’t be able to help your mom. Finding an artistic outlet can be helpful. We gave my dad paints and gel pens and coloring books and he could keep himself occupied for a really long time. We also played music that he liked and them at helped keep him calm. As far as food, I found that as ALZ progressed my dad only wanted to eat the foods of his youth (kind of like music…the things you like form in your teens and just kind of stick with you). He ate a lot of frozen pizzas and hot dogs and chips. He also liked cereal. It wasn’t super healthy but he had bigger fish to fry when it came to his health and the alternative was not eating at all. If you can start connecting with creative aging groups or ALZ support groups that will be the biggest help. Having a larger community makes the journey easier. Also might be a good time to look into a care provider who can come to your home, or a place where you can drop your mother off for a few hours. ALZ is a long and painful road, but keep your eyes open for the beautiful moments. There are more there than you think. I wish you and your family strength for the journey ahead.
You may want to get her checked for a UTI. My ALZ mother was exhibiting very similar symptoms last time she had one-Extreme confusion/sudden cognitive decline, lethargy, no appetite, wouldn't get out of bed. I'm not a medical professional, but reading your description of your mother's behavior immediately reminded me of my Mom last time she had a UTI.
Seek real medical advice, there are so many things that could be going on, it’s anyones guess.
Call a doc or nurse now",2021-11-23 19:09:18,neyo_no_hat,r0r7lo
Alzheimers,Concerns Grow Over Safety of Aduhelm After Death of Patient Who Got the Drug,,,2021-11-23 15:27:54,HoneyWest,r0mf40
Alzheimers,Bought Dad a Flipper for TV but still a problem,"I posted earlier about suggestions for a new tv remote for Dad & thanks to some great advice I got him a Flipper from the alzheimer's store. 

Problem now is he thinks the remote is a toy & only gives him pre-programmed tv shows & not what is actually on tv at the moment. Is there any way to solve these kinds of problems when they come up.","I switched out the remote too but still need to help my Dad operate it.
What is this Alzheimer’s store of which you speak?
After reading some posts here and other online forums I bought a Broadlink controller and a Tapo camera to face the tv. Both can be used by my phone and I'm able to turn on the tv on for my mum when I'm at work and choose something for her to watch. It took some time to get her to stop turning off the power at the wall socket. Sharpie, paper with notes on them and blu tack, and also blu tacking the remote to the table has been mostly effective as of late. She's remembering to use the controller now which is good. I'm so glad I got these items.",2021-11-22 19:07:33,Augustus_Chiggins,qzzvjd

Alzheimers,Sometimes you have to laugh to cope. Mom told us tonight she thinks she might be pregnant.,"Mom has moderate Alzheimers and has some days where she's far more confused than others. Today was a bad day; she was difficult, sometimes angry, demanding food after forgetting having just eaten. At the end of the night though she unknowingly lightened the mood by announcing to the family that she thinks she might be pregnant. Sometimes you have to laugh to cope.   
Edit: Apparently this is called ""Delusion of pregnancy"" and is an unusual symptom of dementia.","I’ve been reading 36-Hour Day and have so much anxiety and fear for the future. This made me laugh, thanks.
Yes. My mom was vere confronting in the past weeks, saying things so absurd against me that I could just laugh at the absurdity and the free rage. Now after we found an antipsychotic that's working well she's being very sweet.
my grandma gets obsessed about picking up leaves in her yard every fall (by hand, not with a rake lol) and she looked out the window and saw her yard covered and got so frustrated at all the leaves she couldnt think of the word for them. so she said “UGH just look at all those....those....FUCKLES! in the front yard!” 

(she never swears so this sent my mom and i into a fit)
The other day my dad accidentally said he has “ass hammers”.
My mom did that. She asked her assisted living staff to get her a pregnancy test and everything.
I took my dad on a tour of our old neighborhood. I pointed out my a stop sign and said, “there’s my old bus stop!” And he said, “me too!” But it was a new development at the time so it would have been a farm at the time he was in school. You had to be there, but it made me laugh.
This can have other reasons, which she is unable to tell. Like a constipation. 

She feels something, and her brain tells her, but it can't get it straight. The information gets mixed up. Forgetting they have eaten is common with dementia, but a number of things the people with dementia imagine do HAVE a cause. The trick is to find out, which is which.
My mom told me she gets her exercise climbing trees.
My mom did this too!  Was completely bizarre and we had to tease her and go with it!
You might want to look into enrolling your mom into the one of the phase 3 trials for simufilam. According to [this article](https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2021/11/biotechnology-brings-new-approach-and-fresh-hope-to-alzheimers-research.html), simufilam has shown great promise.

Alzheimers,Need input on Home Hunting,"So I'm looking into memory care for my dad. He has difficulty speaking (was weirdly the first thing to go) needs help dressing, keeping on top of his hygiene, and obviously making sure to eat. He's still very mobile but obvious can get confused easily. He doesn't wander but who knows if that would change in a new place.

Money shouldn't be a problem as I'm currently paying out the ass for home care and it will end up cheaper to move him.

My questions are, what have been your experiences with the more standard nursing home vs the more residential based care homes? Also how much one on one time can be expected? Will someone make sure he gets his meals and does activities? Do they limit how many personal items a person can have? How do you tell when a place is giving you an honest set of expectations vs bullshit?

I know it's different for every place but I'm interested to hear personal experiences.","The answer to all of these is that you have to visit, and to visit the closed dementia wards as well as the shiny open facilities.   Eat the food.   Ask for references from other children of residents.   

I regret to say that the more you pay, the better chance you'll have of getting good care, and that paying a lot isn't necessarily enough.   All of those questions you are asking will have to be asked of each separate home, because each separate home will have different policies.

The only way to know (some) of what is going on is to ask to sit, quietly, in the ward your dad will be in, and watch what is happening.   Does it smell like urine?  Are all the people parked in recliners watching TV?  Are the scheduled activities actually happening?   You can't tell any of those from the outside, or from the brochures.

I will say that both my parents and my in-laws were in progressive housing, where you moved from cottages to apartments to varying levels of assisted living.   My MIL's apartment was wonderful and charming.   When she had to move to an actual ward, it was hideous; she was kept to a specified schedule, and they acted as if they were doing her a favor by assigning her to a table (assigned seats!) with people who could still talk.  She was physically limited, not mentally, but the only tier past an independent apartment was mostly demented patients.

My mother's community's dementia ward was sunny, had activities, had lots of things to do, but.  She wouldn't eat the food.  Hated it.   And when I spent time there, I realized that most of the residents sat in recliners in front of the TVs, which were always on, all day.   There was no way to keep the wanderers out of an individual bedroom.   The bedrooms off the ward were in units of two separated by a curtain; there was no privacy.

My brother took care of all the research for moving her after COVID.  That involved online research, then individual visits and asking a lot of pointed questions.   Mother's dementia has progressed, but she's happy, eating well, and being taken care of.
My experiences. Tour a lot and ask to see their policy handbook.  All of them have activities directors that make sure residents are engaged as much as they want to me. Nurses or aides always made sure my mom was brought to the dining room or brought a meal to her room if she refused to leave.

The first place we moved my mom to had a $5k move-in fee (non-refundable), the place was fantastic, great meals (we got to eat there for free regularly while she adjusted), and the nurses and aides seemed great. Then a week into it, I got a call that she was threatening to kill herself (I'd warned them about that and that it was depression talking and she was on meds for it, so they were aware), and that I needed to go spend the night with her.  A week later, she escaped as door alarms never went off. Two weeks later, she escaped again and was found walking in the snow in 20 degree F weather with no coat and only slippers. They asked us to move her out, we lost the $5k move-in fee, which felt unfair since they said they were well equipped for wandering and redirection. That place was unfurnished, so we had to supply everything.

The second place was more expensive, but they were fantastic with her. She did escape once, but the chef came out and asked her if she wanted to walk around the gardens with him. Once they were done, she happily went back inside with him to have coffee and cookies. Eventually at $7000 a month, we were running out of money and she had to apply for Medicaid and private pay for a year before most places would even put her on their waitlist. Again, it was unfurnished, so we supplied everything.

That brings me to her first Medicaid place. That's where I learned that state laws, a locked wing only means the door is locked until you push it rapidly 10 times and then for fire codes it automatically opens. My mom was happy to shove on that door. When nurses tried to stop her she apparently flipped out and started swinging. I got called to the ER where she'd been chemically sedated as she attacked the EMTs when they were called to help. I got to the ER and she was calm and just happy to see me. A day later, I got another call that she'd been left in another hospital and the memory care community refused to take her back. The ER needed to know what I wanted to do now. It took a month and she was moved out of state as my state apparently lacks Alzheimer's care with 24/7 skilled nurses. That place was fully furnished and all she was allowed to bring were 7 pairs of underwear/socks/shirts/pants, jackets/hats/mittens/gloves, and three pairs of shoes/boots.

The new place is okay. They definitely are a little lax in areas regarding COVID, which has led to another outbreak and now visits are all canceled for at least the month. That's frustrating to me as it's a three hour drive to see her, so we already weren't able to see her often. I knew it was going to happen though as the weekend desk person and nurses allowed people to enter without masks, and that was just asking to have the virus brought in. This one is also furnished and they've been great at letting us know what she'd want, which now is really just slippers, pajamas/loungewear, and pictures.
What level of care are you looking at?

Independent and assisted living is more similar to moving into a normal-ish apartment building with a hotel-style lobby, meals served in dining room, with activities and common areas in other rooms. You move your own furniture into an empty apartment unit with a kitchenette. 

For independent living, they do meds and bathe on their own but participate in the social activities and have access to help in an emergency. In assisted living, Aides come by to give medication, dress, and assist with bathing on a regular schedule. 

Many married couples with very different levels of need can share an apartment this way, where only one spouse needs help with bathing and meds and they socialize in the dining hall. Of course this was all before covid. 

In the suburbs of a major city, I've seen it structured as $7000 monthly for assisted living with more ADLs. I have also seen it structured like a condo where you purchase a share of a co-op at $100,000 or so and then pay a monthly ""HOA"" fee for the ongoing care. However it may be structured this way to avoid spousal impoverishment. I'm not sure exactly.

Nursing homes are typically skilled nursing facilities which is more intense 24/7 care.
I quit everything and moved in with her permanently. It’s tight, but we both live on her pension. I am doing as much as I can so she can stay at her home for as long as possible and not go into a care centre.
As someone who works as an aide, I can guarantee you that unless you get REALLY lucky,, one on one time will be extremely limited. 

Crazy short staffing everywhere, with nit much time to do anything else other than basic care. 

Facilities will lie to you and tell you their care plan is individualized,  but it's a load of BS. 

And I worked at a 5 star facility where most residents had a few million in the bank
If they make you make an appointment to see them  (non covid time of course) then run. Visiting hours are ok as long as they're basically the entire day. Even better if no restrictions.",2021-11-20 20:17:07,Reichiroo,qyjnzk
Alzheimers,Stubborn person unwilling to take a cognitive test,"Due to our past, I just can't even deal with her stubbornness. She digs her heals in on anything. I'm here to help, but I can't force her to take a cognitive test, though there are some signs of very weird behavior and confusion.

The first thing she brought up was that they ""take you away to a nursing home."" I tried to assure her, if that even happens, it would be for people who wander in the middle of the night and you find them across town. Nowhere near where she's at. 

I tried pushing the line of any just being ""elderly"", it's a good idea to get a baseline test. Reassuring that she's totally fine. Met with resistance, ""I don't need to do that."" 

She filed a police report about neighbors for, it's confusing, but I think using her youtube account to watch movies? She's focused on these neighbors a couple other times.

Not sure what to do really. Mostly she's all there, but I suspect something. But she's really resistant to getting any kind of cognitive test. My father has also noted concern about her, and himself too. I was hoping it could be a low-key ""everyone get a cognitive test because of age"" thing, but I was met with a lot of resistance. I tried presenting it as a ""You're fine, nobody's taking you to a nursing home, let's just get a baseline"" but it was met with a lot of resistance and shut down immediately.

Not really sure what to do.","You just make a doctor appointment for a physical or something and ask the doctor to ask her the questions without saying why he’s asking.  Always make sure the doc knows why you are coming in first before he sees the patient.  You can go into the exam room with the patient, excuse yourself to go to the bathroom and wait outside and talk to the doc before he goes in.  A big part of dealing with dementia is figuring out how to get the patient to comply (eat, drink, wash, exercise, take meds, everything else) without upsetting them.  It’s tricky.  Distraction is an art form w Dementia patients.  Good luck.
Anything else you can schedule a dr visit for? For my mom, ""headaches"" was what got her in the door and got the first cognitive test and MRI done.  And then, as other people have suggested, make sure the doctor's office knows what she's really there for. 

FWIW, we've found that senior-focused doctors tend to be very, very good at handling this type of issue.
So far you haven't given much detail about what you suspect.  Dementia?  Because the thing about the neighbors also sounds like paranoia, these are distinct things.  Is she also forgetful and showing confusion about how things work?  (One of our family doctors said, ""If you lose your keys, that's normal.  If you forget what keys are for, that's dementia."")

The way I first got my spouse assessed was to ""consult"" with a geriatrics clinic because he's on a boatload of meds and I wanted to know if they were appropriate for older adults, needed dose adjustments, etc.  A cognitive assessment was offered and I said sure, it would give us a baseline.  But I actually wasn't suspecting anything - my reason for taking him in was to consult about his meds!  Maybe a ruse like that would be helpful.",2021-11-18 22:51:52,salfkvoje,qx7kau
Alzheimers,My Dad has early onset - Looking for advice and/or commiseration,"I'm 27 y/o and my dad, who is 58 y/o, was formally diagnosed with early onset back in February. It's probably been about 3 years since he started having issues, and at first he was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. It's been hard. 

I really don't think my mum is coping well, she's always been one to take things out on other people and doesn't have a ton of patience. She's dealing with her elderly parents as well. That's not to say she isn't a wonderful and caring person, I just think a situation like this tends to exacerbate a person's less than great traits. 

My dad still drives, he's still self-sufficient, but he's been getting more and more confused lately. He's been a musician all my life and was in a duo when I was younger and has recorded two albums. He's always played with friends and has had jam nights, obviously less now due to COVID. The other night he was at a jam session at a friend's house, and he told me he just couldn't keep up and was really down about it. 

I guess I'm just looking for any advice, or even to talk to someone who is in a similar situation. Most support groups I've found are for caregivers or teens with a grandparent who has it. I guess I'm just trying to get a handle on what to expect, and if there's even any sort of rough timeline for this. I've just been thinking a lot lately about whether my dad will be around for my wedding or if he will get to meet my kids one day (I'm single, so it isn't like any of that is on the horizon). I like to have an idea of the process and next steps and what I can expect (I'm a lawyer, hazard of the trade). I just feel lost.

If you've made it this far, thank you, I really appreciate it. Just felt like I needed to get this off my chest.","This hits home. My dad was 64 when he was diagnosed. There are going to be a lot of tough days but also a lot of remarkable ones too. Go with the flow, be patient, and go easy on yourself. I recommend connecting with local groups for memory loss or creative aging. Things are easier when you have a community around you. We did a lot of activities together like going on walks, trips to the zoo, painting, music (btw music and ALZ have a very powerful therapeutic connection) Learn to enjoy those simple moments. Also caregiver support groups are really helpful too. 

Your dad will change a lot, and that can be really painful. I mourned for the father I lost, but I also learned to really love the man he became. As his memory faded and his skills deteriorated, I got to experience life in reverse. I was more a father and he was more a son. I drove him places, bought him ice cream, helped him shave, and played catch with him in the back yard. I saw my dad the way he saw me when I was a boy, and I felt honored to be able to give back all the love he gave to me. 

My dad passed earlier this year. I miss him every day, but I’m thankful for the time we got to spend together. In many ways, we grew closer because of ALZ. It’s a tough and painful road, but it is beautiful in its own way too. I wish you and your family strength for the journey ahead.
Wow this sounds like me and my situation. My dad was 57 when he was diagnosed in feb 2019 and was (is) a musician. Cant play anymore, cant drive, but still has his sense of humor. I can also relate on thinking about my future, how i want him to be a grandfather one day and him to be at my wedding.   He was recently diagnosed with CBS which is a form of dementia and Parkinson’s. Its really hard to see them realize they cant do things anymore. But i try and tell my dad to focus on the stuff he can still do. I find that when i still talk about music he lights up and he’ll just talk and talk. It makes me so happy to see him realize he still has those memories of concerts and how to play some of the music (even if he physically cant). Also know that the constant panic goes away. I was constantly having panic attacks when he was first diagnosed, and when im away from him i feel worse. When im with him its so much easier to enjoy the moment. (Also get a head start on finances, arrangements, wills etc as morbid as it may be…).  Feel free to reach out anytime just to vent or cry or ask questions. ♥️sending love
I feel ya my friend. My mom has early onset and is now living in a nursing home. I am 26 and quite frankly just feel too young to deal with it. Feel very sad if I think about how she won’t be able to come wedding dress shopping with me, help me get ready on the big day, be there for me if I ever have kids. Genuinely kind of tear up thinking about it. In a way, my mom is not my mom anymore and I feel like I have grieved her even though she isn’t physically dead. I want to say it gets better - but Alzheimer’s really is one of those diseases that just gets harder and harder to watch. I suppose a silver lining is that eventually your father won’t understand what’s going on. 

Highly recommend therapy if you’re not in it already. I felt every emotion under the sun about my mom and eventually snapped at work one day. Got a therapist that same day and it was very helpful in being able to vent and think about healthy coping mechanisms.
I’m in my late 30s. My mom passed away from it last year after at least a 10 year struggle (she fought the diagnosis tooth-and-nail). It’s good that you found out early. Alzheimer’s Association was a helpful resource for me to learn about the disease - they have a phone number for talking to someone too (I think 24/7). I also read Alzheimer’s for Dummies and the Chicken Soup for the Alzheimer’s Soul (short stories written by people who’ve experienced it). It was a rough road for my dad and me, but we made it and she’s at peace now. Love your dad as much as you can, keep him safe, be patient, take care of your health first, and find people to talk/vent to. 

You are not alone 💜
Very similar experience. I’m 25, dad was diagnosed several years ago when he was 56. I’ve thought about my own wedding often, and how big life events will look when my dad isn’t there. The biggest thing I can suggest is surrounding yourself with people who will listen to all the ups and downs. A therapist, friend, support group, etc. There are so many feelings that come with loving someone with Alz, and so many of them conflict. Since your dad is a musician, I’d recommend making sure to record some of your and his favorite songs so you’ll always have them to listen to
So is there anything that can be done? I'm in a similar situation. Is there a medicine or vitamin he can take to slow down the progress of it?
I recommend the caregiver support groups. Believe it or not, you are now a caregiver. The support group I attended at an Alzheimer's Association had folks who were caring for all sorts of family members - I was part of my mother's team - and at all stages of Alzheimer's. There were discussions about finances, medical care, home care, nutrition, family dynamics, memory care placements, Medicare, social workers, hospice, and exhaustion. Those folks really helped me better anticipate my mother's future needs and care. They were fun, encouraging people too.
Are you in the US? If so you need to help your parents arrange their finances so that by the time he needs significant help on a daily basis, he will qualify for Medicaid in-home aide services. otherwise your Mom erodes her own health sustaining his every need, or the adult children quit their jobs and do it, and/or the parents drain their whole life savings on it and there is nothing left to inherit.

You may also want to consider helping them move to a more accessible home: ideally within walking distance from the shops/downtown area. Please remember, a car is a deadly weapon. The cognitive abilities required to drive a car is a lot higher than you might think. People with dementia become unsafe to drive a car *long before* they become unsafe to simply walk around at the shops. And they will want to stay independent as long as possible. Anywhere that you can remove an obstacle where they will be required to ask for help to do something safely (cause they often refuse to, they resent the fact that they need you, and just try anyway) the better their life, your life, and your relationship will be.
Did he start taking a statin 3 years ago?
The other thing about moving to an accessible home: your dad is still early enough that he can form new muscle memories in a new home.  OR if his home is mostly accessible, start thinking about remodeling work now. Especially for the bathroom, it's easier to design a new bathroom remodel with extra studs in the wall for grab bars and curbless showers and nonslip floors, compared to adding them later after a crisis. And with a remodel, or searching for a new accessible flat for them, you can actually make it fun if you do it on your own terms.

Oftentimes people think ""no, he's not at that point yet, he's not bad enough yet to move to a new home or get POA""

But dementia is not a slow and steady decline with lots of warning signs. Usually they get along by themselves relatively fine, until a crisis happens and they suddenly and drastically lose capacity. And getting a POA or moving to a new home are both done best on your own terms, your own schedule, done thoughtfully.

For my grandmother it was when she got shingles. She was hospitalized, had to learn how to walk again, and never got back to where she was before. It was at this point we started to realize just how much of a mess her finances were. That was back in 2016.
Get both medical and durable power of attorney. Get pass words. Located important papers like life insurance and car titles. Get on his bank accounts. Apply for SSI and Medicade. At some point you will need double keyed deadbolts to keep him for escaping.
I understand. I'm 39. My dad got diagnosed with cognitive brain impairment in 2017 when he was 66. It is hard. Some parts of his personality have changed. He used to be the technology director of a school district. He helped all of us with computers and technology. Now we have to help him. He still can cook and drive and do low-stress things independently.

However that is also from my mom's feedback. My mom goes back and forth with acceptance. Sometimes she says she's really stressed out when he loses things, makes mistakes, or accidentally breaks things, etc., and other times she says he's really great. She's having a hard time too. She worked with the elderly as an occupational therapist, so she has work experience but it's different when it's your own family. My main concern is that he and my mom are safe. 

The one positive from my dad's personality change is he wants to be happy and carefree. He wants to joke and do fun things. He's very focused on enjoying life and it makes be happy he can do this with my mom while he can. 

I've done some research on local Alzheimer's support where I live. Where do you live? I can try to help to help to find resources depending on where you are. I'm in California, USA, so I'm most familiar with this area. 

Good luck and you are not alone at all in this.
You got this , if you need support you should speak with a social worker. They know about all types of organizations and support groups that are there to help.",2021-11-18 20:57:17,FluffyAlligator17,qx5f9g

Alzheimers,How do you deal with frustration while Caregiving?,,"I'm not the sole caretaker in my home so I am not sure if my advice will be helpful. I am the only one caretaker during the day though. When the other gets home from work, I will occasionally take off somewhere. Doesn't matter where: restaurant, movie, just going for a drive, just going for a walk. The time to myself is so much more important than what I do with that time.
I do the same as other OP, take off somewhere outside.  And find ways to laugh as much as possible about the insanity resulting from
this horrible disease!
Drink water, take a walk, ugly cry in shower, scream into a pillow
Stepping away for a few minutes, as long as your loved one is safe.  Get away even for a short time - I will take a little walk around the yard, or take a quick hot shower... sit in the car and listen to the radio for a bit...  I know this is so hard.  So ridiculously hard.
You have to take breaks sometime. It will wear away at even the most patient people. Even just 15-30 min of quiet time (or whatever it may be to help you relax) to yourself will go a long way.
Have a good breakfast ages before they wake up and at least half an hour in their comfy chair after they’ve gone to bed :)
Likely not too helpful, but I’ll share anyway. My mom is solidly at mid level 6 and just clogged the toilet with a pair of undies (third time so far). I’m trying to finish a degree and have had hives for the last three weeks. We are currently at a hotel with an indoor pool a 1 1/2 hrs away from the house; puppy is at daycare.  I’m still failing two classes, the house still needs to be cleaned, I still have a million things to do and calling a plumber has to be the first thing I do tomorrow afternoon. It’s been nice to get away and mum has been loving it. Im surprised how good I feel And how much less pressure I feel right now. Aside from this random experience I use headphones (def in the car when she won’t stop talking) and get daycare a few times a week.
Here are my tips. Not all are equally doable, this is what I found helps. 

1) try to share the load. My dad has Alzheimer’s. My mom is the main caretaker but we all live together (my husband and kids too). My sister lives about 30 min away but comes over often.

2) have stuff to look forward too. I try to plan breaks and vacations for my mom to break up the daily monotony of being retired and at home with my dad all day. 

3) be social. My mom does social stuff anyway. It’s super awkward seeing old friends who haven’t seen my dad in a while but my mom does it anyway. His progress is shocking and horrible. But being isolated is terrible for the caregiver. It’s also nice having kids around the house because they give my mom love and hope for the future. 

4) take breaks. Go for a walk by yourself sometimes. Even running errands alone can be a reprieve from the sick. Spend longer than you need on the toilet. 

5) don’t feel guilty. Forgive yourself if you are mean by accident. The Alzheimer’s patient will likely forget anyway honestly. Forgive yourself for being resentful or angry sometimes.
Hard. My wife is an only child.all of my imediate family are overseas.

It is me (60M) and the wife (72F).

The wife is forgetful but can function at home, hygine wise.

Being blind is an added challenge.

I'm her carer 24/7.

It is hard, but we have always done things together and this has not changed.

I have to be calm and put on a brave face, but inside I am dreading the end time.

Financially we are secure, so this is one less worry.

We've been married since 1985 and this brings me the greatest comfort that we are still together as best friends forever.",2021-11-18 11:34:09,YaadMemoryBook,qwtmck
Alzheimers,Can a head injury make Alzheimer’s worse?,"My father has early onset Alzheimer’s. For the most part, other than irritability and forgetfulness, he’s still functioning very well right now. 

He was on a horse today and the saddle wasn’t on correctly and he fell off. Some facial numbness, short term blurry vision and not remembering the fall came right after. He’s on the way to the hospital to get checked out now for a concussion and everything. 

My question is will this affect his Alzheimer’s or make it worse in any way?","It is hard to say & I don't know about a head injury, but we saw sharp declines following events that were experienced as traumatic & scary (falls, MRIs, etc.) It evened out after a few days, but was definitely part of the downward trajectory.
Not sure about Alzheimer's specifically but theres studies about how traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for dementia, even later in life.  https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/dementia-head-injury
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33687142/
Honestly it really depends person to person how fast or slow decline will happen. Sometimes trauma can cause a decline for a few days and then they go back to the baseline they were at. Sometimes, however, it causes a decline that becomes their new baseline. Just make sure his caregiver is keeping an eye on him for the next couple days for any cognitive changes.
My gran fell over a few months ago and had to get stitches in her head. I Haven’t seen any significant changes.
My mothers decline started after a car accident in which she was not wearing a seat belt and nearly put her own head through a windshield. It was a couple years later that I started seeing the decline. 

On the other hand her own father had dementia/Alzheimer’s so while I don’t think one or the other is the sole cause I do believe that both contributed in some way. 

I am 45 and have been dealing with non-injury related neurological issues/TBI type stuff for 5 years now. I’m am scared to death for my children having to deal with this in me knowing that I am at a much higher risk already. I have made decent progress in recovering but there’s still clearly some issues I deal with daily. 

The plus side is that I have first hand experience and can relate to my own mothers issues/feeling. While she will never improve she does find comfort in having someone who explains thoughts/feelings in a way she can understand.
These weren't head injuries, but what I've found after my mom broke her wrist and another fall where she whacked her hip in a fall, her anger greatly increased. The same thing happened with a UTI. So, you may find that he becomes more difficult, angry, agitated due to the pain.",2021-11-17 19:06:30,SimplyPeachy92,qwcoa5

Alzheimers,I need help,"My grandma recently got alzheimer, how can i deal with it?
Im not the most patient person in the world, and it is getting to my nerves she askin the same thin 4 times a day and every day, forgeting all the medicinrs she has to take and lot more things, do you guys have some advice? 
I'm young and don't want to throw my life away tsking care of her full time.","It’s so hard to deal with. And it gets worse. This is nothing compared to when they start yelling at you at hitting you . Ask for help, and take breaks from her
Are your parents or any other family around? You sound quite young - do you live alone with your grandma?
A couple of items that we found helpful for mom:

1. A clock with BIG numbers and letters that tells the day, year and what time it is am/pm.

2. A circular pill dispenser that you can set alarms. When it's time to take pills the cover rotates to the pills to be taken and beeps until it is tipped over and the pills dumped out.  This only works if their hearing is somewhat decent and they are in the area of the pill dispenser. They can't access any pills other than the current dose so they don't mistakenly double down on medication.  At the very least we would hear the alarm and remind mom to take her pills.

I think I found both of them on Amazon. We had a home health care nurse come in once a week and fill her pill dispenser because she didn't trust anyone in the family to do it. It's possible you can get a pill dispenser with a 2nd tray and have the pharmacy fill it for your.

I know caring for someone with Alzheimers is emotionally exhausting so take care of yourself and be sure to make time to decompress if you can.
Time to learn some maturity, patience and compassion.  If you're so young surely this is not on you.  Your gran can't help what's happening to her brain and answering the same question FOUR times in a day is nothing.  Your Gran is only going to get worse.  Surely SHE loves YOU and has done all your life.  Time to return some of that love.
In the united states there are non profits and volunteer organizations, and some times government help. You could try to look up a little bit about if theres similar help in Brazil. Sometimes in the united states, theres free support groups, where you can talk about your worries, but it is also a way get information about what kind of help is available to you, from other people who maybe live near by and also have Alzheimer's in the family.

Alzheimer's Association is based in America, but they have some presence in other countries. I can't tell how much they offer but maybe you can find something helpful https://www.alz.org/br/dementia-alzheimers-en.asp
https://abraz.org.br/2020/
The second link might be old, but it does show some support groups could exist. 
Sorry if not helpful, good luck.
 Contact ALZ.org (they have a 24/hr phone line). Also there are agencies you can work with to have people come out and care for her (can get expensive).

When it comes to talking with her, always remember she is in another world now. Words mean different things to her. Does she like TV? You can put that on and try to get her attention set there.
The way you deal with it is stop trying to expect her to do things like before. Assume she won't remember to take her own meds, assume she won't remember everything you explain, or learn new skills. Get in the habit of writing reminders for her like sticky notes everywhere for things she forgets. If she keeps tripping over the same spot, you try to eliminate the hazard rather than tell her not to trip. If she keeps getting some fact wrong, re-consider how important it is really for her to get it correct vs feel like she's correct, or diverting her to another topic. It's a different way of viewing the world, and it's really hard since it requires having a foot in both real world and makebelieve world being being her buffer. Sometimes you can try to have fun with it by giving her silly but comforting answers to questions she asks over and over if there is no consequence. Or if she insists on some problem (even if it doesn't exist), you tell her you're going to go deal with it (instead of telling her it doesn't exist) and come back telling her it's resolved.
I don't know how well it operates in Portuguese but an Alexa device could be helpful; both for answering frequent questions about the day, time, weather, what time the store closes, how long from now is some holiday, but also for the reminder functions, and the ability to yell for help and call family from afar if she fell and can't stand up",2021-11-17 10:36:28,anthoneco2,qw1w6a
Alzheimers,How long to get into a home,"My dad (58) has been progressively getting worse. He's always been verbally abusive to me, my mom and my sister. I know for anyone who has a loved one with Alzheimer's, it often makes the person irritable, verbally abusive and even aggressive to a point where they don't recognize their loved one anymore. For us, it seems to just amplify what was already there, with the addition of having conservations with himself, wandering, and unable to toilet himself. My mom has a caretaker while she's at work and she's paying out of pocket for that. We are in NJ. She has been trying for a place since August/September. The first 2 homes turned him down because he needs a nursing home and NOT assisted living, which they were. TO be honest, I didn't know there was a difference at first. My dad is becoming more verbally aggressive and was screaming and cursing all day. He was never physical before but now we are super concerned it will get worse. He also randomly starts dancing in between the screaming, it looks almost manic.

&#x200B;

Is there a way to get an emergency check in at a nursing home that can handle him? We can't officially apply for Medicaid until a place takes him and some places wont take him while it is pending. Are there any other emergency options?","They are not going to keep him if he's aggressive and combative. And once he's ""kicked out"" of one place it makes it much harder to find another that will take him. I strongly recommend you get the aggression under control now. He may need a stay in a geriatric psychiatric ward. That would be the emergency option. From there (once he's stabilized), the hospital social worker can find a suitable facility to transfer him to for long term care and help you with the Medicaid process. If your Mom isn't working with an elder law attorney, now is the time to talk to one since this affects her finances as well.
I'm in Vermont. Many places told us they had a waitlist of at least a year. One had a five-year waitlist. Places that would eventually accept Medicaid often refused us flat out saying current residents in need of the memory care wing took priority and they had too many of them. 

My mom broke her wrist and attacked at least four people that I know of. The last memory care she was in drove her to the ER and left her at check-in. They didn't even call me. She stayed in the hospital for a month before the social worker there found her placement out of state in a place with 24-hour nurses. My state doesn't have many nursing homes with Alzheimer's wings that handle anger/aggression. It's insane that families all over have to go through this, yet it's pretty common.

The other issue is that many of these places are facing COVID outbreaks, so they're taking precautions over bringing in new people. Making someone with dementia quarantine to their room is impossible. That's one of the reasons my mom was able to get in. She'd done a month-long quarantine in the hospital wing.

The only way we were able to do all this was by specifically stating she was a danger to herself and others and that it was unsafe to bring her into either of our homes. That helped the social worker find placement outside of bouncing her back to us.
I'd speak with his neurologist. If it is that bad the doctor can have him admitted to a psychiatric ward and then they work from there to find permanent care. 

Is he on any kind of anti-psychotic or mood stabilizer? My dad wasn't as bad as yours is, but they put him on Seroquel when his mood started getting all over the place and it seems to have helped.
We moved my mother from a memory care facility to a board and care facility. Memory care was just not set up for the personal assistance my mother required. The board and care facility was wonderful. Ask his doctor for the name of a local social worker who can help your mother narrow down her placement options, and perhaps also apply for disability/social security assistance. Social workers are amazing. Also look around for your nearest Alzheimer's Association. They have lists of local services and have support groups with folks who are and have worked through just this sort of thing. It's free.  

It sounds like your father may require further evaluation as well, for medication to treat his aggressiveness and physically acting out. Best wishes.
I thank you both for your replies! She is working with an elder care lawyer that has been making calls for her daily. It’s crazy how people can be denied for aggression and issues that are part of what Alzheimer’s is. I thought the that was the point of memory care/nursing homes.
How long has he been especially aggressive? If it was a sudden change I would get him tested for a UTI. Can a doctor prescribe him Prozac and/or seroquel?",2021-11-16 14:17:12,rge703,qvflrv
Alzheimers,Advice needed.,"This is a difficult question, and may not fit with the group/might offend someone and I apologize in advance, it’s not intentional. 
I need an opinion on something and I’m not sure the right group of people to ask, I thought someone here might have an opinion/advice to offer. Sorry for the length. TLDR at the end 

So my mum was diagnosed a few years ago, she has early onset and is now 66. She’s pretty much a toddler at this point, has little short term memory etc. My dad is her primary and she’s on the list for LTC, she was actually accepted to one faster than he was expecting, so turned it down, he wasn’t ready and she’s not at the point where she needs to be in a home just yet. We’re thinking she will be there in a year or so. 
The last few years of not having my mum in my life, specifically because of COVID, but also because she’s not calling me or being super involved in family things like she used to, because obviously she can’t, has made it incredibly clear how much of a negative impact my mother was on my life and mental health. As I’ve worked to improve many aspects of my life, get myself medicated properly for my depression and anxiety as well as being recently diagnosed with ADHD (making so much of my life and childhood make sense finally) I’ve looked back on my childhood and the memories I have of my mother are truly awful. I’ve come to the realization that she was a massive narcissist, and unfortunately, I was her target. My older sister was her favourite and I realized that all the abuse I received from my sister was learned and groomed from my mother. My saving grace in all this is that my sister grew out of it and she and I are best friends now. She has addressed her behaviour from when we were kids many times over and I have forgiven and we have grown so much closer together. She received some of my mothers narcissism when she had her own kids (mostly because I was older and she could no longer get to me) and that pulled us together, because I could help and support her. I told my sister stories from when I was younger, things that she did to me that either she was unaware of or that she remembers, but having it put in perspective from an adult looking back, has horrified her. 
So my issue is this. I’m having a very difficult time feeling any empathy towards my mother, to the point that I want little to do with her. I’m very supportive of my dad and want to help him where I can, but I’m struggling even looking at it trying to talk to my mum. All I feel is anger and resentment when I look at her.
My question, should I sit down and talk to my dad about this? My sister and I have a really good relationship with him. I feel like I need to let him know where I’m at and why. But I don’t want to offload more stress on him. I know that he feels bad about the missed ADHD diagnosis, as I struggled my whole life not knowing what was wrong with me and if they had actually been hands on parents they may have caught it when I was a kid. 
As caregivers, what would you think is a good direction to go? Is this too much to put on someone’s plate who already has a lot? 
TLDR: my mother screwed me up and I’m having issues feeling empathy for her/wanting to help her. Don’t know if I should let my dad know what’s going on.","Hmm im not normally this schemey when it comes to familial relationships but maybe your sister could subtly talk to your dad about it first, in relation to her own (apparently more limited, and hopefully less upsetting) experience of her narcissism. This would be to get a feel for his awareness of her behavior, and how receptive he would be to acknowledging it and maybe helping you guys heal about it. Maybe hes even been a recipient of the abuse himself but it was hidden from you two. But maybe your sister would do better with keeping it together when bringing it up. Shed also maybe be able to wrap the topic up more smoothly if its very upsetting to dad, assuming shes less troubled by it.

Then you can consider if you want to go in to it more with your dad. 

If you decide not to though, all is not lost. Try to focus on the idea of supporting him, not her. There is often some point where it can be difficult for a lot of people to ""empathize"" with an Alzheimer's person because they will be so far gone, and you won't know whats going on in their heads. Its not super nice to consider, but the role really can become truly  custodial. But the caregiver could always use the support and empathy, even as they care for a person they may think is no longer even there. 

In any case, you're not alone. I have seen a few other posts in this sub where a spouse or child of an alz pt had to be a caregiver to a formerly (or currently) abusive patient.
I'm currently caring for my dad and he was not my favorite person. He's the source of a lot of body issues and self esteem problems I have. A lot of my brother and I's caregiving for him really is just coming from a sense of duty as his children (our mom died a long time ago). It actually helps a lot that his personality is completely different now... he's a bit more childlike which makes it easier to be empathetic and leave the past in the past... for now.

Your dad is most likely pretty burnt out being the primary caregiver even if he doesn't show it. He probably feels a lot of resentment for your mom's current condition and guilt for feeling that way about his spouse. If it was me, I don't know that I'd have the emotional capacity to deal with another person's feelings at this time to the degree they needed. If he's been asking why you're not being helpful, it's probably a necessary conversation, but honestly... he's probably aware to some degree. 

Maybe talk with your sister first (or a therapist if you currently have one) and look for ways you can support your dad without feeling like you're doing it for your mom. In the end, your healing will have to come from within because, unfortunately, you won't be able to confront your mother about it as she's not the same person anymore.
Waaa, sorry for all that, it's hard.  I have mum with Alzhms, and older sister with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, so yeh umm I'm somewhat aware of the conditions & so on.  Horrendous - so sorry, OP, I feel for you!    Hmm, yeh Idk....  Yes, yr dads sister might be a good sounding board.

For a start, your dad, being older generation, he's likely not really aware of narcissism as an abusive disorder/condition, also has his own set of dynamics with yr mom regarding that - he was probably like a froggy in a pot of heating water.  Same as back when we were kids diagnosing of many conditions in child psychology wasn't really a common thing either.

If you bring it all to him of a sudden, it might even blow his mind.  Maybe would he feel complicit, that he 'failed' you..?..    Will he discover that he also suffered narc abuse for decades from someone he's now caring for, and that his wife was abusing his children..?.. Narcissists, they don't just target one person - everybody suffers.  Sure some are particular / favourite targets, but nobody near a narc gets off scott-free.  So hmm yeh, I'd approach it very carefully I think, if I cared about my dad.

I suppose a therapist / counsellor can help you with that, how you want to navigate / approach it.  Have you ever seen r/raisedbynarcissists ?   It probably will be helpful to you.  Down the right side of the page they also have < resources >  and  < RBN network & allies >...

It's wonderful to hear that your sister is not a narc, has amended her behaviour & that you both are friends, also that you are seeking therapy & healing.  Yeh, support yr dad, try get yr mom into residential care sooner rather than much later - better for yr mom, sure better for yr dad, & you all.  Help yr dad accept that it's inevitable anyways.

Best of luck with it all!

edit - also r/NarcissisticAbuse down the right side has < resources > and < reading material . .  That sub is for partners of intimate abuse, but narcs are narcs - the tactics tricks techniques & healings are still same, the resources & reading material still stand very useful.
Man, I don't know if there's much to be gained by sharing all that with your dad.  I'm tempted to say, leave him out of it but continue to be supportive of him.  At most, I would say you could tell him you felt mistreated by your mom and now it's hard to have much empathy.  Like your sister was, he may have been oblivious to much of what she did and said to you.

Therapy is a safer place to unburden.

Alzheimers,Gift for Dad,"My dad (69) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about a year ago. He was a psychiatrist before he retired, so he’s very hard on himself and knows what’s coming better than any of us. To me, he still appears fine. He’s very well spoken and smart, just slightly mixed up about unimportant things. He’s always been forgetful. Recently, however, he’s given up reading and driving and said he feels like he has no life. He’s struggling with audio books and word games. I’d like to get him something, either now or for Xmas, that he can enjoy. The only thing he really does is watch TV (though his wife says it’s hard for him to follow sometimes) and gardening, but it’s getting to be cold and less enjoyable. Anything I can get him that he can do long term to fill up the day, and won’t have to give up for a long time? Especially something that makes him feel “proactive” with the illness? I live far away, but I’d be willing to start a similar hobby or activity from where I am so he has someone to talk to about it. I’ve thought about learning a language with him, but he wants to learn Polish and that’s just too hard for me at the moment. He also seems to start and stop hobbies out of frustration. But maybe something like that, to build his confidence? 
Thanks!!!","[deleted]
Anything creative or expressive. Any hobby he ever had or considered. 

I think learning Polish would be too hard for both of you and potentially very frustrating for him.
Karaoke machine with old songs he loves (esp his teens thru 30s, and then anything else you think he like). Get a good setup and speakers so he can listen and sing along while he gardens outside. And then when he cant go out you can do video call karaoke with him. Maybe he can even learn new songs as a mental exercise type thing, while he is capable.
I found documentaries were good with my dad. They speak to the audience directly, which made him feel included, and they were educational. He liked ones about rock and roll history especially.

Doing puzzles would also help.
Puzzles
My mom was similar.  She was a microbiologist and her hobbies were genealogy and reading historical books.  She loved having intellectual conversations.  It was a struggle to find fulfilling activities for her.  Playing her favorite music helped.  I wish I could've gotten her to try abstract painting.  It doesn't have rules and doesn't require too much dexterity.  She did enjoy going to private exercise classes with her best friend.
Can you switch gears here and look for a physical skill instead of a mental one.  Any chance your dad would be willing to take up running or some other activity with you that will result in increased blood flow to the brain and relief from boredom that isn’t complicated.

Any chance he would go to concerts with you or take singing lessons?
My dad was a doctor, so I relate to this post strongly. He has really enjoyed caring for indoor plants, filling and watching bird feeders in the yard, and watching National Geographic documentaries. The ones about animals are easy to follow and have beautiful photography, if he’s into that! He’s also played around with painting small wooden figures (bird feeders, cars, etc).
My dad likes coloring. I found a coloring book of birds that had paintings on one side so he could follow the colors. He likes it a lot
Jigsaw puzzles perhaps?  with appropriate number of pieces and not too complicated subjects?",2021-11-15 22:18:52,Odd-Acanthocephala6,quy435
Alzheimers,Alzheimers and long term care insurance,"My parents have long term care insurance, and my dad has Alzheimers.  In order to trigger the long term care insurance, we need certification that he needs substantial assistance from another individual in 2 or more ADLs (Activities of Daily Living).  If you asked him, he doesn't think he does, but if you ask Mom she says otherwise.  But we are talking about the more borderline things... like cooking.    He can still shower and all that kind of stuff on his own.  But can't remember where he is often.

Anyone have any experience triggering long term care insurance?  Can you say how hard or easy it was?

Thanks","I’m sure every policy is different.  When my mom needed adult day care, there was a nurse that came and did her initial assessment.  Then she came back every year or so to make sure she wasn’t cured and didn’t need the care anymore.  Eventually she of course escalated to full time care needed at the same nursing home.  

Maybe the paperwork has some information? We also found that the Alzheimer’s association was very helpful in navigating services and problems.
You could try talking with a social worker from a hospital. I know after my dad had a fall they had someone come to the house to observe his ability to get around the house and such.
My mom did indeed have to be certified by the insurance company's nurse, but she had a number of ADLs she needed help with, much further along than your dad. Plus she lived alone (though in a independent living unit in a retirement community). I remember for sure she was unable to handle her finances, unable to handle her medications, and was hit and miss about eating (she had one meal a day in the dining room).

She's now in memory care full time. We didn't have a nurse visit last year (for obvious reasons), and not yet this year, though she's just now coming up on her second anniversary of moving in.

Keep in mind that most LTC insurance has a waiting period. For us it was 90 days, where we had to pay her long term care expenses before insurance reimbursement kicked in.
Handling his own finances, and managing handling his own medications are two big ones. Ask your mom to try to notice exactly what gaps she needs to fill in on a daily basis. Maybe he tries to walk outside without shoes or a cost. Other things he would attempt if she didn't remind him.

Has he walked away from a boiling pot or left the stove on after leaving the house?",2021-11-15 20:13:54,modern_medicine_isnt,quvn0c
Alzheimers,New study suggests Alzheimer’s could be vaccinated against,,"Just wondering if anyone here who knows more about the current state of Alzheimer’s research has seen this article or the underlying research and can comment on it.

I’m curious about how big a deal this really is. I know there have been a lot of false starts with treatments/cures for Alzheimer’s. Is this something we should be excited about?
Alzheimer’s researcher here - big emphasis on the fact that this is NOT in humans and preliminary in mouse modes. 

Also just a reminder to always critique the sources. Something actually notable won’t be paywalled lol. 

While we are making progress, the title sensationalizes this and takes advantage of the fact that we all very much want more treatment options
It's pretty exciting to hear that they're ready to take it to a human trial.  It's important to remember that many pharmaceuticals fail in human trials even if they work in other animals.
""If we target the amyloid the dementia will go away."" Same thing we've been trying for the last 40 years and it hasn't worked yet.
Mouse models, doesn't cassava sciences have a drug in phase 3 trials that appeared to improvements in humans in phase 2?
Does anyone know how far along they are with their human trials, if they’ve even commenced? How fo you suppose this will affect the biotech companies who already have AD drug candidates in human trials…not apples to apples, obviously, but if they have a vaccine, what would the need be for the LLY, BIIB, ANVS, SAVA, or AVXL drugs in trials? NOTE: Dad was diagnosed with AD three years ago, so this is strictly for information, although I fo hold small positions in all of the aforementioned companies.

Alzheimers,"What are some good games/activities for a group of older people with dementia/Alzheimer's, indoor and sitting down?","Hi! I am currently working in a recreation department at a nursing home. I entertain and play with a group of people with dementia and/or alzheimer, ranging from around 75 to 98 years old. We're usually 12 to 15, all of them sitting on couches in the shape of half a circle. They never get up during the activities.

I'd like new ideas for activities I could do with them. Drawing/writing doesn't work, and they don't really like it. They want to move, think, have fun.

I'm not a fan of singing songs or reading stories, but at moments there are guests that do so. I almost always put music in the background of my activities too","When my mom was in one memory care community, a few activities were far more popular with others. They were in the 40 to 80 range mostly, so a little younger. One was a paint and sip. They'd actually get sparkling white grape juice, plastic wine glasses, and the supplies. The people loved it and would always ask for a top up of ""champagne.""

Nerf ball basketball or crumpled up paper with a wastebasket was popular. The maintenance guy usually held the basket and walked in front of each person. They played a magnet fishing game a similar way with a magnet and items in a bucket of water. Each one would have a score written on it that corresponded with the number of candies they could take from the prize basket. The activities director always had prizes for everyone who joined, too. She'd have a basket with prizes and let everyone pick their prize from that.

Alzheimers,The care home that mum's in has seven active cases of covid-19 and I don't know how to feel about it.,"Obviously I hope that everyone in the home who has it is ok but other than that, I don't know how to feel.

Mum doesn't have it and she's been double vaccinated, and other than her Alzheimer's she's in pretty good health (she's only 64). Part of me hopes, well, I don't know if ""hopes"" is the word I'm looking for... part of me feels like it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if she got it and passed from it, because she's confused and anxious and stressed all the time and this would be a much kinder way to go than however many months or years she has left with the Alzheimer's. 

But it feels so awful and selfish to think like that about your own mother whom you love and miss dearly and are actively grieving for.

I'm really struggling with how I'm feeling to the point where I just feel numb because I can't figure it out.","I think is is actually a pretty common thing to think an earlier end to alz would be easier on both the patient and the caregivers, however that end comes. The guilt and shame for thinking like that too is pretty common, it seems.

And then when they do pass away, we feel relieved.. And then sometimes feel bad for how much of a relief it is.

Don't beat yourself up over it, either way. You're not alone.
This is very common. My mom's memory care community has 9 confirmed patient cases, 3 confirmed staff cases, and 10 more patients showing symptoms. If I got the call my mom had it, I know I'd say no treatment. Her advance directive says no treatments for serious infections in the late stages. 

But, I am also mad that it got to this. The last time I was able to visit in October, a family of around 15 came in and told the on-duty front desk person that they'd been given permission to hold a pizza party. None were in masks, many said they refused to be vaccinated, none of them had been tested prior to their visit, and they all claimed they'd been told they didn't have to do any of this to hold the pizza party. The front desk person couldn't get hold of the director to ask if their story was true. The party was allowed to take place. I figured with lax measures like this happening, it was only a matter of time.
We've been there. My mother had Type 2 Diabetes and had had a stroke, so her Alzheimers spread quite quickly; she went from diagnosis to death in 16 months, instead of 10 years like her mother. It was a curse and a mercy.
It's ok to feel that way. I sometimes feel the same. I don't want my dad to suffer anymore as he has zero quality of life. His body is just hanging on but his mind is long-since gone.
I often feel it would be a blessing, if she went into a coma and slipped away... As of right now, she keeps injuring herself and survives but suffers through hospitalization and rehab totally angry and disoriented, coming out with more limitations each time... which she forgets about and injuries herself more and they cascade on each other.
I know that feeling.   And it is awful, but it's completely natural.

For myself, I know how much my mother hated the early part of dementia.  She's more contented now, but I'm in floods of tears every time I call her.   She would have hated where she is intellectually so much, so very much.

Shoot me, but I'd be grateful if she died comfortably.   Then I could finish mourning.",2021-11-15 11:12:53,TubbyLittleTeaWitch,qujwvs
Alzheimers,What should I do? Tell them or not?,"I’m staying with my grandparents to help care for my grandmother while my grandfather recovers from a hip replacement. Her nurse mentioned that soda is linked to Alzheimer’s and I did some research and see it clearly is. My grandmother drinks almost nothing but soda all day. And always has. I want to tell my grandfather that I want her drinking other things because it’s known to cause and make Alzheimer’s worse. Should I not say this to him though? I don’t want to upset him and have him thinking they’ve been messing up all this time. But he is the type that would prefer to know truth and not be Sheilds to protect feelings. Is it okay to say “grandpa, I think we should have grandma not drink as much soda, as it is known to cause and worsen Alzheimer’s.”
None of my other grandparents were soda drinkers and they’re all sharp as a tack and close to 90. The only other person I’ve known with Alzheimer’s was a woman who got it at 65 and obsessively drank soda. Is it worth telling him? I worry it might not be worth it since she’s so far gone already and it might make him feel like they did it to themselves","As folks get older they can get dehydrated quickly so that works be there only reasoning to dial back on soda. No one really knows what causes Alzheimer's. Theres always some ""study"" that is coming out that says some item causes or reduces risk of it.

Alzheimers,Difficulty Completing Tasks,"Partner (senior) having difficulty completing tasks. They tried to explain it to me and they said, they will be doing a task but the other part of their brain tells them to go on to a different task. So they don’t finish the current task and move on to the next. Sometimes it feels like they’re going in a circle. Does this sound like Alzheimer’s? His family doctor prescribed donzepil but his heart doctor told him to not take this medication unless it’s absolutely necessary. I haven’t noticed anything strange yet but it’s worrisome. And he won’t go to an actual specialist. :(","It very well could be. I swear the Alzheimer's just exacerbated my grandma's ADHD.... She's constantly bouncing from one thing to another, and it's like she no longer possesses any ability to ""wait"". As in, will stop herself mid bite, to get up, and turn on an unnecessary light across the room.  Another example, is her taking her meds this morning:
Took meds out of the Despenser.
Walked around the corner to the kitchen
Put meds in a little bowl
Took out a wash cloth and laid it on the opposite counter.
Walked into the livingroom, opened her jewelry drawer, stared at it for about 2 minutes
Got a phone call .... 
She walked back over to her meds.
Got herself a glass of water.
Hung up the phone.
She walks away from meds, again, to put the phone on the receiver. 
Went into her bedroom.
Comes back out 2 mins later with a Kleenex (there is a whole box by her chair in the living room)
Lays the tissue out on top of the wash cloth.
Then pours pulls out of the bowl, divides them into piles before 
FINALLY taking her meds one little pile at a time.
It is very similar to what my husband does, a million half-finished tasks.  Also tasks finished but done wrong.  He has put gallons of milk, cans of soda, and now eggs in a freezer instead of the fridge.

However, you can't make any conclusions based on one symptom.  If you point out the unfinished tasks and suggest a neurologist could figure out what's going on, would he go for that?

If the anti-dementia drug is actually bad for your partner's heart, you sure wouldn't give it unless you actually know what the illness is, right?
Donepezil is largely ineffective and comes with a number of side effects. YMMV, but I don't recommend it. 

Best bet is getting to a neurologist. There are a number of conditions that cause cognitive symptoms associated with dementia that are potentially reversible (normal pressure hydrocephalus, extreme vitamin deficiency, etc). If the cause is reversible, the earlier you can get to the neurologist the better. 

Outside of that, external memory aides (reminders, checklists, labels, etc) can be very effective at helping persons with dementia stay independent and on-task.",2021-11-12 12:19:14,Hambrgr_Eyes,qsg0wp

Alzheimers,My father had a stroke. He's now in hospice care.,"I haven't really talked about this with anyone outside of my circle or with clients who needed to know why I wasn't available. A month ago, my dad had a stroke. He had a stroke last year, too, but it was a small one and we thought he was just declining in his alzheimers. He bounced back relatively well from that one. This time, he didn't.

He's been spending a lot of his days just laying in bed, eyes closed. We celebrate any times he opens his eyes or speaks clear words. He is getting in-home hospice care, which is exactly what we all wanted for him when his time would come - to pass away peacefully at home.

Today he had a really good day, and that kind of scares me. I know that terminal patients can rally when they are close to death. They can act almost like normal, even, which seemed to be what my dad did today. I couldn't get to the house soon enough to witness it myself - I only saw the after math once he had tuckered himself out, and he did seem more energetic.

Here's the crazy thing - and I say this as a person who no longer entertains the super natural... Our dad's caretaker who has been with him for almost 9 years now, told us a few months ago that dad grabbed her hand, and said very clearly (despite his tendency to mumble after the first stroke) that he would die on November 18. Again, I try and take these things with a grain of salt but with his burst of energy today and knowing that patients can rally before death, I'm kind of freaking out a little. It doesn't help that two days ago, the only clear thing he said to me all day was, ""Don't be afraid"". Again, kind of had the opposite effect.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Thers been so much on my mind and I can barely keep up with my own life because of what's happening. Every day just kind of looms over my head, and I never know what the last day will be. We're all just kind of taking it a day at a time and looking towards Nov 18 with a skeptical eye. I want to tell myself he's doing well and who knows what will happen, because he's always been strong. But he's 91 and an alzheimers patient... The ironic thing is that he didn't believe in spiritual or supernatural things, either. The irony.

Anyways... I just kind of wanted to write something out. I know most of my siblings understand what it is to ""rally"" but my half sister takes a good day and seems to think he'll be fine, and I hate having to listen to false hope. When my mom died, so many people had false hope, but I was the one who spoke to the doctors and knew what was going on, but I was dismissed when I tried to exppain that to people because, ""you never know what will happen!!!"" And right, you don't know, but we have a pretty good idea of where this is heading.

Like I said, I have no idea why I'm posting this. Just trying to work out my jumbled thoughts with other people who know what alzheimers does to someone. For ten years, I kept thinking I can't mourn my dad anymore, and then he gets worse and there I am, again. I didn't expect to feel this way when he was closer to passing away. I thought I would feel relief that he wasn't suffering anymore, but he had his small forms of happiness that he enjoyed. I was still happy when I could buy him something he'd like to eat, even when he couldn't swallow solid foods anymore. Sure, he could no longer appreciate the birds outside, but I can't count how often I'd catch him petting the cat or dog. He seemed to be at peace for those moments.

Now I'm just happy if he opens his eyes slightly if I speak to him.

It just sucks I can't appreciate that he had a good day today without worrying it may be his last 'good' day. I hate thinking like that. Anyways, thank you for letting get that off my chest.","I am so sorry you’re going through this. I have often felt like the Cassandra of my family, speaking truths no one wanted to hear. Partly, it’s because I spent the most time with my dad and now my mom, so I know much better than my brothers how it’s really going. Partly, it’s because I hit a point in my life where I just want to understand what’s really going on so I can deal with it. 

It’s hard. It’s hard watching them fade. It’s hard knowing it’s only going to get worse. It’s hard being gentle with people who don’t know or can’t do better. It’s hard coping with all the weird shit our brains try to turn into patterns or meaning when it’s really just noise, not signal.

If I could, I’d hug you and sit with you and let you talk or be silent as you needed. You’re not alone. You’re doing a good job. This, too, shall pass.
Thank you for sharing this. It means a lot. You’re not alone. I heard it all. And yes, you are right, it just sucks. So much. But you are an incredible child & human, no matter how the end of the day feels. Your dad knows all this too. Wishing you all ease and peace

My mother had Alzheimer’s and Vascular Dementia. She was doing great and getting her nails done (at home) on a Wednesday morning -her rally after a bout of UTI and pneumonia. She lost the ability to walk that evening, could no longer swallow by Thursday morning, and was unresponsive with no measurable blood pressure by Friday morning. Hospice declared her Actively Dying. I was an only child taking care of her by myself 95% of the time. Over night she was very close to death- all the eminent signs. I had a panic attack, broke out in hives…. Mom’s breathing returned to normal. She lived another 21 days, mostly in a coma. It allowed me the time I needed to really let go. Doctors said they could not explain. She passed peacefully on August 4th. I remember every detail and I am certain she was taking care of me one last time. I’m religious, and believe God allowed her to wait. 

It is very hard. The pain of watching a LO suffer is equal to the pain of letting go. I hope you are surrounded by peace.",2021-11-11 22:07:40,EloquentGrl,qs1xqi

Alzheimers,"Sudden, sharp decline in MIL who is in late middle stage","TL;DR: the title. Dramatic, sudden decline - anyone else have experience with delirium in a loved one with ALZ?

My MIL, who I love dearly, has early-onset (diagnosed at age 60).  She's 30+ years divorced and has lived alone since my husband, her only child, moved out. No other family close or close by. She knew something wasn't right but hid it for a long time, and unfortunately jumpstarted her noticeable progression by abruptly stopping taking antidepressants, which she had been on for over fifteen years. Her symptoms began progressing with a vengeance. We knew something was up, but this was right as covid got serious early last year, and it was incredibly difficult to visit her (she lived 7 hours away) and pursue a diagnosis, as most medical facilities in the area were closed except for emergencies. So it was some time before we received a diagnosis. 

We dropped everything when we finally knew for sure what was happening, sorted and took over her financial situation, sold her house, sold her car (both after *numerous* discussions with her and after assuring her full consent, meanwhile keeping her friends apprised of each decision and why), moved her to be near us, into a very nice apartment building. My husband sees her every day before and after work. We have respite car visits all but one day a week, twice a day for some days. I visit her often, make her a lunch every single day. We do things with her on the weekends - drives, walks, rock-hunting. We've done, in short, absolutely everything we can to make sure she's safe, healthy, and as happy as you can be when you know you have Alzheimer's.

She's been here since last August, and for the *most* part had seemed to have plateau'd. I mean, there's always good days and bad days, and the slow but noticeable decline, but overall things seemed somewhat sustainable. Last month we began to get serious about arranging assisted living - MIL was still okay, but we could tell things were beginning to approach that eventuality.  And then, a week and a half ago, she just.. fucking tanked. Waaay more confused, losing words at a MUCH greater frequency, making things up, getting lost in her apartment, crying a LOT. She stayed up all night a few days ago and 'packed' about three-quarters of the stuff in her apt because she was 'moving back home.' My husband has had to leave work twice today - once because she had hidden her phone in the dryer and wasn't answering, once because she managed to call him, crying, because she didn't know where she was. I'm probably going to have to go and stay with her after I write this, in all likelihood.

This is *drastic*. We're trying to get hold of her neurologist, but this looks, feels, and sounds a lot like an episode of delirium to me. Around the time this started, she started a new med - the antidepressant that she had been taking before this all started. She also is very stubborn about eating and drinking sometimes.

Has anyone else experienced delirium with someone who has Alz? Are there other telltales? Have you also experienced a much more rapid decline in the person even after it was addressed?

We moved like lightning (thank god we'd already started planning) and are moving her in to a facility next week, but I'm trying to get a better picture of what the future looks like after this - I'm afraid it's gonna be different than what we had anticipated before.

Thanks in advance. Love to all you guys - I hope your strength does not fail you and you remember to love yourselves too.","Get her a urine test.  Sudden declines often reflect a UTI, which after treatment, the patient returns to normal.  Of course I'd also consider  the coinciding with a return to her antidepressant.
UTIs cause this in my Mom. So does dehydration. If she was ok previously you may want to get her checked out before taking the step to move her to a facility. When my Mom is dehydrated she is absolutely out of her head. She’s in early mid-stage and flips to late mid-stage with a UTI or dehydration. It’s really freaky to see and deal with but she gets worlds better once both are treated.
Agree with the others about checking for a UTI. 

Beyond that, it sounds like her changes in cognition could very well be due to fear, depression, and lack of sleep. If she is confused about where she is, perhaps there is a way to use external cues to remind her, and to make her apartment feel more like home? 

Does she do anything during the day? Socialization? Hobbies? If she's just going stir crazy inside an unfamiliar apartment all day, that's not ideal. Is there an adult day center nearby she could try?",2021-11-11 14:57:13,Pargsnip,qrtk5l
Alzheimers,My mom just tested positive with Covid in facility…,"Just putting this out there for any good karma, prayers, or wishes I can get!

Best wishes and all good returned to all of you going through this double nightmare.","I know this sounds terrible, but I wanted my mom to get COVID. Better to pass quickly than die the lingering death she endured from Alzheimer’s. There was very little quality of life.
I'm not sure ""Go Mom"" is the appropriate sentiment when she's throwing trays, this sub regularly has posts about people being kicked out of facilities and families scrambling to find a place that will take them. But I appreciate what I think your trying to convey.

In any case, best wishes, hope she gets better soon.
My mom tested positive in a facility two weeks ago and had basically no symptoms and now is negative. She is 78.  The confining to the room was awful for her, though. I hope your mom is fine.
My 96 year old aunt caught it in her facility. She felt bad for two days and ran a temp for one. Then she made a full recovery. You never know.
I’ve been through this.
Sending positive vibes and thoughts your way! My Nana, who's 81, has had Covid twice in her facility and had barely any symptoms. You are not alone in this, it is horrible but you'll make it through.

Alzheimers,First responders team up with Alzheimer’s patients and caregivers,,,2021-11-10 12:29:14,Indisia,qqzi3q
Alzheimers,"New here, story and would love some suggestions...","I'm a 36 year old who's mother is beginning to progress down the path.  Her mother had Alzheimer's, her sister has Alzheimer's, and although she has seen several doctors, including some specialists, she is yet to be diagnosed.  However, she forgets things minutes after having lengthy conversations about them.  This finally came to a head this past weekend when I made the two hour trip to see her for her retirement party.  She's in her mid 60s and I think she would have worked until she dropped dead, but I'm suspecting her work is ""*suggesting*"" she retire now.  Anyways, we were at dinner and as she was looking at the menu she kept asking if she liked a particular item. Over....and over....and over....   

While we were there, she mentioned that her neurologist wants to get her to use this newer drug Aduhelm.  I've read quite a bit of controversy about this.  Including someone who died here very recently, potentially from brain swelling (a known side effect.

I told her I feel like we should get her a referral to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MINN.  Anyone have any experience with this?

Sorry this was a little scattered and rambling.","I am an Alzheimer patient myself 

I have participated in Aduhelm drug program for five years. 

Long story short.  

I was “stable” during the phase 3 study with no side effect whatsoever.   Biogen resolved the ARIA problem via 6 steps ramping of the drug. 

It turned out I was in “placebo”

I continued with phase 4 study which is “open label”.  It means I actually have real drug. 

It has been a year.  I still have no side effect. 

Better yet.  I have very positive cognitive improvement.  

With that being said, I have also decided to “apply training” to my brain. 

My hypothesis is that “drug” alone might not be good enough.  Therapy has to accompany. This is similar to stroke therapy recovery. 

I will be glad to answer all questions.
Cassava Science is starting a Phase 3 trial for their AZ drug and are currently enrolling patients.  May be worth looking into on company website.  So far drug is showing promise with no side effects.  Website also has a link to doctors associated with the trial.  Wishing your mother the best.  🙏🙏. Here is the link www.cassavascience.com
I find it odd she hasn't been diagnosed but her neurologist wants to prescribe her a drug for it. I think you'd be hard pressed to get her insurance to cover it without an official diagnosis, especially when several insurance companies are unwilling to cover Aduhelm currently amid the split its created in the neurology community. 

Does she have someone going to her appointments with her? I agree with the other person that suggested you go with her to an appointment to discuss her next steps, especially if she's having trouble with short term memory. 

When my dad was first being tested (he's in his 60's like your mom) they didn't find anything on the initial CT scan and needed a MRI and EEG to find it. I was shocked when they didn't find anything immediately because he had been having severe aphasia. 

Good luck and your mom is lucky to have you looking out for her!
You could ask your Mom if you could come with her to the neurologist's, where you could discuss all of this openly. I've no experience with the drug - my parents completely avoid doctors it seems. The symptoms you are describing match my Dad's exactly. I'd pursue treatment locally unless you feel they are inexperienced/incompetent/inadequate. Alzheimer's is common enough that not everyone will benefit from visiting Mayo - I'd consider that a last resort unless I had money to burn.
These are the same symptoms my mother showed.   If possible, can you call your neurologist?  They aren't allowed to give you patient information, but you can explain that you need to have your mother's cognition tested, and you'd like to come to the appointment.

e:  I don't know how long it takes to get an appointment at the Mayo Clinic, but any neurologist can diagnose dementia; it doesn't take a specialist to diagnose, only (perhaps) to treat.
Where are you located? There are top tier Alzheimer’s research centers in many states, you may not have to go to Mayo if it isn’t local to you. Sorry to hear about your mom.",2021-11-10 09:35:40,PartialNecessity,qqvsld

Alzheimers,Atypical progression (garbled words & global memory). Can’t figure out what stage mom is at or what the timeline might look like from here. Any thoughts?,"In 2017, shortly after our 23&Me test came back showing that my mom (now 72) and I (now 38) had one copy of the APOe4 Alzheimer’s risk gene, I began to notice odd blips in her communication, namely, constantly reversing pronouns (always “he” for females and “she” for males) and becoming more easily tongue-tied. In addition, she became confused in the airport when traveling to visit me in NYC and was increasingly paranoid that her debit card had been hacked, thus carrying massive sums of cash to avoid using it.

However, she still scored 28/30 on her MOCA in 2018 (not great given that she was once a brilliant engineer), and there was no noticeable further decline until the pandemic and with it extreme stress, isolation, sudden weight loss/frailty, and a catastrophic series of spinal fractures from rapidly progressing osteoporosis. In just 8 months, mom looked and sounded like she’d aged 10 years. A trip to the gerontologist in fall 2020 revealed her MOCA score had plummeted to 21. The doctor suggested early-stage Alzheimer’s. Mom went into furious denial and refused follow-up appointments. We did, however, manage to stop her osteoporosis progression with Reclast and hormone therapy.

Fast forward to now: Mom struggles terribly with communication, garbling or  substituting “it” for a given noun every few words. 

For instance, when trying to explain the switch between standard time and daylight savings, she said to me: “it’s up and it comes through now in the bedroom and then after it’s the same time but less of it.” When what she means is: “The sun comes up earlier now, but in the evening, it’s dark earlier, too.” 

Additionally, she’s forgotten my (her only child) middle name, my birthday, that I was married for 14 years, and massive amounts from her own past (like that her lifelong best friend died of cancer 21 years ago. Mom was at her bedside). She’s also unable to recall her medications for a doctor, use a computer (insisting it’s broken), or set up her own appointments. 

But at the same time, her house is immaculately clean as is her hygiene. She scoops her cat’s litterboxes and feeds them like clockwork. She drives to the post office and grocery store nearby with relative ease and still manages to pay her bills on time (I carefully monitor her finances). She also keeps track of both my partners, their jobs, and my own job search — enough to hold a conversation with me despite her many missing words.

I’ve done several assessments online to figure out her stage, and I’m completely stumped. They all say she’s MCI or very, very early stage Alzheimer’s. But doctors, when they speak to her, indicate to me that she’s much further along given her tangential speech, missing words, and memory gaps.

Indeed, I can’t find any description of Alzheimer’s in which language and long-term memory are the first to go. Has anyone else experienced anything like this with their loved one? I’m so afraid that her early loss of basic words will render her unintelligible to me or her caregivers years before her body gives out.","I think dementia progresses differently in different people. My mom is entering the advanced stage and scored abominably the last time she did the MOCA (less than 5 I believe. She kept the house clean for awhile and only recently started having trouble with her hygiene. And no signs of incontinence yet.
This does sound difficult and frustrating for you and your mother!

The language issue your mother is experiencing is called aphasia.  The degree that you describe is typically a later stage sign of dementia but is not necessarily the case.  There is a rarer dementia known as Primary Progressive Aphasia(PPA) which starts out as only speech/language troubles but eventually begins to involve short-term memory, executive function, and so on.  People with aphasia tend to have hard to finding the right words to use and will ""talk around"" things instead.  For example, instead of ""I put it in the refrigerator"" they may say"" I put it in the uh, that cold box in the, uh, kitchen that food goes in"".  THis is called circumlocution and is common in PPA as well.

Aphasia can also make a person seem further along than they are because they are unable to answer questions and this would certainly impact the MoCA. Almost every section of the MoCA requires speech except the first one.

Given that your mom is still maintaining more advanced activities of daily living (paying bills, driving, etc), exploring Primary Progressive Aphasia would be a good idea.  Most physicians are unaware of it including general neurologists; however, so it is important to find the right doctor.

There are 3 types of PPA:  

- Semantic variant which typically impairs understanding of language spoken to the patient or the meaning of words. They may not remember what the word television means or what a toothbrush is used for, for example.  This type is usually not caused by Alzheimer's but by tau protein build-up similar to Frontotemporal dementia.  This is probably the most common type.  


- Logopenic variant which is impaired ability to speak phrases well. They may say words wrong like ""girt"" instead of ""dirt"" or ""daper"" instead of ""paper"" or just use wrong words.  But they can understand what you ask of them even if they cannot respond well verbally years into disease.  This variant is usually a type of Alzheimer's disease.


- And agrammatic variant which presents with omitting words from sentences like ""I took dog walk"" instead of ""I took the dog for a walk"". This is also usually an FTD related variant.

All variants will have some amount of word-finding difficulties and circumlocution as well.

If you happen to live near Chicago, IL, Dr. Mesulam is the best expert on PPA in North America.  Neuropsychological testing would also be able to identify her aphasia and may help with the diagnosis.  I hope the best for you and your mother and that you can find the help you guys need!
Alzheimers is just one form of dementia. Other forms (like vascular dementia) can attack the ability to speak first.  Try researching the other types and see if any of them fit your mom's situation.",2021-11-09 14:43:52,NotedHeathen,qqbkh8
Alzheimers,My sister wants to help my mom by taking her to music therapy but she refuses. How do you deal with this?,"How do you deal with patients when they don't want to do something that could be good for them? 

My mom has always liked singing and belonging to a choir. Since she has Alzheimer she's no longer able to do this, so my sister had the idea of calling a music therapist to improve her life. She offered it and my mom refused. There was no way of convincing her. She even randomly called my sister (sometimes she remembers stuff) to tell her not to force her to go to ""music lessons"". 

Is there a way to do this anyway? We can't force her, right? This is not like medication where she also refuses but after some arguments she takes them anyway.

Anyway, how's everyone else's experience? thanks in advance.","Your sister probably thinks a switch in her brain will turn on and a miracle will happen and your mom will sing beautifully.  Happens in the movies all the time, quite rare in real life. What is most likely to happen is your mother will get a constant reminder of her disease and a great deal of frustration and sadness. Do what’s best for your mother, not your sister. 

My mother has a good friend that visits often, she insists on watching a new movie with my mom (this is something they used to do all the time). My mother kept saying no because she couldn’t follow along with the new movie and it was extremely frustrating. I told her friend to pick a movie my mom was familiar with and watch that.  The friend didn’t want to watch the same movie over and over even though that gave my mom the most enjoyment.  The problem wasn’t with my mom, it was the friend.  Now they just talk, no more movies
My advise is to take her to some live music instead. Find a café or park that has live music. It sounds like your mom is still with it enough to feel like she's being tricked - so don't trick her and just offer to take her out to eat where there is music! <3 Hope that helps.
This is more general, but anything I wanted Mom to do I would try and see if she could help me do…. I have two tix to this, will you please go with me. A friend is coming to visit; I need to run out.  Can you and — chat for a while until I return. I also gave choices. Do you want to take a shower or bath; shower or just wash off. You get the idea. Try and keep her feeling safe and let her feel like she has some control. It’s got to be hard being an adult with everyone telling you what to do.
Bring music therapy to her! Just play her favorite music.
My dad refuses to do everything. Sometimes I try asking 3 or 4 more times, at diff times of the day, on diff days. Sometimes he’s with it enough to know I’m tricking him, other days he doesn’t. A lot of it is me practicing to let go of getting him to do things. It’s exhausting to keep trying but sometimes it pays off and he says yes! I’m just getting better at accepting his no’s
Unfortunately, at some point, it seems that you have to take control of the decisions, and stop asking and just do. It is so,so terrible. My Mom hasn't known who I am for years now and it never gets easier. Get the help you and they need. Not everyone is cut out to be a caregiver and that's why you need help. Peace.
Look into adult day care centers in your area.  Even one day a week, or anything more, can be quite socially refreshing for seniors.  They have varying activities, simple games, movement therapy, music, art, and nutritious meals.  You should go just for a ""tour"" to see if it's something she might enjoy.

Alzheimers,Feel like I made a deal with the devil moving mom in.,"TL;DR Moved mom in with me and the family to take care of her and protect her assets. Starting to feel like a bad move. 

My mom was a single mom starting when I was three years old. She had a high school diploma and an hourly job. We lived in someone's basement for a couple years after the divorce, then to the second story of a crumbling two flat. Mom was frugal, used old bed sheets for curtains, shopped the generic aisle almost exclusively (the old school black and white generics), dressed me entirely in hand-me-downs from cousins and neighbors. She still managed to provide an amazing time growing up for me. A week long vacation every year, a ticket to Great America once a summer, even found an NES under the Christmas tree in 1985.    
Mom worked for the same company for 42 years before retiring. She managed to own a small condo outright, owned her modest car and had a decent retirement account.    
After a personal tragedy to her 20+ year boyfriend, I started noticing the little things that indicate a problem. Forgetting days, dates, the time; an occasional shirt on backwards or inside out; some crazy stories that in hindsight I believe were hallucinations. I didn't think there was a problem at this point but wanted her closer to me (she lived an hour away) so she had daily interaction with my family. We sold her condo, she bought a townhome and things were supposed to be good.   
Having her closer and interacting with her more, I realized there might be more to what I thought were just quirks. After a couple years I realized she was forgetting to make meals, had expired food in the fridge, was getting lost in her car, was having difficulty getting dressed and had a small issue with incontinence.    
After considering the options (in home care, assisted living or moving her in) and consulting with an estate planning attorney, I decided we'd sell her place AND my place to move us all into a house that would give her space and allow us (my wife, three older kids and myself) to help her.    
A small aside here. As I began raising my own family I realized the struggle it must have been for my mom to raise me alone. I also found out my grandmother (her mom) criticized my mom for dating when I was young, telling her I was her main responsibility and dating would compromise that. I felt terrible for my mom and promised myself I would find a way to pay her back. I saw moving her in and caring for her as my opportunity. 
Additionally and the be honest, I was also selfish about securing what mom had worked her whole life for. *stopped typing here to help her with going to the bathroom, she had a bm in her Depends*. My mom had a small retirement account and owned her townhome. Liquidating that for private care in a memory facility would maybe cover four years. I thought it would be better to save that money and buy a joint property with some of our combined assets.     
Here we are now about six months later. Mom has declined quickly. She has both urinary and bowel incontinence, can't dress herself, can't bathe herself and can't follow very simple instructions. Caring for her has become a strain for my family. We were ready to interview an in home care service tomorrow but now my son and my mom have tested positive for Covid making a difficult situation worse.   
I love my mom beyond description but this is terrible. I created this am full of regret. We can't just move her into a care facility now without covering her portion of the property and don't have the assets to do it without selling the house we just moved into. I made a deal with the devil.","You made a deal with your mom, and more importantly yourself, whether she knows it or not. 

I’m in the same boat, can’t afford to pay for moving her into memory care, moved her in with me and my gf- it is WAY more than I bargained for. I have one brother and a sister who help out, and one brother who hasn’t lifted a finger or offered a single penny. 

All the stress, headaches and changes to my life aside, my deadbeat brother is the one who made a deal with the devil. It doesn’t make things much easier day to day, but at least I can tell myself that when times got hard, I did what I could- and I did the right thing. 

So did you. Give yourself a ton of credit, I imagine it seems like not many other people will. It’s a ton of weight to carry around, but you didn’t run away from it. It’s a small consolation, but years from now maybe we’ll both be able to at least be proud of actually knowing what kind of people we really are when our family needs us.
You should not be down on yourself for any of your actions. You're trying your best with what you know and Alzheimer's disease is just being a greedy bastard to you all. 

Assuming you live in the US, have you tried to find out about:

1. Your local Alzheimer's Association or AARP? They have free classes and support groups. Classes for stuff like elder law or financial management for elderly to help you out. Granted they are kind of like advertisements for the firms for teach them, but they do teach a bit and take questions at the end. You should at least consider if these options are right for you. They might help you navigate medicare and medicaid to get more help. You may want to consider moving all her assets, accounts, and poa to you, to protect her but also bc of some years of look back before you qualify for some kinds of aid. 

Local support groups are good because if theres ppl in your area who have gone thru the same they may have some opinions or inside info to share about people or orgs you might work with locally. 

2. Your state and county eldercare or elderly services offices? Services can vary greatly even by county. In a densely populated area they may offer more variety, but there could be longer waitlists. Less dense areas can have different services and shorter wait times. Some states or counties might have depts for dementia care too. I was able to get a few days of day care and in home care each week for my relative. I think california has a system where you get paid for being your own families caregiver. 

All offices may have a handbook or pamphlet of resources or guides and sometimes have these online. Stuff like that can be handy for having all the volunteer orgs around you listed. Free help probably can't give medicine or restrain them, but they can often sit with alz ppl and keep them out of your hair while you do other stuff. Or some can help with things like cleaning or laundry while you help alz person. 

3. Since you have your own home you can do modifications like adding a perimeter fence maybe, or putting things in to stop or discourage wandering. 

4. Since your mom has covid and maybe after covid.. Depending how bad it gets, you could also consider in-home hospice care. It doesn't have to mean its giving up on her, but if times get hard bc of physical health you could try, and if she gets better (they do treat acute illnesses even in hospice), she can be taken off hospice. 

Anyway sorry you are going through this, good luck.
I'm so sad to read about your situation and I totally understand you because we experienced a similar situation with my mother in law. Thu little things you noticed we lived through them.


 Definitely you need outside help, your family is and will suffer as time goes by if you don't get help.

You have done your best to help her,  at this time the best you can do is keep her happy and confortable for the time she has.

The sickness is the devil and there is no way around it. One day you will be able to say proudly you did your best for your mom as she did for you.

Stay strong.
I hate to say it, but I used to hope that Covid would take my mother who had late stage Alzheimer’s. She wasn’t enjoying any quality of life. In the end, it was just dementia that got her.
First thing is to get her checked for UTI. UTI can make things much worse. 

I have the money but refuse to put my wife in a home so I am determined to give her the best care I can. She will have an accident every now and then but many times during the day I take her to the bathroom and ask her to sit on the toilet and go. Works most of the time.
You did what was right at the time. Alzheimer’s is unpredictable. You couldn’t have seen this rapid decline in her condition and increase in needs.

Call Medicare and your state’s aging and disability services. My mom lived with us for a year before opting for assisted living. Medicare covered tons of preventative services to help keep her in the home and prevent accidents that can lead to more medical care. I don’t know if Medicare covers home health aides, but it might. Your state agency might provide home health aides. They’ll do the toileting and bathing and feeding and keep your mom company. Then you could at least get some help and a much needed break. There are also private agencies. (My mom, after a career as a teacher, got her CNA and worked in private homes with people with dementia. Some needed full time care and she worked shifts. Others had a spouse at home who just needed help.) There are tons of people in your situation and tons of resources. All of this should cost less than Memory Care.

Good luck!

Edit: I missed the part where you were interviewing home care, but got waylaid by COVID diagnoses. No facility will take her if she’s COVID positive, but if she gets bad symptoms, a hospital certainly will. You’ll have to ride out the COVID (bummer), then get back on track. I hope she just gets minor symptoms!
Alz can last for years. We are on year 11. Almost 5 in a home. 2 unleavable at home . 
Get a lawyer who deals in elder care. It can destroy the rest of your family and their quality of life. Financially and mentally. Your mom would not want that for you. It's very very hard and it will get worse. You don't want to start to hate her or resent her. It happens. Finding a way to get her into a home where there are caring staff and she is well taken care of is the best decision for your family.
You did what was best at the time, so please don’t beat yourself up over that. If you think that it would be better for your family if she was placed in a facility, contact an elder lawyer. They can advise you how to protect everything she worked so hard for and help you figure out how to pay for facility care. Any good lawyer will offer you a free consultation.",2021-11-09 09:44:31,imnotmarvin,qq5659
Alzheimers,hospice update on my late-stage dad,"Hi friends, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qlvg3k/nearing_the_end/) a week ago about getting my dad on hospice. It's been a whirlwind. His facility at the time had been oscillating between asking us to find my dad a new facility and then saying for over a month he could stay. My dad had started having issues with aggression and hurting staff and residents. Hospice got him on dilaudid 3 times a day and my dad is barely affected by it. His facility said he could stay ""for the rest of his life"" and then the next day flipped again and said he needed to go. We have REALLY struggled with finding another facility willing to take on a man with ""behaviors"". Well, we found one and pulled the trigger despite knowing a move would be pretty catastrophic for my dad's behaviors.

Well, we moved him today to the new facility. He hadn't even been there a few hours before we got a call from the hospice nurse that he's punching people and throwing things. Sigh. I just am hoping he doesn't have to suffer long like this but I just am so worried he's going to go on like this for years. He is completely unable to give direction to, he can't focus on you, you can't get his attention, he is forgetting who my mom and I are, he speaks almost entirely jibberish now, he's completely incontinent and falls a lot. He needs assistance with all but feeding and that's becoming a challenge. He can pretty much only eat with his hands. I just don't know how much longer we can bear this and if his new facility will work with us and keep him. I'm just amazed the dilaudid isn't really doing what hospice expected. He has zero quality of life. It's so depressing. I just hope he can stop suffering soon.","Aw, man, I haven’t even the slightest idea of what’s supposed to be done. When my dad got violent towards me, my mom shipped me off. When he got violent towards her, she called the cops, and he was commuted on a 5150. Once the local psych ward confirmed that he had dementia and was violent, they shipped him off to a locked memory care facility. While I wasn’t kept updated, they did manage his behavior well enough that I didn’t hear anything else about violence. I think in his case, the fact that he had been alone all the time and then was in a facility with regimented activities and constant socializing helped. Of course, he was constantly trying to escape, so there was that.

I hope it gets figured out for your dad sooner rather than later. Take care of yourself.

Alzheimers,"Dealing with Alzheimer’s escape artists – trackers, etc.","Our mother is in a memory care unit for Alzheimer’s and has escaped from two different facilities. Her current unit is very responsive to breaches, but they have to maintain fire egresses and she’s still able to read exit instructions and get out onto the street.

We’re considering getting an Apple AirTag or some kind of tracking device we can tie onto her shoelaces. Has anyone used tracking devices to keep track of their loved ones in this way? Any suggestions on how to minimize these safety risks?","We got a Jiobit and ziptied it to his shoe. He was very adamant about wearing his shoes and we only left one single pair of shoes out so it was his only option. He didn't have access to sharp objects/scissors at that point so he wasn't able to remove it.  We'd have to replace it every few days depending on how often he was out of the house (it uses less battery when you're at home, not out and about).  We ultimately got 2 and would just swap out periodically. When he stopped being so adamant about shoes we ziptied it to the back belt loop of his shorts. That worked until he started getting naked all the time, at which point wandering was no longer our biggest problem (helloooo incontinence!). It worked well for our situation for awhile - but everyone is different. The app was good, setup was easy, and it was reliable enough to give us some peace of mind.
Mom combined an apple air-tag along-side a Ring security system that alerted her phone to doors opening. That last part's been most effective, but I suspect that won't work in your case.
We had a medic alert bracelet with GPS tracking and even paid extra to get a band that made it look like a watch, but she kept throwing it out and the cost of her throwing it out was excessive. If it wasn't familiar to her, she would throw it out. New clothes, jewelry, etc. would always end up in the trash. We looked at these thinking we could slip them into her favorite shoes, but they're always sold out. [https://gpssmartsole.com/gpssmartsole/](https://gpssmartsole.com/gpssmartsole/)

Now she's confined to a bed or her wheelchair, so the flight risk has passed, but it was maddening learning that she'd escaped again.
Apple airtags are great, but they do sometimes make a ringing sound for no reason. They're still probably the most affordable option worth trying.
We have the Apple AirTag buried in Mom’s purse. She doesn’t like walking, so at this point there’s only a very mild concern that she might drive somewhere and forget how to get home. This is only precautionary; she’s still a good driver and only drives around our small town. I just like to be prepared. She does sometimes go through her purse and pull it out and ask what it is.
Might be easiest just to take all her shoes <grin>
Some facilities have a wander guard system that even if they get off the units they were a device that locks the doors if they get near them. I run a memory car facility and I have 36 residents that wear this device.
Thanks all. Will look into these options. The facility found out about the breach almost immediately and found her quickly. A big problem is that she’s bored — she’s at slightly higher cognition level than most residents. Somewhat sadly, this won’t be as much of an issue the quicker she deteriorates. Anyone else encountered this difficulty?
we got a door knob child lock off Amazon and it has been the greatest peace of mind. not sure if it'll help in your situation but all the best to you!

Alzheimers,Grandma often returns to a child like state like cuddling soft toys or asking to be cuddled and getting upset when people leave like a young child. Have people had experience in this!? New to Alzheimer’s research so TIA,,"Yes, this is absolutely a normal progression.  That is why so many caregivers get their loved ones doll babies (realistic looking ones) or even realistic looking puppies or kittens.  As their brain degenerates, they lose the higher functioning they once had.  Including the ability to dress, feed themselves, brush their teeth, regular activities of daily living, etc.  They become more child-like and then, if they live long enough, proceed to an infant stage where all they do is sleep and require total care.  Please understand that this is very real to them.
Yes very common with Alzheimer’s
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoezelen

Most Senior care facilities that specialise in dementia have a designated room for snoezelen, with a waterbed, or a massage chair, small lights, soft light, sweet decorations, soft blankets and stuffed animals/dolls. Not every patient needs it, but for some it's absolutely everything they long for. Resources for tools/toys often overlap with those for handicapped kids. Sturdy and can be cleaned well, accessible with a lift assist. And expensive. 

You can tinker around with light and sounds in her room to make her feel less alone, place her chair so she can easily see you, turn on the TV in the background (mindful of the program, the news can be scary!) And try a weighted 'snake' to put in her lap, or over her shoulders.

Alzheimers,Advise on supporting my girlfriend who’s mom has Alzheimer’s.,My girlfriends mom has Alzheimer’s. On Halloween she took a bad fall. I’m worried that it will take a huge emotional toll on her if/when she gets worse. I watched my mom take care of her own mother as she went through a similar situation. It was incredibly hard on her and I fear the same for my girlfriend. Any advise on how best to support her would be greatly appreciated.,"Let her cry to you. Visit her mom with her. Pamper her sometimes. It will be hard for both of you. ❤️
My wife has been a caretaker for her mom with alzheimers/dementia for years now, it's brutal. 

Please take time to make sure your GF has supportive people around her. Family, friends, anyone who will be a positive influence are worth their weight in gold!
With Alzheimer’s is not a question of if it'll get worse, it's when. If you see something that needs to be done and you can do it, offer to do it, and then if she's OK with it, do it. If you're not sure, ask her what you can do, and then do it. Or tell her you can't if you can't. If you tell her you'll take care of things and then they don't get done, even if you have reasons she'll learn not to ask anyone for help when she really needs it.

There's not a lot my SO can do to help right now, but he's exceptional at following through on the things he says he'll take care of and I can't tell you how much it means to me to know that.
It will definitely  be hard on both if you, be prepared for that. Be her venting board. Don't offer solutions, at first, just listen. Maybe you two could go to an Alzheimers support group?
My husbands mom was diagnosed while we were dating and it was hard to know how to support him, but it really came down to just letting him know I’m there for both him and mom. Do your research so you will be best prepared for how to help and stay positive for the three of you",2021-11-04 20:59:28,advantagegrant,qmzixx
Alzheimers,Mom has Alz / Dad is avoiding his job as caretaker,"I am dealing with something perhaps someone out there has advice on.

My mom has Alzheimer's; it was hidden from us for years, and has now become unavoidable.  They're on the young side, she's 67 and he's 70.  She has hallucinations most days.  Short term memory loss.   
 She's starting to forget who we are at times.  And cannot get dressed herself.  Her hygeine is questionable.  We do not know what stage she is at because she forced my Dad to drive to her neurologist and cancel every upcoming appointment.  He obliged.

Their house is in absolute shambles; the grief has caused my father to start projects around the house that he does not finish.  There are piles of tools and screws and saws and dust on literally on every single surface.  My mother doesn't have anywhere to go and will sit on the couch playing with a ball of yarn that she untangles and re-tangles.  It's so crazy to type something this disturbing, as our upbringing was generally pretty happy.

We do not know if she is taking her medicine, but I doubt she's taking it properly. My father is not administering it.  She took her wedding ring off on Halloween out of fear it would fall off when handing out candy, and it seems to now be lost.  

My sister and I are trying to pick up the slack by finding an elder care lawyer, locating a new neurologist, scheduling the appointments, and even arranging to have my aunt take my mom for a walk when we need my dad to be available.  We've also talked to the elder care resources in their county for a home visit and to possibly set them up on wheels on meals.  (They lived a very blue collar life.)  But every once in a while, I need a piece of information from him, and he can't make himself available.  He texted me today saying that I can no longer call him on the phone for these matters, because it makes my mother upset when he steps away for a period of time.

I think his grief is profound, and his house feels like quicksand.  This week for the first time he broke down crying on the phone and hung up on me when I brought up trying to get them Meals on Wheels.  There is a lot that I still need to do, but he does not return texts, does not return emails, forgets to bring his cell phone with him, but does not answer it.  It's like trying to help a brick wall.

However, he will reach out when my mom has a catastrophic episode in the hopes that we can help get her mind off the task at hand.  This happens every three days or so where we'll get an urgent text telling us he needs one of us to call immediately.  He can't get his mind around telling therapeutic fibs, and is constantly getting into arguments about how there are ""no other people living in the basement.""  Last week I was so worried about my father I gave him the number for the Suicide Prevention Hotline.

I am doing all that I can, and taking a pretty huge amount of my week trying to help (I live on the west coast with two kids and an unstable career, they're in New England).  But the guy needs medicine, therapy, and group counseling.  And my mom needs even basic care.  I have a feeling my situation isn't atypical, and curious how anyone else has helped ""lead a horse to water"" as I'm trying to do in such desperate situations.  Or whether or not this is severe enough for me to fly home for a few months, and take legal guardianship over my own mother from my dad.  (Though I have no idea how I would swing that financially.)

Thanks in advance for any perspective!","Dad needs a break.  You talk about flying home for a few months, do that.  Give dad a break and see what's really going on.  Send dad to the sisters or somewhere for a week off.  

At the end of your week you might find why her hygiene is off.  You'll have fallen to your knees and begged her to shower without success.  Your hygiene will be off as well.  Hard to shower if you're worried about her wandering off, turning on the stove, etc orrrr you're answering constant questions while showering.  (No, I don't want a cookie right now, thank you.  Please turn the light back on.)

Want to get something done?  Have fun with that.  Walk out of the room and she'll either call out or come looking for you because she hasn't seen you all day.  That's why there's sawdust everywhere.

Yes, he cancelled the appointments.  Because it's easier.  Because Mom is saying she's just fine.  It's a fight to get her to the shower before the appointment.  It's a fight to get her to the appointment.  She denies anything is wrong in the appointment.  She's scared and worried before, during, and after the appointment.  The night after the appointment is hell. It's not the right thing to do, but it damn sure is easier.

Look.  You're doing all the right things, and trying to help.  I understand that.  But your dad doesn't have time for himself.  He's overwhelmed emotionally, physically, and any other \_\_\_ally you can think of.  He's thinking and doing for 2 people.  And one is fighting him every step of the way.  (Not really, it's the disease, but it still feels that way.)  And you're calling and demanding answers and decisions.  

Dad's not avoiding his job as a caretaker.  Dad's overwhelmed.  Dad's doing all he can, and it's not good enough, and never will be because this is a horrible disease.  What worked 3 minutes ago doesn't work now, and that woman that was happy content 1 whole minute ago is now crying or screaming or worse.  And now the phone is ringing and it's my wonderful child calling to tell me I'm not doing enough and need to do this, this, and this.
Same boat here with my dad and mom. Hang in there :(
In our case, it's dad with dementia and mom in denial. For years he was angry and hateful and she bore the brunt of it. We tried many, many times to help her understand it was the disease, not just him  yelling at her, but she could not seem to accept that. She wouldn't call anyone if he was suffering from new symptoms that could indicate a health problem (weakness, incontinence, confusion). We would only find out when she called to tell us about an instance when he was mean to her. He has type 2 diabetes and she wouldn't make any effort to learn how to cook for him. 

I found a private social worker who specializes in seniors and arranged weekly meetings with my mom. It gives her someone to talk to and, as the social worker isn't family, my mom listens to her. Things aren't perfect. Mom is still very stubborn and resents having to care for him, but they are much better.
You are definitely not alone. This was my parents as well, father with alz and mom as the caregiver. Dad did all the cooking and cleaning so things started to go south as the disease progressed. Mom was in total denial and kept insisting that his memory was fine because “he talks about our family history in such fine detail!” He started leaving the house “for walks” and I warned my mom that one of these days he was not going to remember how to come back. She brushed me off.

Then it happened - he left the house one afternoon and he was nowhere to be found. My mom called my sibling in a panic who told me. I live halfway across the country. We spent the next twelve hours frantic with worry. Luckily he was safely picked up by the police and then dropped off at a local hospital.

But that was the beginning of the end for my mom’s mental health. She had always been an optimist with a “we’ll find a way” attitude, but this really broke her. It was clear we could no longer leave my dad alone, so I flew home, visited multiple adult day care centers, memory facilities with her while trying to figure out how to pay for it all. My sibling was still in denial, even after the wandering episode, and refused to commit to anything, which made every decision a stupidly ridiculous and complicated uphill battle. 

I wanted my mom to keep working, not for the money but for the social interaction but in the end she decided to quit to care for my dad full time and my sibling supported this choice. But she did not care for him at all, instead she fell into a deep depression. The house fell into shambles and I was utterly shocked at the condition of the home the next time I visited. My mom barely spoke with me and barely made eye contact and spent the entire time of my visit sleeping or staying in bed.

It’s been about three years since then. My sibling had moved the both of them from the house to live with him, insisting that he could take care of them better than a facility would but I honestly did not think so. He has a short temper, no patience and would constantly scream at my father when he did something wrong. Then he would scream at my mom for “being lazy” and not helping or making a mess in the kitchen. When my dad finally passed earlier this year, he was in shock and told me “I always thought he would get better” and I could only stare at him in disbelief, because despite how much I tried to educate him on Alzheimer’s it was clear that every I, and every doctor, said just went in one ear and out the other.

My mom has been doing a little better since my father has passed, but she’s not the same person as before and I fear that she never will be. I’m moving her in with me today and I hope that I can help her come out of her shell again with more regular social interactions that don’t involve screaming tantrums and political rants.

All this is to say that some folks can take on the burden of a caregiver mantle, but others not so much. I know caring for your mom is the higher priority, but please don’t forget to help your dad too. He is going through a lot - if I could go back in time I would have moved them both closer to me so that I could have cared for both of them more thoroughly early on…but it is a scary step to take in the moment and I didn’t have the confidence to stand up to my sibling like I do now.
This sounds so much like my parents' situation, but my mother is now further along. After two years of trying to convince my dad to move her to memory care, he finally agreed to it. Putting my dad in touch with a social worker who specializes in Alzheimer's was a big help. Are they in RI by any chance?

EDIT: Ok, now that I'm no longer drifting off to sleep, I have more advice:

I can completely relate to what you've written. The published advice for dealing with a loved one with Alzheimer's generally assumes you're the spouse or a child whose parent lives alone. Dealing with two parents, where one has dementia and the other is of sound mind but is just in deep denial/has mental health issues is a particularly frustrating situation that isn't addressed very often. 

My sister and I have been dealing with my mom's Alzheimer's (and my dad's denial) for 5 to 7 years at this point, so it's hard to even know where to start with advice. I just have way too many crazy stories to share. The stories are so out there that people regularly ask, ""are you sure your dad doesn't have Alzheimer's too?"" NO! he's been screened a million times and always passes with flying colors. He is just in denial and depressed and his actions don't make sense.

With that in mind, here is the most straightforward advice I could come up with.
1. First, remember your parents are not children! We've all read that caretaker roles reverse as your parents age and the child becomes the parent, blah blah. This is simply NOT true. Your parents are both adults, especially in the eyes of the law. Sometimes your dad wants your help, but also sometimes he doesn't want his child telling him what to do. It's a really irritating paradox. And although it's normal to feel guilty that they have a bad living situation, etc. there's truly not much you can do if they refuse help or sabotage the help you arrange for them like my dad often did. Plus, society really doesn't offer any useful resources for dealing with this problem. There's only so much you can do, especially when you have your own life, children, etc. (and please don't feel guilty for having these things!) 
2. Bring it out into the open. For years my sister and I tiptoed around their feelings while openly discussing my mom's declining mental state with each other. My dad thought he was hiding her condition from friends and extended family, but it turns out that everyone knew the whole time (don't even get me started on the stupid stigma surrounding this horrible disease). It was obvious. Keeping up the charade of denial doesn't help anyone or anything.

3.Next time you're in town, take dad to a lawyer. We checked in with an estate planning lawyer, but I think most people consult an elder care lawyer. You need to explain your family situation to this person and make sure everything is in order in terms of power of attorney for both parents, how to get control of their assets to care for mom if something happens to dad, and how your family plans to pay for your mom's long-term care. It sounds like eventually your dad will need to either accept help or place her in a facility, but Medicare doesn't pay for any of this. It is typically private pay or a lawyer could possibly arrange for her to qualify for Medicaid at some point. Hopefully getting these questions sorted out will give dad some relief and also force him to face reality a bit. 
4. Maybe on this same trip home, you and your dad could meet with a social worker, therapist, or geriatric care manager to assess your family's unique situation and get some advice on next steps. Alzheimer's support groups are probably good too, but we've had a hard time finding any in-person meetings due to covid. And my dad is not really interested in Zoom meetings. Be sure to discuss with them what should happen if your dad has a health problem and ends up in the hospital for any amount of time, which is a distinct possibility since he is under so much stress. My sister and I did not plan for this, and I had drop everything and drive 4 hours away when my dad ended up in the hospital with an emergency. He then had to go to rehab for months. Mom couldn't be alone of course, so I had to stay in their house that whole time. It sucked! a lot. 
5. Don't worry too much about the neurologist or Alzheimer's medication if it's a point of stress. Honestly, there's no point wasting your limited energy on these points, IMO (although others might disagree). They are not really going to improve your mom's situation all that much for the amount of stress it's causing. But it is important that she see a primary care physician at some point to address any other health problems. I believe they can also adjust her meds, if necessary, although meds don't really do all that much either. 
6. remember: You can't fix this! You can't make your mom's disease go away, and you can't fix your dad's problems. If your dad is anything like mine, he just wants the Alzheimer's to go away. But it won't.  I think getting guardianship of your mom is probably not a great idea, but maybe look into it if that's something that interests you. Be aware that society offers very little help when it comes to the massive problem of dealing with a loved one with Alzheimer's. Many times it will feel like there are obstacles at every turn. So just do the best you can with the resources that you have. And NEVER feel guilty if you need to put your own kids and partner first!!!
We went through something very similar with my in laws - they were in the UK, we'd be flying back from the Middle East every few weeks to give FIL some respite, batch cook meals for the freezer, trick MIL into attending medical reviews, etc. It was unsustainable, but somehow we struggled along for a couple of years. FIL remained in denial about her condition the whole time, refused outside help because of pride/cost/fear of MIL's reaction (she still thought she did all the cooking and cleaning, when in truth I was doing it every time I went back).


I can't even remember the straw that broke the camel's back, it may have been another UTI that caused massive deterioration, but we finally managed to hire a weekly cleaner, and later a daily carer who would cook. A year later, we hired a second carer to help with bathing & dressing in the morning after we discovered MIL had stopped showered because she didn't know what to do. 


Earlier this year she started suffering double incontinence and forgot how to walk. She was a risk of falls because she'd try to get up, not realising she'd ""forgotten"" how to walk. Husband and I moved back for 6 months. At FIL's insistence we kept her at home for as long as possible but it got to the point where I was carrying/lifting her to bathe & use the toilet. It caused me a lot of back pain, and on top of that we had to go back home. FIL eventually relented and we put MIL into a specialist care home, where she is thriving. 


At some point, you have to take the decisions out of your father's hands. He is suffering from denial, decision paralysis and guilt. 

I don't know how it works in the US, but we got medical & financial power of attorneys for MIL which helped immensely when dealing with all the admin related to her treatment and subsequent move to the care home. 

It helps to be on the ground when dealing with all this, and it'll be easier to speak with your father face to face. But it may take more than one trip to prepare him for the inevitable. 


I wish you all the best.
Sorry you are going through this, it is really tough. My father had a period of denial when we found out my mothers diagnosis, he refused to believe it and went into a deep depression for a couple of years. Thankfully he was able to come out the other side and understand the situation better. It sounds like your parents really need close support 24/7. I can only wish you the best and hope you can resolve the problems they are having. Take care of yourself.
Some intermediate steps - short of placing her involuntarily in memory care, etc - are to send her to an adult day center a day or two a week.  My husband really enjoys his, and other LO's I hear about also enjoy it.  Dad has to get into a caregiver support group.  Offer to pay for a housekeeper to come clean house regularly.  Enlist visiting nurse services to help mom with hygiene, medication management, vitals checks.  

It's still going to be hard, but these things can make a substantial difference.
Ohhh, so very sorry, IntrepidLobster, very sad, traumatic & disturbing for you all, I feel for you!   This getting older thing can really suck.  

Sometimes, you just have to start stepping on those toes!  For sure, it sounds like, if you can at all swing it, you or yr sister need to go there in person.  It's crisis point.  I'm Down Under, so I have zero knowledge re : legalities of guardianship, capacity assessments, respite / residential care / home-care services, etc.   It sounds like, yr mom, for herself and for yr dad, needs to go into permanent residential care, but idk how it works there if you can get someone into state-funded care so quickly....

 Can you get your mom into temporary respite for a week or 2, or even just a few days, send yr dad to visit a relative maybe for a few days?   Or even just get them out of the house for the day.   Sure, yr dad has depression-type issues going on, stuck further & further into the rut.  Sometimes when the first steps get taken, it shifts a few cogs, and things can start to change.   Can be massive upheaval, but yeh.... For a start all these unfinished projects, house in disarray, needs to be cleared up so your dad isn't daily 24/7 facing this very obvious visual mountain of desperation and failure. 

 Get them out of the house, have a few cleaners standing by ready to move in & whirlwind  sort it out asap you get yr folks out of the house.  Have a stack of large clear plastic containers ready to put all yr dads stuff in, (others for mums stuff) so he can 'sort through it' later if he really wants to.  Obvious everyday items left out of the boxes of course - just the stuff that doesn't need to be all over the place.   De-clutter some while your'e at it.  

Elder care resources for their area it's great you're already speaking with them, get all info re : yr moms respite, potential medical intervention idk if a doctors appointment can assess/validate her eligibility for respite, & potential local facilities?  

Alzheimers Australia (now Dementia Australia)  were a wealth of knowlege & resources & assistance for our mess that happened.  (I was living overseas, didn't realise it was that bad, sister with significant mental health issues was living with mum (well, scamming off her, more accurately), creating massive disaster & neglecting our mum.)  Dementia / alzheimers orgs generally have telephone help-lines, in-house appointments / consultations for advice on all aspects, tons of resources / tips / etc, for the memory-lossed & their family & carers.  How to kick-start desperately needed help for the uncooperative &/ those in denial, everything.  I think you ought to have some pow-wows with them, see what you come up with, whats possible to manage to get done or at least start rolling.  

So sorry, I feel for y'all!   Best of luck with everything!
I am so sorry. imho this is urgent.  Maybe both could go to some respite care? Unfortunately at least your mum sounds like she needs full time care and your dad needs at least attention and professional grief councelling.
Your father was/is my father. My mother suffered emotional abuse and he neglected her. He told her that her sister and mother died every night. He locked himself in a separate bedroom. We called a county senior services agency to investigate. They surprised him one day, looked around. They gave him 30 days to place her in care facility. Twenty days later she ended up in the emergency room with pneumonia and a severe leg infection. She recovered and went to rehab. Four weeks later my father placed her in assisted living instead of a nursing home (because it was cheaper). She fell trying to walk. She broke her femur, went to hospice/ palative care, died four weeks later.
He is depressed... you need an intervention
My mom passed away suddenly this year and she was my dads caretaker. She was also in denial for years. When this happened, my wife and I had to move to where my dad is and we now live with him. But his shock + dementia confusion + grief made him suicidal in the beginning. 

Well after my moms passing, I was terrified to leave him  alone at all. Until I was able to be there full time, I got his primary to write referrals for PT, OT, speech etc in the home. I knew it would be impossible to convince him to go see providers, let alone be able to drive there independently or not get lost. Basically, I called in reinforcements from every pocket I could think of so he was beginning to get some support and wasn’t alone. I told him it was mandatory he allow these providers in the home in order to keep getting his pain meds and in order to stay on Medicare. (Practically free healthcare majorly helped motivate this agreement) This worked. I also made sure to tell him this is what his doctor ordered. He likes his GP so he’s more willing to listen to him than me.  I’m getting VERY good at the therapeutic fibs! 

You might even be able to get therapists and a social worker to do home visits. This could help both your mom and dad! Tell Dad that the therapist there for mom but in reality they’ll work with him too. And tell mom the therapist is there for dad! Both might be willing to take the support if they think it’s for the other person. 

The service providers well knew that the support was more for a crisis matter and they could only stay as long as he was willing but they did find things to work on with him. They eventually discharged my dad but it bought me a few months so I was able to move. Hope this helps and feel free to DM me if you want!
The burden of being a caregiver to a loved one is absolutely crushing. My step dad had a time when he called me to come look after my Mom, and jumped on a plane and left town for a couple of weeks. I was pissed, but he was at his wits end. If possible a hired caregiver that can take care of personal hygiene needs and a break for dad. Cleaning service to do regular cleaning and laundry. Very difficult for independent folks to accept or acknowledge they need help. Good luck and God bless.",2021-11-04 22:02:40,Intrepid-Lobster-159,qn0pha
Alzheimers,TV remote is too much to master for Dad,"My Dad has dementia (neurologist believes it's Alzheimer's but no solid diagnosis yet) & using remote for his tv has become impossible. I show him which buttons turn power on, change channels, turn volume up at least 50 times a day & 30 seconds after telling him he can't do it anymore. I can't sit on the couch next to him 24/7 to change channels etc. 

Does anyone know of a SUPER simple remote that will work in a situation like this?","I've seen where people tape up and hide the unnecessary buttons and label the On/Off, etc clearly.
Here's a [remote](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Flipper-Large-Button-Universal-Remote-Control/210250293?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=101001350&adid=22222222222317161613&wmlspartner=wmtlabs&wl0=e&wl1=s&wl2=c&wl3=74423306522533&wl4=pla-4578022850900495&wl5=&wl6=&wl7=&wl10=Walmart&wl11=Online&wl12=210250293_10001020720&wl14=remote%20control%20for%20disabled&veh=sem&msclkid=1310ee04004d109b85058f8085f48de3&gclid=1310ee04004d109b85058f8085f48de3&gclsrc=3p.ds) sold at WalMart. I'm sure there are many models similar to this.
Yes, the Alzheimer’s store has a simple remote. You can pull it apart to reveal more buttons, and you use those buttons to program it. Just google Alzheimer’s remote and I’m sure it will come up.
I bought special remotes and even used a razor blade to cut off the buttons that weren’t needed form remotes.  In the end remotes were beyond my husband.  I was able to get an iPad locked into Netflix (guided access feature) and he could just touch what he wanted to watch.  It was not perfect but it gave him some feeling of autonomy and gave me a break.
quick google shows:

My dad can still use the remote but he doesn't seem to be able to follow any shows and usually just takes a nap instead of watching anything.
Get extras for back up.
My mum found my dad trying to use the TV remote as a mobile phone the other day. 😭😅
My spouse has the same issues.  It's annoying for me because he often hits buttons by accident and messes up a show we were watching or changes the default settings.  I don't know of a remote that is simple enough that people with Alzheimer's can use it.  And even if they can today, in six months that will be gone.
My Mom has no clue how to use the remote. The only technology she can manage is the land line telephone.",2021-11-04 20:47:34,Augustus_Chiggins,qmzajv
Alzheimers,Any advice for dealing with behavior/personality changes? It’s just getting worse and I feel so helpless.,"7/8 years ago my dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. 

He was a VP at a company and dealing with a very stressful time in his career, working impossible hours abroad. My mother was aboard with him and couldn’t work so made friends and created a support system for herself. My dad felt like she wasn’t supporting him properly emotionally and that she was just out having fun while he was working non stop. Im not here to judge that situation as I wasn’t there and I can see how it would have been hard on both of them in their own ways.

My dad was diagnosed when they returned to the US. He is now retired & on disability. He often connects his diagnosis with the fact he felt she didn’t support him and that’s why he had this mental break. Since returning home, for the past 7/8 years, he has been depressed and irritated and while sometimes this is directed at the diagnosis and his declining short term memory and focus, a lot of it and majority of anger is directed at my mother for their time abroad while he was working.

He cannot or will not let go of the issue while they were abroad and has emotionally been quite abusive to my mom for the past 7/8 years. He won’t or can’t move on, says it’s just constantly in his head and that his heart and trust is broken for the emotional abandonment. He’s made her apologize multiple times and has only just “accepted” it recently when he made her write it out - but he still can’t move on. They have had (and are still having) therapy and counseling, he has a hypno therapist and he is on medication - none of this seems to help. He wants to switch therapists whenever they want to keep talking about what happened or when they mentioned that he shouldn’t keep trying to claim to spot of victim. 

He’ll go from wanting a separation and being depressed/angry for a few days to telling my he can’t live without her and she’s the best. If my mom suggests separation he says she’s selfish and that’s the easy way out for her because he’s sick. She doesn’t want to leave because he is Ill and will soon need someone to care for him but this has taken its toll on her. He’s like Jekyll and Hyde. 

I try to be there to help and emotionally support but there is only so much I can do. I feel so bad and don’t know how to help the situation. I know Alzheimer’s affects emotional and behavior stuff as well as mental faculties but is this it for the next 5/10 years?","Because of the toll on your mother, a relatively earlier move to assisted living might be a good idea.  He'll be convinced he is being dumped, which will be true, but he brought it on himself.

I would suggest therapy but they're already doing that.  Because of his mental status, any talk therapy should take a supportive, rather than insight, goal.  His ability to learn new concepts is diminished.
I don't really have advice, but I feel you. My MIL (alzheimer's) has an almost identical problem with accusing her husband of emotionally abandoning her. Sure, it had been a factor in their marriage for decades, but a minor one. Now it's constant and obsessive. He truly loves her and does his best to care for her and not take it personally but I know it hurts. 

We've found it's basically impossible to convince her otherwise. Even if she agrees that he loves her, 10 minutes later shes forgotten and she's bashing him again. It's the alzheimer's and you can't un-alzheimers them. It's a terrible disease.

Our go-to is distraction. My husband and I have a mental list of memories or events or things with her husband we just don't bring up because we know it will trigger her. If she does get in that rut, we literally say ""hmm yes I understand, I'm sorry, say how about we play some cards"" etc. Best wishes and I'm sorry.
Have you explored medications to control behaviors, primarily Seroquel?  This is commonly used in dementia patients with behavioral changes or hallucinations and is pretty effective.  Other antipsychotics are riskier as they can cause parkinsonism which can lead to falls. 

Outside of these behavioral and personality changes, have you noticed a severe decline in other cognitive abilities over time?

From your description, it sounds like he is at least somewhat cognizant and able to process things and make decisions.  Not to say that they are correct or rational decisions, of course. 

An early onset AD patient 7/8 years into the disease would typically have diffuse impairments.  This is approaching the end-stages typically as early onset AD progresses faster than the more typical late-onset.  

Patients this many years into an early AD diagnosis would typically not be aware of their deficits at all, may not recognize their wife/children, be unable to make a sandwich, require assistance bathing and dressing themselves, may not recognize their own home or remember how to find the restroom, and overall require 24-hour care.


I certainly cannot know all that is going on with your father but I did want to point out a possibility just in case. The reason I bring this up is that cognitive deficits safter a mental break with severe stress is sometimes misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease. Depression-related cognitive impairment can mimic Alzheimer's and cause major memory troubles but will not progress in the same fashion but can last many years if not successfully treated.  It also is associated with major stress events in life and significant uncontrolled depression like you described.
 

If you haven't seen these major cognitive changes that I described, it may be a good idea to get a second opinion with a memory specialist or re-evaluate with neuropsychological testing.  Genetic testing is also typically beneficial in early-onset AD as there are 3 primary genes that are usually the culprit.  Presenilin 1, Presenilin 2, and mutated amyloid precursor protein.  A lumbar puncture evaluating AD markers would also be very diagnostic 7/8 years in.  

Again, I am not in any way trying to armchair diagnose but I wanted to point this out for you just in case!
My father was also a rather successful businessman and with his early onset he lashed out against my mother and all those close to him (I was not allowed in their home for a year)  


What did help him was a doctors prescription for  [Olanzapine (5mg/day) to help treat some of the thoughts and behaviors caused by his dementia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181134/) this treatment greatly improved his symptoms that included aggression, paranoia and such.   


I encourage you to speak to his physician and to make sure that his affairs are in order after finding effective treatment.  This includes getting power of attorney if it's not already done.  


Just remember, there are others that have been through this and done a lot of the hard work so there's paths forward for you to follow.
This is so difficult, I am so sorry. I'm an art therapist who works with this population and my guess is he does not know how to cope with the loss and changes that are happening and so your mother is an easy, safe target. This being said, your mother does not deserve to be treated like this, of course. Do either of them attend local support groups with other caregivers and folks with the diagnosis? That might be especially helpful for your mother. It is not uncommon for folks with Alzheimer's or another type of dementia to pick one thing (this happens with terminal illness as well) to be blame and be fixated on. My guess would be that in reality, he does not want a separation from your mother, it is an easy way to lash out and hurt her.   
If the therapist is not working out and he is open to switching, I might look for one who specifically works with the population and can meet him where he is, and perhaps take a fresh look at his medications. Especially if it seems his symptoms aren't being managed.    
How are you taking care of yourself? You also need support through this. This should not continue for the next 5-10 years, it will pass as the disease takes its course, even if it does not feel like it right now.",2021-11-04 06:56:34,SimplyPeachy92,qmi16p

Alzheimers,"How do you deal with somebody who's always been abusive, but it's only gotten worse since the illness started?","My dad has always had a temper. He's always been angry. He's always been an emotionally and verbally abusive to my mom.

Edit: I realize now that I'm ranting and venting more than I might actually asking a question. I'm sorry. Not a lot of people you can talk to about this sort of thing


But it didn't used to be that bad. He kept himself in check. Throughout most of my life I didn't even realize how much of an asshole he was until I was in my mid 20s

But now that he has early onset Alzheimer's, it's amplified all of his worst qualities. Angry all of the time about things that don't matter. And then once he starts on a tangent, he starts talking in circles, and he's yelling about things that don't make sense, and he usually forgets what he was angry about in the first place but he still continues to be angry.

He's not far enough along for us to put him into some kind of care home. And even if he was, they probably kick him out for being abusive to the staff.

My mom should have divorced him and left him decades ago. But now it feels too late. Part of it's the guilt. She doesn't want to leave somebody who's dealing with something he can't help. She'd feel like a terrible person for abandoning someone in need. And he has no friends. And his family doesn't like him, none of  his sister would take him in.

And because he doesn't have any other support, anywhere else to go, I'm convinced that a restraining order won't be enough. He'll forget and keep showing up at the house anyway.

She can't afford to just pack up and leave him. Even though that's probably the best and only option. And hell, part of the reason why we don't have anything saved is because of how you're responsible he is with money. He's not far enough along for us to get power of attorney. We can't stop him from accessing his own bank account. So every time is disability check comes in, he immediately takes cash out and buys pot. And now he's at a point where he'll smoke everything he buys almost immediately, forget that he bought it, and then try to buy more. He's taking from money that should go to the car insurance or the mortgage

I've seen so many stories of people losing a family member to Alzheimer's. Somebody tragic stories of people talking about how they're watching their loved ones slip away. And it's heartbreaking. But that is not been my experience at all. This asshole has become an incredible burden.

I mean, I'm damn near 40 and I'm still living with my parents. I moved back in after his first heart attack to help him out. But before things got stable enough for me to move out again, that's when his Alzheimer's started showing signs. And now I just don't feel safe leaving her alone with him.

TL;DR, how do you deal with someone with Alzheimer's when they're Alzheimer's amplifies all of their worst qualities to the point where you wish they would just fucking go away?","I would talk to his doctor (without your father there) about slipping some mood-altering drugs into his meds.  I assume he's on some meds?  Typically Alzheimer's patients take Aricept or Namenda or both (or some newer ones?).  And he might be on something for his heart?  You have to let the doctor know just how impossible his behavior is.

Are you in a cannabis legal state?  If you are not, you could call the cops and ask them to arrest him on a pot possession charge.  

Even if she can't get power of attorney, possiby your mother can make a case to Soc. Sec. or wherever his disability check comes from, to get a ""protective payee"" that only gives him a small cash allowance, due to excessive spending on marijuana leaving too little for necessary living expenses.  Ideally this would NOT be your mother who is taking enough abuse already.

Your family has my sympathies.
Holy cow.  You could be talking about my dad.  Ugh.  Clearly I have no answers because I am living this myself, but my heart goes out to you.
Def talk to his doc about upping his mood stabilizers.  He needs to chill out.  Do your best to change the subject when he starts ranting.  Are you hungry, hot, cold, did you see that bird, squirrel, what’s that on the ceiling, oh wait, it’s fine.  When I used to take my mom to the doc I always waited in the hall to talk to him before he went in to see her.  Just say I’m going to the bathroom.  Start looking for day care.  It’s possible that would give everyone a break.  It’s not cheap, but way less than full time care.  Good luck.
I somehow relate to your post, my grandma (who always had a bad temper to begin with) has alzheimer and she is a living nightmare for my grandpa (to the point she bites, scratches and throws objects at him when she is angry...one day she threw a knife at him. I also almost had a fight with her). And same, she gets angry for nothing in particular...

I don't live with my grandparents anymore but I know my grandma keeps hurting my grandpa. He already met a doctor to get some medication and tranquilizers/sedatives (?) for my grandma but it doesn't seem to work effectively...

I don't think I have any advice to give you, that's a really difficult situation to deal with. My grandpa and myself, we're still trying to figure out what are the best things to do. Maybe the only thing I can say is to stay calm in all situations, especially when your father is angry.

Good luck to you and your family.

I've got no clue but I want to help. Hopefully someone can point you in the right direction.
1. POA is not something you obtain only when the person is aways down the road of dementia. The person must be “of sound mind” at that time they sign a POA. If they already are no longer mentally astute, you’d need to go to the courts for guardianship to override his unwell decisions. You have collections notices for his bills? 

2. Your mom deserves a life. Some days ago it was posted here with 40% of family caregivers to people with Alzheimer’s die before the patient does.  There is a nonzero chance she could go her entire adult life burdened by this man who doesn’t provide for her financially or emotionally. Sounds like he burned all his own friendships and relationships on his own.

3. How broke are they? If they have assets, your mom may need a an elder law attorney to make sure he can qualify for Medicaid without dragging your mom down with him and losing the house after he dies.
Living with a wife like that now.  She has a history of verbal abuse and a hot temper, along with depression and anxiety.   Her mother was diagnosed with dementia in her early seventies. My wife is in her mid seventies and is exhibiting all the signs on the dementia checklist.  She denies she has a problem, and I am not about to send her into a rage by telling her.   I decided (with advice from the local helpline) to inform her doctor, who has now requested a phone visit with her later this month.  I hope she is able to give a cognitive test of some kind on the phone and work towards a diagnosis.  I am going to need some respite soon.   She has become very demanding and needy and her mood swings are baffling - and stressful for us both I am sure.   The folks on the helpline echo many of the comments here about bad behavior/qualities getting worse as the disease progresses.    Thanks for sharing.  Good luck.",2021-11-03 14:25:33,kappakingtut2,qm0s3a
Alzheimers,Nearing the end,"Hello all, thanks for all your advice and comfort during this shitty journey. I feel we are nearing the end. My dad began getting aggressive and agitated a few weeks ago. Last week hospice was called and we began hospice. The hospice nurse has been talking to me about terminal agitation and that she thinks that's what he's experiencing. They still oscillate between dementia ""types"" but my dad had been in a rapid decline the past several months. I hadn't noticed it as much but my husband had. My dad became completely incontinent, complete lack of facial expressions (just a slack face), I can't get or hold his attention anymore (even with tapping his hand, giving him a hug, etc), he didn't recognize my mom for the first time last week, he seems to be eating less. 

I know everyone's final stages are different. It feels like it's been rapid but I don't think that's too uncommon. Hospice has begun dilaudid to keep my dad comfortable. They do not suspect he has much time left. Any thoughts/experiences you all can share when your loved one got to this stage? My dad has not had any quality of life for some time now so I am mostly at peace with this. I know he would be so mad we even ""let"" him get to the stage where we had to move him in to memory care. At this point, I know he's just suffering. It's still a very painful decision. Thanks, friends.","My heart goes out to you. I lost my Mom Oct 13th.
On mobile, sorry for the format in advance.
Here is what we did when we called Hospice in (Mom was in a memory care facility).
They allowed us (Dad and I)  to come and go freely despite Covid when she was ""imminent"". They even let one of us spend the night. They made up a bed for me although I did not sleep.
They placed her in a private room. We played her favorite music for her from our phones in between just sitting with her and holding her hand. We made sure she had a quilt from home to keep her warm. She refused food and liquids for several days so we made sure to moisturize her lips with the sponge swab. Hospice nurse gave her a bed bath with scented body wash/scented lotion to make her as comfortable as possible.
The nurses were phenomenal with turning her every hour and giving her morphine and atropine (for secretions) anytime she needed it.
We spoke to her about all things, from the trees beginning to turn fall colors to the sunshine (she absolutely loved sunny days). We talked about past vacations and memories that meant a lot to us.
Hearing is the last thing to go so we also decided to tell her we would all be okay, that we would take good care of each other and that it is okay to let go. We would be with her until the end, she would not be alone. 
That was something we made sure of, if we had to leave to go home to sleep for a bit the Hospice Chaplain was with her or the Hospice nurse. Several minutes before the very end we noticed a change in her breathing. I pushed the call light and the nurse came right in. 
My Dad and I were with her when she left us. It was peaceful . 
Afterwards, the Hospice nurse and facility nurses asked us what we needed. Dad and I just needed a minute to cry and let go. When I called the nurses back into the room they were incredibly supportive. We sat with Mom until the funeral home came to pick her up.
This is our experience, everyone is different. I am profoundly sorry you are going through this. I send you thoughts of comfort during this time and may you find peace.
Ugh, the phrase ""terminal agitation""... haven't heard that one yet. My MIL was pretty agitated when we visited last. She kept being mad the ""little girl"" was making noise, (her formally BELOVED granddaughter), mad when her son was flipping a water bottle, mad at everything. She is down to 89 lb and im just not sure whats in store for us.

Reminds me of my grandfather, who when he was dying was super mean. He loved whataburger but when my mom offered he yelled ""I don't want no god damn Whataburger!"" I found some humor in that, ha. But now I think of our last visit with MIL and she went ""BIG WHOOP"" when we offered her a PJ and J (her favorite there) 

Sorry you're going through this... I wonder if I am and don't even realize it yet.
Cannot give you any advice as I haven’t gone through this yet - but I am sending lots of love and hugs to you
>Any thoughts/experiences you all can share when your loved one got to this stage?

LO went on hospice two years ago. Had the bed set up, catheter, oxygen and everything. Today, she takes daily walks, uses the toilet, and feeds herself. We all have theories as to what happened - mainly related to medications. But it was extremely difficult during hospice and after. Like mentally and emotionally difficult. On top of the usual Alz difficulties. 

I imagine reading this causes lots of angst. I'm sorry. Maybe I shouldn't say anything. But, I am a better caregiver than I was before that event. It is still a shitty journey. It just helped me reframe the whole situation. How do you be with them when you've been with them for so long? How do you be with them when it hasn't felt like they've been with you for so long? What is my grieving process? And, When? When? When? When? The answer really is we don't know. 

Wishing you, your family, and your dad peace in the coming days.
Haven’t crossed this bridge yet but hoping you find strength and peace in the days ahead. We’re all here for you.",2021-11-03 10:17:02,chirp16,qlvg3k
Alzheimers,Mail The time has come to move my Dad to a home. I’m in my 30s and this has all been new. I’ve been his full time caregiver the last two years and I’m wondering-do I forward his mail to me? Or to the nursing home? I’m assuming to me since it’s not like he understands what his mail is. Help!,,"My nonprofessional opinion, based on experience with caregivers, is have it forwarded to you.  I could hardly believe the things that were missed in my absence last year when I couldn't travel to be with my grandmother.  
When I got here to stay earlier this year there was a box full of mail just sitting there with property taxes (which I'd asked them to watch for), a letter with a signature required for continuing her pension (only reason she didn't lose it was they extended the deadline due to covid) and some other random bills that were terribly overdue (most things she'd previously set up to autopay with me able to view/pay as needed but some stuff was a surprise).
I have my moms mail sent to me. Any cards she gets from friends or family I will then bring to her to look at.  Hang in there.

Alzheimers,Dealing with family,"I'm 27 and I've been dealing with my Dad's early-onset Alzheimers in its late stages for the last couple of years now (incontinence, aggressive behaviour etc), he's suffered from Alzheimer's for the majority of my adult life. However, his living situation isn't usual. He has a live-in carer, in a house that's nearby to his sister & her husband. They cover the carer's breaks each day - something I find crazy considering how bad things are getting - there isn't a desire from them to remove Dad from his home and into a care facility (sister has power of attorney). Anyway, I cover a long break every other Sunday. This is becoming harder & harder for me. I feel like the anxiety I get is ruining my week before, I'm on edge the whole time I'm there & it's taking me 2-3 days to recover once I get home & back into my routine. I feel like this is down to the fact I have to change Dad when he soils himself, try to calm him down when he's very distressed, screaming, trying to hit me etc. My auntie & uncle are insistent that he's getting the best care, in the best situation, living by them, whereas I would much prefer to visit him maybe more frequently in a professional care environment & remove the anxiety of making sure I'm doing a good job keeping my Dad clean & safe. I don't feel Dad is under any threat or that he's in danger, but for me it's becoming too hard to enter that environment. I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar, how you've dealt with other family members, or can tell me I'm not an awful son for finding this situation extremely difficult to manage.","Tell your family you would be more comfortable to visit him while other caregivers are there. It doesn’t sound like there’s a money issue, so share with them that emotionally it’s too difficult for you to be there alone with him and change him when he soils himself. It’s okay to voice your needs when your loved one is sick.
Hi! I'm a similar age to you (28), and I've lived a majority of my adult life helping care for my mom who has early onset. About three years ago, I moved back home and worked part time while caring for her. After about a year I got my own place but was still helping care for her and then about a year and a half ago things really took a turn and I had to start setting personal boundaries. My dad still lived with her and was caring for her but he was working full time (and then part time for a bit). He has always been very resilient to the situation and I think it's hard for him to understand my point of view, but once she became consistently aggressive, I no longer felt comfortable being alone around her. Also, similar to what you mentioned, spending time around her would mess with my mental health for DAYS. Finally, this past summer my dad decided to move my mom in to a facility, but I basically had to stop helping care for her because it made me so uncomfortable between summer 2020 and summer 2021. It's important to create boundaries and take care of yourself, too. I tried to remind myself that my mom pre-alzheimer's would not have expected me to put myself in major mental distress to help care for her. She would have been understanding and still loved me. I know this isn't really any advice, but I hope it helps you feel less alone because your post helped me feel less alone, too.
I’m 25 & my dad is now in the late stages of the disease. Though it’s been about 7-8 years since he was diagnosed, I’m sometimes still in denial about it. My mom is his primary care taker but I often help out and man it is hard and exhausting... you’re a great son for doing all you do and have done so far. Most people bail, or do a half assed job of taking care of their loved one. 

But as a caretaker I’ve learned that the only way to give the best care is if you’re also taking care of yourself. It’s okay to need breaks, think about getting a hospice or home health aid that can come by a few hours everyday, or create a schedule that works best for you. You have to find a way to not get tired or too overwhelmed because it’s a long and hard journey. 

Like many things in life, There’s no manual to this disease and how to handle it. We learn as we go, and these support groups are helpful because you get to see how other people are dealing with it. 

Wish you the best! 💜
Your wanting him in a care home so you feel comfortable visiting is unreasonable. Instead, ask that the carer stays.",2021-11-02 13:51:14,RJLHUK,ql9wvy
Alzheimers,"Made decision to put mom in care in a coupe of weeks, but am now feeling really depressed about it. Anyone else go through this?","I'm questioning if she really needs to go into 24-care now, even though she's in late Stage 5 Alzheimer's, and I was really sure about it when I made the reservation for her. I'm scared about the process of tricking her to get there, because she won't agree to go, and having to lie to her. Has anyone else had this experience?","Oh yeah - it sucked I get you! 

We basically had to drop our mother off at the ER because nursing homes were not accepting new applicants during Covid. It was becoming dangerous for her and us so we felt like it was the only option. We ended up telling her that she had to go to the doctors for an overnight stay in order for them to do some tests. 

It really did suck to lie to her but we also knew it would make it much more smooth of a process than if we had told her the truth. 

I’m really sorry you’re going through this. I won’t lie and say it was an easy day - lots of sadness and tears. However it really was the best decision for her and for us. She gets way more socialization and much better care than we were able to give. We basically got our lives back. 

I am thinking of you and sending you hugs.
We are on year 4. Best decision for all involved. Safe.  Warm . and nobody is fighting in the family about who does what. You can just visit and love her. No drama. It's not lying. It's a comfort fib.
We told my dad we were really excited that we found him “an apartment with help.” In my dad’s situation, it’s the best place for him to be. Some days he loves it, other days he hates it, but he is safe, social and engaged there. It also takes the burden off us kids. It’s not easy, though.
This can be a really hard transition - \*big internet hug\* in your direction. With my mom, we told her a gentle, vague lie (""you're going to stay at a nice place, and there will be people to be with all day and lots of good food""). She was a little farther along in her illness (stage 6). Dropping her off was, I think, more painful for me, my dad, and my uncle than it was for her - she was surprisingly docile and didn't get upset leaving us the way we anticipated she would. 

A metaphor that helped us at the time was thinking about this decision like a river that we knew we would eventually need to cross, and that there would be multiple points along the way where we could make that decision. But there is no wrong decision, and there's a good case to be made that earlier is better both from a giving her more time to acclimate perspective and in terms of caregiver burnout. I'd encourage you to let yourself grieve this transition as much as you need, but also hold onto the fact that your grief doesn't mean you're making the wrong decision.
Yep. Had to do it with my 83 year old mom in May. I held off as long as I could, but two days before she was punching and kicking me hard enough to leave bruises, and then ran out to the sidewalk to flag down people to call the police since I was being “so mean to her.”

Two days later, we went to a physician’s appointment. She decided not to leave the office, since I was being so “mean to her.” The doc was aware about what was going on. An ambulance was summoned, and it was off to the ER. She was inpatient for a few days with an abscessed tooth I didn’t know about, and it was off to respite care while I made arrangements for a permanent placement.

This month will be the first thanksgiving she’ll be in-patient in memory care. I know it’s going to be tough for me, and I’m still not sure how I’m going to handle it. Christmas is going to be really rough.
I'm sorry you going through this, we had some of those guilty feelings ourselves.  You will deflect and have to hide the truth, but in the long term is better for her and for you. Sadly the person she was slips away every day and at the same time your life goes on hold or just plain gets break to pieces.

Today you feel depressed thinking you are a bad person, you did the best with what you had, but you been building a sand castle with the tide coming in.

This sounds horrible, but you need to regain control of your life, took my wife a few weeks to realize we just couldn't handle my mother in law, and expert care was our only option to move forward.
Yup it sucks also FYI you may want to sways go in every night and check on her / make sure she is cleaned feed and tucked in. Lots of nursing homes are short staffed and can’t take care of our parents like we would if they could be home with us.
Ugh going through this right now. Moving him in a few weeks. Have a small lie to tell him but I already feel guilty. I know it will be for the best but it’s a hard choice to make.",2021-11-02 15:11:04,NotGoing2EndWell,qlbpg1
Alzheimers,"Using Amazon ""echo show"" for communication with loved one in a care home?","Has anyone set up an Amazon ""echo show"" device to keep in better contact with a loved one in a care home who has dementia/alzheimers?

We are going to be moving my step-dad into a care home this month, and so we're trying to find a way for him to stay in contact with his kids and wife.

He is not able to use his mobile phone very well, because he has arthritis in his fingers and he forgets how to navigate into the phone screen, etc.   (Plus he often forgets to charge his phone.)

I thought perhaps it might be easier for him to just say ""Alexa, call \[person\]"". Then each of us can have our own echo show device in our homes.. and we can do video chat, etc.

What do you think? Is there an easier way to keep in contact with someone in a care home?  


Maybe something like Facebook portal?  [http://portal.facebook.com](http://portal.facebook.com)  (I just heard about this one, but I don't know anything about it, so I'm not sure it would be super easy to use like the echo show?)

Thanks!","It will largely depend on the facility. My dad's facility does not allow monitoring devices like that.
We tried the Google Home when we moved her, but my mom couldn't figure it out. She was around stage 4 at that point.  Even saying ""Call X"" or ""Call my daughter"" was too difficult for her. Technology of any kind became too much. She wouldn't even talk on a phone or through a window, which made COVID visits really challenging.
I love mine, for my mom who lives at home with me- I use the “drop in” feature all the time, it allows you to speak to her through the app, no cell service required. 

I even use it sometimes when I’m home- had a cable guy fixing my service last week, and instead of running upstairs every ten minutes I was able to drop in and remind her that I’d be up soon.
My friend used one woth her mom.  She said it worked well.
We used one with my FIL, who'd had a stroke and tended to sit in the same place all day. It worked out well, though we were always the ones who had to make the call. 

It's not super-seamless - sometimes it will say ""do you mean xxx"", which leads to a lot of rabbit-hole challenges - but it worked well enough.
Similar to another comment my husband is still at home but I use the drop-in function on the Alexa Show which Portal doesn't have, this means he doesn't have to figure out how to answer and can just talk to me directly. He can't recall the commands to call out with it so we have some written down he can look at but he tends not to bother.",2021-11-02 01:27:58,ThrowAwayQ23423443,qkxa07
Alzheimers,Hid from Mom’s decline; regrets.,"Starting down the path with my Mom so many of you have already tread. Thanks to this sub in advance for putting yourselves out there. A lot to learn and a long ways to go. 

I’ve been avoiding my Mom’s cognitive decline as long as possible. I thought I was hiding from the warning signs with her. I thought I’d been following her lead and she would bring it up when she was ready. I thought she was scared and didn’t want to tell anyone, and so the best I could do was just make sure she was comfortable. I thought I was hiding for her—I was doing it for me. 

I have avoided the issue more than I even knew. I wanted to believe she was capable and understanding of what was happening to her. I wanted to be supportive without forcing her to do anything she didn’t want to do. I talked to her about “letting me know if anything is ever wrong”, having great conversations and being ready to tackle the issue when the time came. And so long as she wasn’t telling me there were any issues, I pretended it was fine. I feel so dumb now. 

It occurs to me now just how little she might understand of what is happening to her. How scary it must be. Shes not hiding from it; it’s now hidden from her. She can’t fully bring it up because she doesn’t know. She’s still my mom, but the part of her that’s missing is the part I was not fully prepared for.

It started with erratic decision making about six years ago. Big decisions unlike her. Major cross-country moves to places she didn’t know anyone. Suddenly. She had some personal trauma, so erratic didn’t seem so far off at the time. I didn’t know. 

Three years later and the longtime forgetfulness and other behaviors were noticeable in a new way. Conversations became more repetitive, shorter, less depth and breadth. Questions were repeated. She became more deeply fixated on a fewer number of things. She got nervous easily. Still didn’t know. 

Two years ago and Mom was reluctant to get together for the holidays. I forced her to come see her family. She was nervous and uncomfortable. She seemed unable to follow the basic plan. She missed the first shuttle to come get her because she just lost track of the days. I chastised her for it and got her on the next one. I was confused how anyone could mess it up. She was a bit difficult the whole time. She repeated conversations to a more alarming degree. I knew something was wrong but didn’t do or say anything. 

18 months ago she completely reversed her cross country move but the planning and execution were a mess. She planned for
Months. A week before her move she called me asking me to fly out and move her because she had no plan. I scolded her for being so careless. Five days later she had driven 7 hours to my doorstep on the way to her destination. She was just standing there at 10:30 pm unannounced. We could not get a hold of her the prior four days. I yelled at her because I just didn’t understand what was happening. It was so erratic. She said it was stress. I thought about it later and started talking to people about cognitive decline and realized I had been less than helpful to her by scolding her. I still didn’t do or say anything. She seemed better and manageable for a while and I was just scared. 

All through covid we had been in touch but the calls became so short. I had been supportive but not direct with her. She would just repeatedly ask if we had gone back to work yet or if our state had been opened back up. Every call—Usually 3+ times per call. And I just kept asking if she was okay. We just kept repeating ourselves. She also started becoming very suspicious and her Facebook turned into a Qanon feed. Our calls dwindled over the last six months. 

Today I got a call from her landlord. He stopped by to get rent. Mom couldn’t figure out why he was there. She wasn’t sure what she was supposed to do so she asked him to write the check out for her. I logged in to Facebook to see two of her friends had reached out to tell me they were worried about her cognitive decline. She had gotten very sickly looking too. That she had withdrawn from everyone lately. 

I called my Mom right away. She was puzzled and upset by her TV not working and that was all she would talk about. Nothing else. I asked if she was okay. She said she just couldn’t figure out the TV. Over and over. Told her I was going to come visit this week to see if she is okay. She told me to wait til the TV was working. That we will talk tomorrow when TV works. I have never had a conversation like that with her. It’s like the echo of a person. There’s just someone distant and strange on the other end talking about the TV. It happened so fast. I had to get it off my chest. I feel guilty and stupid for not understanding the gravity and acting sooner. 

Tomorrow I will be calling her again and making plans to travel to her. I will be reaching out to Alz support tomorrow and to her doctor hopefully as well. 

And for the first time I am seeing what this really is and how terrible and confusing and frightening it must be for my Mom. 

The end. If you suspect an issue, don’t wait. Don’t hide. Have an honest conversation about it.","Thank you for taking the time to write out your thoughts on this. I know it wasn't easy, but I hope it was helpful or cathartic at some level.

I'm sorry you're going through this, it's terrible, for everyone involved. And honestly, they're is so little in the way of resources or help to turn to when your ready. No one knows how to even begin to deal with something like this. The really lucky ones have someone in the family who has been through it before to give advice.

First, get her to a doctor. Second, and this is so important, your going to need to be able to make legal and medical decisions for her. Get a power of attorney and medical power of attorney and directive in place immediately. This is so much harder to do later if/when she's not able to sign the paperwork. Sounds like she might resist, but just reassure her that you're there to help, and this will help take things off her plate.

Don't feel bad for anything, no one is prepared for something like this. I wish I had more advice but I am also feeling my way through this, like so many are forced to do. Take it one day at a time, take care of yourself, empathize with her as you make decisions, and base them on what you would want your child to do for you in the same situation. 

I'm not sure where you are in the world, but my experience with the US healthcare system has been horrifying. My mom has absolutely nothing, and so she means nothing to most of the state and local agencies. Hopefully it's better in places where there is some form of universal healthcare. But my advice would be to try to find people in the system as you go, for example when my mom fell and broke her hip we got introduced to a social worker in the hospital who had some experience, and it was literally the first time in two years we've been able to find anyone whose goal was not to either get money from us or pass us off to someone else.

Wishing you and your mom the best, I know this may be the hardest thing you've had to face. But you'll get through it.
For what it's worth, I have lived the flip side of this situation where I was very direct with my mom when I started seeing signs of cognitive decline years ago. Any attempts I made to get her to discuss Alzheimer's, dementia or to see a doctor were met with ""I am just getting older, this is what happens when you get older"" or some variant thereof. I eventually managed to get her to see a neurologist via telemedicine who diagnosed her with early Alzheimer's, but she does not want to take any medication or make any lifestyle changes, so it has not changed her situation. The end result is that I generated a lot of stress for her in discussing this with her and those discussions had no appreciable benefit to her long term outlook. It gave me some piece of mind to confirm what I am dealing with, but that's about it.
When I saw my mom, a woman who balanced her checkbook to the penny for   over 50 years, who could tell you the price of anything at the store, not be able to make change, I was heartbroken.  I’m 62 now and just 13 years away from where my mom was then.  I know she was scared.  I’m scared too.  Hopefully, my kids, having been thru this once will be as kind to me as they were to their Grandma.
❤️❤️❤️
My mom lives in an independent living facility, has been there for the last 8 years. She moved in with my dad who was already diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The idea was that when his condition declined, he would eventually move into the skilled nursing/""nursing home"" part. He moved into skilled nursing 6 years ago and passed away 4.5 years ago. 
This week my mother spoke to a nurse at the facility- she felt her memory was a problem, and she had difficulty handling bills. The nurse gave her the MOCA test and she scored a 20, which is Mild Cognitive Impairment. She is 85, so it's not a huge surprise but still kind of freaked out that we are starting to go down that road. I already went through the long goodbye with my dad, just sad that it looks like I will dealing with it again. I am lucky in terms of her situation in many other ways, but still hard to figure out what the road ahead looks like. Thank to the OP for sharing, just joined the sub.
that's tough. my mom keeps asking at every opportunity, no signs of covid? she's otherwise sharp though but i fear that the long goodbye is coming.
I know this comment is very late but I wanted you to know how much I appreciate your post. I’ve been in a similar situation with my mom and have been feeling very guilty about avoiding the issue for too long. Thank you for putting this all into words. It’s so helpful to know I’m not the only person who feels this way.",2021-11-02 01:30:04,nawtch2,qkxb4a
Alzheimers,Should I tell my dad his dog died?,"My dad has moderate stage Alzheimer’s. He has been in the hospital and rehab for over a month now. He is going home soon and he is now asking about his dog. His dog passed away shortly after he went to the hospital. Is it better to just directly tell him the dog died? Should I just tell him the dog is ‘away?’ I’ve seen conflicting information online, and I really can’t figure out what’s best.","Will he remember in a few days that his dog died? If so, yes, probably tell him.  If he won’t remember and you have to tell him over and over, then spare him the pain of having to go through those emotions over and over and say at the kennel, getting groomed. Etc.
I got my mom a stuffed lion(ess) at the dollar store that looked like the dog she could no longer take care of. She adores it; never even acted like it wasn't real or the former dog. That was a couple of years ago and she still holds it and talks to it.
How sad.

If you can find it in your heart to adopt a dog, you might offer him a chance to get a new one - knowing you will be its actual caregiver.  Pets are wonderful comforts for Alzheimer's patients.  When the disease is quite advanced, even a stuffed toy that looks like their pet is a loved substitute.

My spouse is middle stage and would know the difference if we lost either of our pets.  He loves them so much!
No
Get another dog that looks like dad's dog or be prepared to remind him his dog died several times a day for the next several years.   Either that or put a picture of the dog on the wall with R.I.P and the dates if he can still read if you want him to try to remember.  He won't.
No absolutely not
Oh, sorry bout that.  I think it largely depends on your dads state.  A combination of sharrkeybratwurst & Synamin, perhaps.   

It might be better to bite the bullet & tell him, have a nice doggy memorial ready - like a photo in a frame with some ribbons &/or fake flowers attached, if you have a garden then a spot in the the garden with a doggy statue & RIP fake flowers or whatever... 

But if yr dad is further gone, then yeh, as sharrkeybratwurst said, tell him it's away - but you'll have to tell him that a million times a day... Maybe make a framed photie of doggy, with ""coming home next week"" written on it... idk... Sad, so sorry.
No.
If that news will agitate him or create anxiety then don't.

Just work around it as much as possible, maybe remove anything that could remind him.

It's just hard sorry.
My husbands cat died a few weeks before my husband did.  It was devastating to him.  Daily he would go through the heartbreak over and over again when he would learn of it.   When I tried telling him the cat was in another room he would eventually try to go find it forgetting he could no longer walk on his own and almost injure himself.   In the end I fostered a cat that enjoyed being cuddled and while he knew it wasn’t his own, it made him calm and happy.",2021-11-01 16:41:35,blackopsbarbie,qkna8y
Alzheimers,My mom is moving in to a care home tomorrow. And she doesn’t want to at all.,"My mother (63 years) has been sick for many years now. My father cannot manage taking care of her anymore, so tomorrow she’s moving into a care home next door from my father. She doesn’t want to move now, even though she initially said yes. She is in need for professional care, and my father is so so tired and worn out from taking care of her. 

She has been so angry with us all day today, and she even said that she would kill herself if she had to move. 

I’m so sad for her. And him. I live in another part of our country, and have a family of my own, so it’s not possible for me to just stay here and take care of her. Right now I’ve taken some time of from my job, left my husband and two small kids at home, so I can be here when she is moving in tomorrow. 

I hate Alzheimer’s. I hate that it took my mom. And I wish she was happy and didn’t feel sad and anxious all the time.","It’s a tough situation to be in. We moved my dad into his “apartment with help” back in March, and he’s gone back and forth on whether he likes it or not. Currently, he says it’s great and he has a lot of friends there. It’s 100% the right place for him to be. 

My mother heard a statistic two years ago that 63% of Alzheimer’s care givers will die before the patient. Turns out, it’s 70% for those over 70. My mom died suddenly last November 24th. The toll on the caregiver is tremendous. By putting her in a safe place, you are likely extending your father’s life. It will be a roller coaster, but that’s all part of the process.

Good luck tomorrow.
Im sorry you are going through this. We had to move my stepmom away from my dad for the same reason. It was hard. He didn’t want it. She didn’t want it. We didn’t want it. But there was literally no other answer. It weighed on my mind for so long, trying to find an answer that isn’t there. Trying to think of a solution to make everyone happy.  I hope that you are kind to yourself while  going through this. It’s awful and the last thing you need is to be hard on yourself. Prayers for you
I’m so sorry. Though my mother has not had to move yet, it’s coming. She has said similar things and I think she has a suicide plan for when the time comes. I struggle with whether or not to tell my family members that I know this. I am the only one she is open with because I tell her that at the end of the day I respect her autonomy. I don’t know how I will handle it when I am in your shoes. I wish you peace and strength in this difficult time.
This is common. I've worked with dementia sufferers for many years, and I just want to warn you for a decline in cognitive ability relatively soon, and sometimes severe.

I understand your mother is mad, and it's totally understandable from her point of review. You have to remind yourself that with Dementia, you lose the ability to see things as they truly are, and self reflection and the ability to be self aware are the first things to go. 

There are literally millions of people who are suffering from Alzheimer's, and they either don't know it,  or refuse to admit anything is wrong. 

Just know that you are doing the right thing. Eventually, she will forget about being angry. If she had the ability to be introspective, she would be more accepting.


I always offer anyone on here to send me an IM if they need to talk. Please feel free to do so.
My mom hated it too and made many comments about killing herself. She was 10 years into her diagnosis when my dad passed away unexpectedly. He'd had a stroke, she had no idea how to help him or even call 9-11. Thankfully, someone happened to be at the house when it happened and was able to help out. Once he died, it was clear that we were unable to help her in the way she needed and still hold jobs, we were also way too young to even consider retiring.

Give it time, though. After six or eight weeks, she was happier. She'd made friends and when I went to visit her, she'd tell me she had plans with friends and that she was sorry, but I could leave now. It was the happiest I'd seen her in years, so it delighted me.",2021-10-31 19:05:31,Liserie,qk0z93
Alzheimers,My grandmother doesn’t recognize my mom (her daughter) anymore. How can I cheer my mom up?,My grandmother lives in assisted living because her dementia is too far gone to live on her own. My mom and her sisters take turns visiting and caring for her. My nom hates visiting because my grandmother doesn’t know her anymore. I’ve never seen my mom be emotional but she’s cried about it before and I know she dreads visiting and feels like a bad daughter because she doesn’t go as often as she should because it’s so hard on her. What can I do to support her after these visits? We aren’t really a family who talks about our feelings a lot and that wouldn’t be comfortable for her. How would you want to be supported? Is there anything I can do at all to make her feel better? It breaks my heart.,"Oh goodness, it's so hard when the LO loses the ability to recognize loved ones. I remember when my grandma asked me how we met, I was crushed. And eventually she didn't know me at all. The only person she remembered until the end was my sister and even then it was ""that tall girl"". 

What I took comfort in was that my grandma was always comfortable with me, even if she didn't think she knew me. On some level, she still knew I was important to her and a safe person. I would bring her little treats (ice cream was her favorite) and talk to her while she ate it. I just used a calm voice and told her about crafts I was working on or other simple happy things. She couldn't follow my stories anymore and I didn't ask her questions since she couldn't answer them, but I think it soothed her to have that kind of familial relationship anyway. 

If your grandma is still comfortable with your mom, that's a sign she knows that your mom is important to her, even if she can't figure out why. It's a bitter comfort but it did help. 

And also, it's totally ok to be sad about that loss. Dementia causes a slow painful grief for the family and it's ok to acknowledge that.
If your grandmother still knows she is someone safe, that's something special.
There's no way to really cheer you mum up. She's grieving and speaking from personal experience, it's harder than grieving when someone has died because this is a strange, ongoing sort of grief that isn't really recognised by the world outside of those in a dementia bubble. 

I feel awful whenever I have to visit my mum in her care home. I try to visit weekly but it's really tough and my instincts tell me to protect myself by not visiting, and pretend as if she's gone already because that's how it feels to me. I have to make a real effort to ignore those instincts and I feel awful that that's how I feel about visiting my own mother, but it's the truth. She doesn't recognise me and a lot of the time, she doesn't even recognise that I'm someone that she knows.

If I visit at the wrong time for her medication (which is sometimes the only time I can get through depending on my work hours), she can either be asleep or highly anxious and trying to escape, at which point a visit is impossible because she can't process anything that's happening around her.

So, no, unfortunately I don't think there's any way you can really cheer your mum up when she's going through all those feelings. What you can do though is be there to support her and allow her to talk about her feelings, and help her realise that there is no shame in anything that she might be feeling, because whatever it is, it is totally valid. It's a horrible, shitty situation and there is no correct way to feel about any of it.",2021-10-31 10:51:52,anxiouslucy,qjr3pc
Alzheimers,Predatory marriage PT 2: Red lines drawn and crossed,"&#x200B;

Hello Redditors

Thank you on behalf of my fam for your input on Part I. We are listening and open to any ideas you may have.

Update:

Since last post, N (F 70) has spent a great deal of time with my Dad, P. (M 77) who has moderate / mild Stage 5 Alz. This woman is still pushing him to complete redecoration of his condo, which at one point  discombobulated him so much that his caretaker reported that he left the condo thinking it was someone else's home and then headed for the curb where the car he hasn’t owned since 2018 should be parked. The redecoration was estimated by his finance person to cost him 40K.

We had originally decided that indications he was going to marry her would be our redline, warranting us getting a lawyer to pursue conservatorship to protect him from further exploitation and perhaps even annul the marriage? The family that would help us to get this lawyer is not financially connected to P.

However, that redline had to be redrawn because N did something so incredibly outrageous that no one really expected it - she got him to open a joint account at his bank and transferred over 16K into it. This opens the floodgates to N having him transfer every penny into this account which she can then empty, this being a far more efficient way to fleece my Dad than waiting months to meet the two requirements of a confidential (not on public record and hidden until his passing) marriage in CA: changing her residence to his address and calling herself Mrs P.

At the same time, P also spent several hours calling the credit card companies and cancelling the cards he had sent to his adult kids back before N. came into his life. Apparently he is having cashflow problems because of the condo redecoration and enormous 9k per mo caretaker bill. N told him it is your kids and the credit cards you gave them so problem solved.

Thing is, P. has real problems keeping track of all the CC he has opened over the past few years, and the ones N told him to close because of his kids also pay for his utilities and caretaker expenses.

It is likely that the utilities and bills will stay unpaid until they start coming due and then there will be darkness and silence in my Dad's condo and no one to answer any questions because the company that runs the caretakers are hardasses and will pull them out asap.

The best part is the CC were all known to his accountant and monitored and paid through Quickbooks. Any new cards he ordered now will go straight to P and not be monitored. So far, N has removed the physical devices meant to keep him safe from running off, and has now removed the accounting system which kept him safe from financial scams.

Today the fam did a call and we decided that J (his youngest son M 50)  would offer P. a chance to voluntarily accept conservatorship so he can be protected and still do whatever, including getting legally married to this “person” if he really wants.

We expect him to tell N, who will pressure him to resist, making her the only person telling P to not cooperate with his fam. She has already advised him to tell us to fuck off and that it is his right to get married to whoever he wishes. He is 1000% in love with her and will do whatever she asks.

The plan is after he tells us off, that's when we hand this off to a lawyer and say to a court or judge that given his diagnosis is there any way to at the very least stop him from moving money around and first explain where it is going and why.

I have to say I don't see much hope here. This is actually the THIRD time he has been involved with such a difficult and demanding woman like N. His first marriage after he divorced my mom was to a N. He was totally lovestruck and acted pretty much the same long before his present diagnosis.

We appreciate any thoughts or impressions you may have.

edit: Del name","If you're in the US, a lawyer can help you become his guardian and you can wipe this woman out of his life. I'd get a restraining order based upon her activities to date. He will forget she exists soon enough, sadly. 

I've dealt with a similar situation (in our case a marriage) and the abuse and neglect of my mom, who has Alzheimer's, was enough to convince her partner that _not_ contesting the guardianship was better than being arrested. My mother was appointed a separate lawyer by the court and worked with us in the best interest of my mother. 

Settling the estate was quite difficult as her husband had, over time, rolled all of her retirement into his accounts as was his right even after her diagnosis.

It's much easier to handle before the finances are co-mingled.
We went through a very similar situation with our dad - it’s so painful and you have my empathy.

Laws & procedures can vary by state, so I don’t know if this will help you, but may be something to check. Have you seen your dad’s full will and associated end-of-life legal documents? 

In our case, he had a specific document concerning guardianship specifying who would serve that role and that it would go into effect when 2 doctors attested that he was no longer capable to represent his own interests. 

We resisted using it for years, but eventually had to work with his docs to trigger this provision for his safety. It also applied to all business & financial matters. Your sibling with medical POA should be able to get the right documents from his medical team if your dad already had this guardianship provision in place.

Once this provision was triggered, we didn’t even need to go to court. We carried the packet of notarized legal documents plus the 2 notarized doctor attestations to every medical, financial, or legal meeting and were able to act on our dad’s behalf. This allowed us to stop the N person’s access to his accounts, etc., as well as to proceed with arranging additional care, new living arrangements, etc.",2021-10-30 20:15:11,COMMODOREXXX,qjdzz9

Alzheimers,Where to fax / send Health Care POA for purposes of U.S. Medicare / Medicaid?,"Can anyone point me in the right direction of where to fax / send Health Care POA for purposes of U.S. Medicare / Medicaid?

I called Medicare and they said to contact Social Security, because these are benefits, but Social Security is having long-term issues with their telephones, and, thus, can't get through. (I tried several times and they have a notice on their website about this.)

All I can find on the SS website is a form to fill out for someone who still has their faculties about them, and have also seen somewhere that they don't recognize POAs. My loved one has Alzheimers and it's too late for them to fill out the form.

I just want to fax the Health Care POA related to Medicare / Medicaid, so I can contact them on behalf of my parent in the future.

I don't have an urgent need to contact them right now, but am wanting to fax / transmit these to all who I might need this to be in place for. I've got a 7-day trial of an online fax service, and have faxed to all parties/entities but Medicare / Medicaid.

Alzheimers,Just looking for kind words. Story in comments,,"Just need to vent a bit and blatently ask for some positive feed back. Two issues really. The first is my wife has early onset of alzheimer's diagnosed  three years ago. Second is 96 year mother with age related dementia. I am the sole care giver for both and it has become difficult of late. 

No other family members to help out for mother . Brother works full time and does his best but mostly home repair for our Mom. She lives alone and will not move to assisted living facility. (This where you go to die, etc) Have a sister who is retired in another state. Ask her to come up to help and states that she is helping by saying a pray for me every day. (yeah, very very Catholic) I am in between what state and county resources can do for her.

Wife needs constant attention as most everyday tasks are now difficult.  (Lost phones, work the TV remote, basic computer usage, Getting lost outside, etc)

One bright spot is every morning when my wife comes done the stairs she gives me a big hug with a sincere 'I love You' 

Thanks for listening.
I’m so sorry. You really are in tough spot, you are great husband and son .My aunt always tells my siblings and cousins “you’ll never regret everything you’ve done for your….” fill in the blank,father, mother, sister…so many loved ones we’ve cared for over the years in their time of great need. Be strong, you are doing a good thing.
It's going to be harder every day, but the good days make up for the hardship.  I can only imagine how you're feeling when two of your most beloved are suffering from the same condition. You seem to love both of them very much, but you have to remember to take care of yourself. I don't know how it works in the US, but can you have someone come up to your house and help from the healthcare center? We had an assistant helping with the chores couple of times a week, which made things a lot easier.
Sending you so much love. There’s lots of tech that can help your wife be safer and more independent at this stage. It’s definitely worth looking into, to reduce the stress and burden for you both.
As a caregiver for my SO, I cannot imagine trying to manage two situations involving dementia. My goal is keeping my SO safe, and happy. I work to get a smile from her, to light up her sad, lonely eyes. My only helper is our dog, Daisy. 

Be strong, one day at a time, and remember the smiles.
You are doing amazing work, and it is work.  And there is so much grief involved too - I hope you have at least some small moments to yourself.  Hugs to you, and please try to take care of yourself as much as you can.  Bless you for taking care of both of these ladies.
Hugs to you and your family!   Please take care of yourself…I know too well that this situation leads to health problems and burnout for the caretaker.  Put your oxygen mask on first, then take care of everyone else.",2021-10-29 23:24:27,MyDogGoldi,qisxuy
Alzheimers,OAP proofing the childproof sockets (UK),"When grandma was a kid, her dad said she had to turn off everything at the wall at night to stop the power “leaking out” of the sockets. 
She has got it into her head (again) that this is true. 
I don’t mind her unplugging e.g. the toaster, obviously. But anything with a clock has to be reset every morning so she doesn’t get confused about the time. She will also turn off the washing machine and dishwasher in the middle of an overnight cycle so I get a mini flood when I open them.
More seriously, she turns off all the nightlights so she can’t see going to the loo. She turns off the phone base stations (sometimes we’ve missed incoming NHS calls because of this). Has even turned off the power of her emergency contact box “so it doesn’t call anyone”. That box detects it has lost power, and rings EVERYONE!

So, my problem is, that U.K. plugs are arguably the the safest in the world (https://youtu.be/UEfP1OKKz_Q). I want to make them less safe so grandma can’t turn them off at the socket or pull them out of the wall. Is there any box that can be fitted over the socket to stop her disconnecting the things that are supposed to help her?","I have this a Clippasafe Socket Protector which goes over the socket and plugs. It may not be suitable if your loved one is likely to open the box, but it may result in out of sight out of mind.  https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003TFCB6E/ref=cm_sw_r_awdo_navT_g_HR6ZEGPSCJ9QFY8SZZ5Y

Alzheimers,Someone I manage has a family member with Alzheimers,"I’m hoping this question is appropriate for this forum. I’m not asking from a management perspective ; but rather as another human being and a co-worker who cares because It’s clearly impacting their day to day.

I’ve read through many posts in this subreddit and they are both heartbreaking and heartwarming. The amount of support i see brings me to tears. 

What can I do in my position to help this individual? Or should I just leave it alone and  not mention it bc it’s not my business?","I have found it to be very heartwarming when my supervisor just listens and accepts that some days I’ll need to take extra phone calls occasionally. You won’t fully understand the experience unless you live through it (hope you never do) but it was always nice to hear “I can’t fully understand because I’m not in your situation, but I’m really sorry to hear that’s going on”. 

Wouldn’t say any of this in a public setting because it could be an emotional topic for them - I know I’ve cried at work because of the situation lol. 

Really great that you’re this caring - not all bosses are like that.
just be lenient and understanding! if they are a caregiver for this person, they might be a little late to work because they didnt want to get dressed. they might have to leave early if the caretaker at home cant handle something. they may have to take personal phone calls during the day to check in on them. 

this disease can be 3 months before death or 15 years if they are progressing slowly and are in good physical health. it takes a huge toll to watch your loved one decline like that and slowly forget who you are! be kind and patient and understand that their bad days are likely 100% because of this and nothing work related. 

you can also suggest to them that they reach out to the alzheimers association if they need help or answers or assistance finding other resources, like memory care homes. its free and has a 24 hour hotline. as a manager you dont need to do anything beyond this, it may make them feel guilty.
1st off thank you for thinking of your co-worker like this, it's good for all of us to know that people care.

Be lenient with fone use, any lateness or needing to finish early. I would also let them know you are willing to be a shoulder to lean on for any issues with finishing work tasks.

After that it's just about being a good person to them.
Let them know what their options are to make their work schedule more flexible and to take advantage of FMLA if necessary.  You could ask if they are a primary caregiver.  Let them know how much you value their time and hard work.  Showing that you care about their personal life and are willing to be flexible is huge.
One thing that I haven’t seen, and maybe it’s just me, but I hate it when people ask me how my dad is doing.

1. It’s f’ing Alzheimer’s, the true answer is NEVER going to be good.

2. Work is the last place in my life where I feel normal and have some form of control over. Most of the time I don’t want to mix lives. As a caregiver I want to be my own person for a few hours of the day. If I want to talk about it with you, you’ll know.

I know that people ask because they do care, but honestly it causes more harm sometimes.

That being said, my bosses are incredibly supportive of me and our struggles. Honestly I don’t know what I would do without them. So good for you, you are a good person!
Check with HR for little used programs and benefits that may apply.  Often these programs are created with other situations in mind but apply to Alzheimer’s situations but because we have a preformed idea in our head of what they do, we never apply for them or feel guilty applying for them.  If you find a program that can help pay for a medication, help with time off, please encourage your employee to use it.  A company I worked for had a program many workers donated to to help employees afford medical care that was named after an employee who had cancer when the program was founded.  I never considered that it applied to other situations, but it did.  We had a time off fund employees could donate PTO to for emergencies, that could be used for a caregivers mental health days etc.  A flexible manager might understand that today is a exceptionally bad day for someone to be away from their loved one and ask them to take care of a project that requires them to be away from the office, and just not share with the office that they are doing work from home after they have completed the project.  Even as simple as we are running low on X, could you pick it up along with this and since it’s close to your house just work from home this afternoon and bring it to the office tomorrow etc.
How nice of you to ask this! Thank you!

Focus on her, not her dad. Instead of asking, ""How's your dad doing?"" switch the focus and ask, ""How are you doing? How can I help you?""

Caregivers and family members are overwhelmed and grieving the loss of their loved one's awareness and the decline of their thinking processes -- yet they have to be strong enough to shelve their grief in order to keep functioning. Life's demands don't stop even though their worlds are upside down!

Because of that stress, when someone (especially a manager) asks what the stress is like and wants to listen and care, it's enough. There's no need to for you to come up with solutions or to offer suggestions, just listen and care!",2021-10-29 11:30:38,GenerallyGao,qifemc
Alzheimers,My dad believes he has early-stage Alzheimers...I'm not certain,"Dad (71) has said he think he has early-stage Alzheimers.  He stopped working part-time over a year ago now because he made a major mistake. He often looses track of where he's going when he's driving. Today he didn't realize that there were cars waiting at a light in front of him. My mom had to scream for him to realize they were going to crash, then swerve into another lane to avoid hitting the cars ahead. Today we discovered he'd ordered some boots from a fake company. He thought it was Etsy, but it was actually a look-a-like site called Etsy-Center.  Normally $300 boots being sold for $59. It's strange he didn't question if that was too good to be true.  He often forgets things, like he'll make a full pot of coffee and then leave.  He says that there's other things he's been hiding.  He's always had trouble remembering things, and needs to keep lists and reminders and to keep himself on track.  Social skills and language skills are very good.

I accept that there could be some kind of dementia that may be setting in, but I guess it's hard for me to accept it could be Alzheimers.  He's also a health nut, loves the gym, eats very mindfully and takes all manner of supplements. Everything from green tea and coconut oil to lifetime extension supplements.

I started looking up information on how to plan for a family member with dementia or Alzheimers. And it's all very vague, euphemistic stuff about considering your options and the individual's preferences. Tell it to me straight - what do we need to be doing now and in the coming years?  I have a young child and live nearby but I can't take on too much myself.","First, I'm sorry your going through this. All the signs are there and then some based on your description. The fact that he believes it means it should be taken very seriously.

The most important thing you can do right now is get him to a doctor and tell them what's going on. 

It is also key that at this point you put in place the means for you to be able to make decisions for him in the future. This means legally and medically. Do this right now while he's able to sign all the paperwork for a power of attorney and medical power of attorney. This is much much harder to do later if he's not able to sign.
He needs to see a doctor. Talk with him about medical and financial powers of attorneys now. 

Sorry this is all happening. I hate to say it but even people living a healthy lifestyle can get Alzheimer’s. My mom was literally a marathon runner, didn’t really drink, and ate pretty healthy. Still diagnosed with early onset when she was 63.
And it’s probably time to stop driving if he’s getting to the point where he can’t safely do it on his own.
He needs to get screened. Could be alzheimer's, could be normal aging. Sleep apnea, particularly in older adults, reduces functioning enormously. The sleep doctor we went to said he regularly saw miracles occur in adults who went on a sleep apnea machine, and within  a few weeks they were back to normal functioning. Heck, he could even just be very anemic, or recovering after a concussion for a fall he doesn't remember, or just plain depressed. Only the doctor can diagnosis it.

An important thing to remember is that Alzheimer's does not progress at the same rate for everyone. My grandma was diagnosed and dead from it within five years. My dad was diagnosed 11 years ago, and is still able to drive (passes yearly DMV tests) and live independently. You don't know how fast this will progress until you have all lived with it a while.

He needs to be diagnosed, you all need some time to absorb the shock, then you need to get your mom and dad to an attorney to get a will, trust, durable power of attorney, and advanced healthcare directive all sorted out. You need the attorney **now** while everyone is of a sound enough mind. Then you need to make some memories. 

There are other steps too, figuring out how to train mom to take over the finances, doing a purge of the house so that the simplest answer is always the correct one (toothpaste and toothbrush visible on the counter, absolutely no ointments that could be confused in the bathroom, a pair of his shoes next to every door out, tape over all non relevant buttons on the remote, etc.). These are going to occur naturally as it progresses.  Just worry about the stuff in the paragraph above for now. And realize taking care of your dad was always going to be a team sport. You, mom, the rest of the family, his friends, his church, the community, hired helpers, and the government are all going to work together to help him. You don't need to do everything, you will find your role in how to help. Lots of times one kid is the tech guru, or the person who makes appointments, or the one who handles the taxes, or maybe the respite caregiver two weeks of the year. There are a lot of ways to help, time will tell which role will best suit you and your family.
I'm really sorry; this is a horrible thing to deal with.

Alzheimer's happens to everybody, no matter how healthily they lived up to that point.   In any case, it doesn't matter whether your dad has Alzheimer's or some other dementia; what matters is that he  is losing the ability to live on his  own.

Take him to a doctor for a diagnosis.  It is possible he has some other medical condition -- which can include taking the wrong medications -- that is making it harder for him to think.   

Talk to him about what he'd like to do: what is important to him, and what does he need.   You will need a durable power of attorney for him, but it's something you have to ask for, not demand.  He may choose not to provide one.  If he's willing to talk about it, schedule a visit with a lawyer.
I'm wondering why you can agree it may be some type of dementia, but specifically Alzheimers is a bridge too far for you. 

Regardless of the type of dementia: if it's dementia it will be progressive. There is no cure, and it ends when someone dies. So what you can do is discuss this 'last phase' together. How will you signal that care needs to increase. Has he made a will, and a living testament? Other than that its a waiting game, and you can only tackle issues when they come up. He could still tell you a lot about his history now, as he will be traveling back in his mind, and it's good for caregivers to know about big life events, especially the painful ones. When will he stop driving? When is a care home indicated? What is your budget regarding in home care, and start it before his partner gets caregivers burnout. Just a weekly hour of an 'adult sitter' can already help gauging if more is needed. This means his partner can freely leave the house and run an errand, or have a coffee with a friend. That type of respite is very, very helpful and a little goes a long way, if started on time.
Does your dad have a lot on his mind or is he stressed about anything?  Is it possible he's more distracted?

While Alzheimer's is certainly possible at his age, most people are unaware of their deficits when they actually have Alzheimer's disease.  It is called anosognosia and is a common occurrence in AD.  When someone themselves is worried about their memory and others remain unconvinced, this is a good sign.  It could be either stress, depression /anxiety or just worried well.

He could always be screened by a neurologist.  The MOCA is an effective screening tool when administered correctly.
1. You may want to look into long term care insurance or supplementary insurance prior to doing anything else, once you are diagnosed you can't effectively do anything. 

2. Go to a neurologist. They will run a battery of tests and give you an initial diganosis. Causes of dementia are wide and Alzheimer's is just a possibility ranging from pseudodementias caused by conditions like depression which are reversible to an extent, to vascular causes to Alzheimer's to other things. Its extremely important to get evaluated.

3. Ask your neurologist to recommend an MRI with neuro-quant - this should be pretty standard but for whatever reason some practitioners don't do it.

4. If diagnosed with AD you may want to pay for further testing for certain proteins that are indicative of the disease. 20% of AD diagnoses are incorrect, and in fact made with memory tests alone, or with MRI + memory tests. You have 3 options here, the most expensive being a PET scan (~$2500-$4000), the most invasive - a LP ($800), the easiest but potentially less accurate - blood test ($1000).

An alternative is to immediately check for availability in your area of Clinical Trials that are informational in nature. There are occasionally informational studies by NIH and others that will net you free PET scans/genetic testing etc.

5. It may be useful for you and your father to do a genetic test to check for biomarkers for AD. There's some recent research that indicates that treatment and dietary protocols should be different based on specific genetic types. (Google: APOE4+)

6. Right now getting diagnosed earlier is much better - there is a much better chance of landing in good clinical trials, there appears to be a much better chance of slowing disease progression via lifestyle modifications if still in the MCI/Mild phases etc. 

7. While I've seen people derive a lot of benefit from supplements  - one thing I would be wary of is supplement quality. You want to make sure that if you're spending $$ on things which may or may not have an effect, you aren't potentially doing yourself harm by ingesting contaminants that could be neurotoxins. I'd advise him to only use supplements that have 3rd party lab testing.
It's been said a couple time but get him to see a doctor. Make an appointment sooner rather than later. I'm going through this with my mother currently. We started with her regular doctor who referred us to a specialist. We had to wait 9 months to see the specialist. My mother definitely declined a bit while waiting for that appointment. We have a new appointment this coming week that we waited another 3 months for. We might finally get a prescription that MAY slow the progress. At this point my mother is incontinent now (forgot to mention I moved her in with me and my family, that's a whole different conversation). I wish I would have started this process a couple of years ago when I first started seeing signs. Maybe we could have kept her a bit closer to normal if I started sooner.
It’s good to consider supplements to help be proactive about symptoms of Alzheimer’s.
Check out NeuroQ, it’s natural and clinical shown to improve memory and contains natural things like turmeric, gotu kola and gingko bilobia :)

Alzheimers,A Question About Self Diagnosis,"Hello nice people. I have a question that may sound silly, but I am kind of a person who would prefer talking to real people if not paid doctors rather than internet articles.

Do you guys remember the first times you were aware that you started forget things? 

I am 29 and I started to forget the names of the foods that I know very well, the district names of my hometown etc… These kinds of things. 

I lost my grandmom a while ago due to this disease, and I am a little afraid if I may have it too. I don’t sleep early at all since 5 years, always 3-6 am, and I sleep 10 hours. Or sometimes I am up for 2 days and sleep 18 hours. Due to nature of my work. 

I appreciate any response. Take care!","You are awfully young to have alzheimer's signs. Other issues can cause dementia symptoms, such as depression/anxiety or thyroid problems. Please see a doctor and at least get some blood work up.
Are your memory problems specifically related to word-finding? All the examples you shared above are. 

Word-finding problems and anomic aphasia type symptoms can be caused by a range of things from sleep deprivation(!), untreated sleep apnea, depression/anxiety and various medications to more serious things like head injuries, mini strokes, tumours etc. At your age and with only this symptom, Alzheimer’s is one of the least likely possibilities. So take a breath - I do think it’s unlikely to be anything serious. 

Still, it’s always worth talking to your GP about your symptoms. Keep a list of occurrences for a week or so on your phone so you can show them what you’re experiencing, and how frequently. Mention any ways it’s affecting your ability to work/take care of yourself/function.

Depending on severity of symptoms I’d be looking for a referral either to neurology or speech and language therapy for further investigation, but at this stage, I really don’t think you need to worry too much. 

In the meantime, a tip for when you’re struggling to find a word - try and talk *around* the word you’re looking for. Eg, if you can’t remember the word for “pyramids”, list all the things you CAN remember about them, like Egypt, camels, sand, triangles, ancient, stone, etc. Describe the colour, texture, materials etc to yourself. Often this process will help the word come back to mind, and over time, you can train your brain to access your mental lexicon more quickly with this technique :)

Source: am an ex speech and language therapist
Hmm. No offense, but that's kinda too young to have Alzheimer's. If it *is* dementia of some sort, it would be frontotemporal, as that can affect people under the age of 65. I'm not 100% sure if you *do* have it, I'm not a licensed professional of any sort, but I can say that it's most likely not dementia, but if it is, then it's most likely frontotemporal; but check with a doctor just to be sure.

Alzheimers,My dad died Sunday after a long battle with Alzheimer’s,I’m a wreck. that’s all. seeing posts here where i used to check for help breaks me even more.,"Alzheimer's is a slow motion killer. We see it coming. We know it is going to take of loved one's life. We think that try he years of pain, watching our loved one slip away, has made us immune to the finality of dead, but in the end, it hurts even more. 

In the coming days, may you find peace, as now your father isn't suffering any more.
I just lost my dad a few weeks ago. I thought since he had the disease for almost 10 years, that when the day came It would be easier. It wasn’t. It’s so many goodbyes. When you first learn that they have It you dread the outcome goodbye, when they start forgetting it’s the dad you grew up with goodbye, then when they physically pass it’s the final goodbye. It’s just not fair.  I feel selfish sometimes when people tell me well he’s not suffering anymore or he’s in a better place because I think I wish he was still here.  So sorry for you loss. You’re not alone 💜
The long goodbye is very tough to go through.
I’m sorry for your loss.

As a resident of heaven, he no longer suffers from ANY disease. He now feels healthier than he has ever been. Everyone ought to be grateful now that he no longer suffers but instead feels joy and peace that surpasses any level of that which could've been felt on earth.
Sorry for your loss. This is why we need to accelerate approvals for existing Alzheimer's drugs (which actually work) in development. Eventually, some of us or someone we know may reach that same fate.",2021-10-28 01:56:07,yeauxleauxx,qhg8w5
Alzheimers,Dealing with a difficult primary caregiver,"I’m 36 and my dad was diagnosed with alz last year, at 76. He lives a 25 hour drive or flight away, and I am the primary caregiver of 2 kids under 6, so visiting him regularly is not really possible. 

I’m struggling because his primary caregiver (long term partner, previously known as my step-mother) is a toxic person. I won’t go into the whole back story because it would be way too long, but for the first year after he was diagnosed, she and I spoke regularly and she kept me up to date on his progress and was open about her feelings. Then in the spring they sold their home and moved closer to her daughter (which I was very happy to hear, as previously they were very isolated). But during the move she started avoiding my calls, saying she was too busy to talk. Which I’m sure she was. 

But now it’s been nearly five months and she still refuses to talk to me. She won’t answer the phone and she hides whenever I am talking to my dad, so if I ask to speak to her, he just wanders around calling her name but she refuses to come to the phone.

My dad is lucid and seems happy, but I am well aware this is not the whole story. He has never been much of a conversationalist, and now our discussions are limited to a few high level ideas he repeats - mostly how nice his dog is, and how dry the weather has been.

I just... have no idea if they have any support. I have no idea how his symptoms are progressing. I have no idea how she is handling the stress of being his caregiver. Based on her behaviour over the past 25 years, I am fairly confident the answer is “not well.” I have suspected she has undiagnosed bipolar or manic depression for a long time. 

I worry she will not tell me if / when he begins to decline. 

I don't even know how I would be able to coordinate a visit to go see them. Do I just book a flight and show up at their house unannounced? 

Anyway... thank you for listening. If you have any advice on what I can do, I will gladly listen.","Do you have any contact with her daughter? Maybe get in contact with her and let her know your concerns without overtly badmouthing her mother. She might have some insight why your step-mother is being so elusive and hopefully act as an advocate for you in the situation.
This is a legal issue and I suggest you contact some lawyers that specialize in this area.  


Getting ahold of any trust or will is crucial as a part of getting power of attorney for him.  
Once that happens everything else will fall into place (reasonably)",2021-10-27 13:02:22,mangoparadox,qh1asg
Alzheimers,What does your in-home caregiver help with?,"My dad is the full-time caregiver for my mom. Mom is progressing rapidly and we're trying to get Dad some help. What do you have your in-home helper do?  

My mom is super-resistant to the idea that she needs help - but Dad can't get anything done around the house when she's there and home.  We really just need someone to distract her, but Mom's not going to sit and talk calmly with anyone for a couple of hours, nor will she let anyone give her a bath or do chores she thinks she can do (dishes, trash, clean, etc).  

Thanks!","My dad had to get help with my mom, it's really hard. She would empty the dishwasher and my mom would ""help"" or ask my mom to go on a walk with her. Or sit and go through photos...that was HUGE. Then she would spend hours just telling her about who was in the photos or whatever. 

My dad had to first put it in the premise of this lady was a friend who was coming over to have ""coffee"" and they would just all 3 sit and chat. Then my dad was slyly get up and go do something else until my mom felt comfortable with her, or them (sometimes a few people rotated).
I used to work for an aging and disability non profit and a large part of our organization was finding in home help. They usually helped with things like laundry, errands such as groceries, tidying things up, and meal prep. Another big thing was just having someone around for more socialization. 

At least in the state of Maine it was relatively well tracked what they were doing. I don’t know if they would have been paid for doing things outside of those duties.
I am primary giver for my grandmother in our home. I have someone who comes 3 days a week to relieve me so I can work and do chores or errands. While she’s here, she watches my grandmother, takes her to the bathroom and gives her meals. She also will do my grandma’s laundry, empty the dishwasher and tidy up our kitchen and living room area as needed when she has a lot of downtime.",2021-10-27 13:05:03,KLK1712,qh1cys
Alzheimers,Dad getting kicked out of memory care; need advice,"Hey all, I know these stories are a dime-a-dozen (I've read through all of them on this subreddit) but here we are with another. I'm really struggling with this. My dad suddenly had a bout of aggression a couple weeks ago and there were a few incidents of him harming residents and staff. He was good for about a week and the facility said they would keep trying to balance out his meds (he's been checked for infection, etc), that we had time and they'd work with us. Well, another incident happened yesterday and we are being asked to find him a new facility IN ADDITION to hiring a 24/7 caregiver to be there with him until we can move him. As you may know, caregivers are expensive so it'll run over $800/day plus the facility costs right now. 

I, and the facility, have called many places for help; they wanted to send him to the hospital but we have his advanced directives as ""comfort only"" and the EMT's said the hospital wouldn't do anything; not to mention most hospitals around here are on divert because of COVID. I've spoken to all the local geriatric psychiatric units and NONE of them deal with folks with dementia. We need someone willing to help us balance out his meds AND take in a man with an aggression issue. Thankfully the facility has decided he qualifies for a hospice eval (we all suspect he's stage 7) and I should be meeting with them tomorrow. I'm hoping hospice will have some resources for me. There is one skilled nursing facility who said they'd be willing to take him but it's $12,000/month and WAY out of our price range. 

I'm really stuck. Anything I haven't thought of? My local area agency on aging has not been helpful and neither Alz Association. Thanks, friends. Elder care in this country is a disgrace.","I've been there. I was actually invited to be on our local Alzheimer's chapter's advisory panel because I had almost an identical situation to yours with my mom and the ALZ Association, agency for aging, and state's ombudsman were all useless. I have a cousin going through the exact same thing right now with her mom, and her mom is threatening to stab them to death including their toddler.

In our case, the assisted living place actually dropped my mom in the ER check-in area without telling me and left her there. The hospital called me to ask what I wanted to do. You have to be very clear and say he's a danger to himself and others and therefore cannot be in your home. That's what they try to do, get you to take your parent home so that he/she's not their problem. I'd had a social worker tell me specifically to use the words - ""She's a danger to herself and my family. We cannot take her.""

My mom was immediately placed in the geriatric psychiatric wing and assessed. They found that none of her meds were working and moved to Haldol as a last resort. Haldol worked. With that, the social worker got to work finding her housing in a Medicaid memory care wing out of state where the staff were better trained for anger issues. She's been there for coming on a year now and the calls to me that were happening daily stopped. She was calmer and managing her moods better through occupational therapy sessions and psychiatric sessions. When I stopped in to see her, I could see a bit of the old mom coming through and not the she-demon she'd become.

She's now entered the final stage and is no longer mobile. They stopped her meds and I have clear instructions now for end-of-life care that she's not to go to the hospital, no treatment for serious  infections, and no feeding tubes. When I saw her a week ago, she only said one word to me (her pet name for me), which was surprising to the staff as they hadn't heard her talk in weeks, but it was heartwarming to hear her call me that.
I'm always surprised when facilities meant to house dementia patients don't seem to know what goes with it. My dad swings from being sexually inappropriate to aggressive. Thankfully his caregivers so far shrug it off. I wish I knew what to tell you. I hope you get the help you need.
Thanks for sharing
I had this same situation. My dad was put in memory care after my mom fell. They could not handle him. They were calling me every day saying he was going into peoples rooms and complaining that he was too busy. They could not handle him. He got aggressive with a caregiver and they put him in the behavioral psych ward. I had to fly and get him and bring him closer to me. I put him in another facility that was supposed to be one of the best memory cares. The place was not ran well. The caregivers were miserable and my dad paid the price. They over medicated him to control him and he would be sleeping for days. I moved him again and It was like night and day. The facility is ran so well and the caregivers really cared about him. Unfortunately he declined a lot this year with all the moves and he only lived in the new place for a few months before he passed away. I’m so glad he was there and not at the other place. I have regrets not putting him there in the first place.  The facility and how the caregivers are trained make a huge difference. If you can start hospice I HIGHLY recommend It. I didn’t know anything about hospice before and my dad was in hospice for about 5 mos and they helped soooo much. They were also a great support system for me.  They are seriously angels. Such a great resource. If he can start hospice definitely do that. They will help figure out meds too to help with his aggression.",2021-10-27 09:34:59,chirp16,qgwtzl
Alzheimers,How to get through knowing your father doesn’t know who you are.,"Title says all. All the memories I created with my dad, he has forgotten. Every 10 minutes he asks who I am and where I’m from. I always put a smile on my face saying its your son dave!! and he gets all happy about how he raised such a good son, and then it just repeats thruout the day. It’s getting difficult keeping a smile on my face. All i want to do is cry","Sending you hugs! It's really hard to caregive when they don't know who you are. Can I give you a peek into a sadly possible route it might take, based on what's happened with my mom? I actually miss the times that you're describing since you said he smiles and says that he raised such a good son, once you tell him who you are. My mom used to do that before, but now it can have multiple outcomes: maybe she'll smile and say ""ohh"", maybe she look frustrated and confused and insist on seeing her parents (who have long passed), maybe she'll get angry and not believe me. I'm really sorry you're going through this. Dementia is such an unfortunate situation all around. And I'm sure you've come to see that it only gets worse. I don't want to be a downer... But reading your note gave me memories into the times (just earlier this year) when she used to consistently smile after I told her that I'm her daughter. So thank you for sharing. (and I'm crying now too)
It's incredibly hard. My dad, 53 when he died, called me his nurse's name all the time. Although our names were sort of alike, it was difficult for me to see him decline and not know my name anymore. I tried seeing the humour in it and tried laughing it off. Sometimes it helped, most of the times it didn't. 
My advice: just have patience with him and try to correct him in a positive way. When you keep correcting him in an agressive way, it makes it so much harder for the both of you
Yeah it’s more of when I’m away from him that I find pain. Whenever I’m around him, I give him all the patience in the world and just have a bright smile on my face, as soon as I leave the room I just can’t help but crack a tear. No matter what, I’ll do everything in my power to make sure he is happy and comfortable when I’m around. Just sucks that even just last year me and him would talk about stories from the golden days
Oh man OP, this is hard place to be in. Try asking him what makes his son so great. Just remember he's talking about you. He MUST be so immensely proud of you to talk about you in this way to someone he doesn't think he knows. Just take pride in that. He loves you so much. 

I am so sorry OP. It's a rough haul. I had to hold back tears on Mother's Day when my mom asked me where my mother was celebrating Mother's Day. It just sucks. 

Many hugs to you OP. Just remember, he would be so proud to see you taking such good care of him if he realized it's you. He must be right, he raised such a good son.
When this was happening to me, i took it as positive like he was trying to reassure himself or me that he did a good job and was proud of me while he maybe somehow knew he was on his way out. Its sad but could sort of be felt as reassuring? Sorry if not helpful. Its a cruelly long goodbye.
I'm going through the same thing with my mom right now. It's like she has completely had her mind erased of the past 31 years that we have spent together in the past two months. I especially hate when she asks things like ""where's your mother?"" or when she asks me if I know who her brothers are, or when she'll describe them to me as if I've never met them. She really thinks I'm just a ""nice girl"" (she described me as such while on a call with her brother last week) that lives with her. Or she'll look at pictures I have up of our family and note that she's in the pictures, but she can't put it together that I'm also in the pictures. Sometimes, she also thinks I'm her mom. It's beyond heartbreaking.
My dad just passed a few weeks ago. It really is the worst feeling when they dont recognize you anymore. What got me by as disease got worse was little glimpses of the guy he was. He would perk up whenever we would play Elvis or Johnny cash.  That would make me happy. What I did a lot was when I would visit right away I would say Hi Dad!! He would always get a big smile on his face even thought I knew he didn’t really know who I was most of the time. Cherish these times with your dad.  I know my dad is in a better place, but I really miss him and his smile.
So sorry to hear this! My wife has the exact same problem with her mom...she has no idea who anyone is and needs to be reminded. 

It's crushing and awful to say the least.

I keep telling my wife to focus on the moments when her mom is happy, even if its a small thing...good food, laughing, anything positive. 

Stay active in reading posts from other caregivers, it will help you feel less isolated. Reach out and talk to people in the same situation, it's still painful, but it's always better when you don't feel alone. Strength and peace be with you, my friend.
I’m in the same spot w my mom. But I try to just play along and “interview” her about her amazing daughter. 
She remembers me and has fond memories of me. She’s just not recognizing the person in front of her, and that’s just a part of the disease.
This is a bittersweet feeling. These moments are beautiful but it’s so hard! My dad have been saying the most beautiful things about how much he’s proud of me and more. I can’t imagine how hard is for you but I see that you can see the beauty on these moments. 
It’s how I feel about this sub, there’s so much stories that I see myself and makes me cry but at the same time I feel so happy to get closer of these Humans stories and how we still have so much love to give.
My grandfather died in late 2020 from dementia and prior to that I saw my mum and grandmother interact with him. My advice to you in your predicament would be - focus on the moments when he remembers. Cherish his smiles. If you have family photos, keep them close by and talk about them. Tell him how much you love him. And let yourself cry sometimes, too.
I guess we're all crying now.

It is so sad when all the memories are gone.  Remember that YOU have them to keep close to your heart.

It's all we can do.

and keep loving our parents and be there now when they need us most.
I understand.  I have to tell my dad I'm his daughter all the time.  This horrific disease is heartbreaking.",2021-10-27 10:03:55,ClashGod32,qgxf6v

Alzheimers,Is Healthcare POA all that's needed to put a person (who doesn't think they need it) into a Memory Unit?,"I've tried searching on this in this sub, but may not be using the correct terms to find it. I know I'll need to consult with an attorney, too, but just wondering if Healthcare POA is generally the only thing needed to put a family member into a Memory Unit in a nursing home.","I have found that it depends on the facility. Legally if you have DPOA (and a doctor or two have agreed that the person living with dementia can no longer make decisions) you should be able to make this decision.

Unfortunately, some facilities say it is their facility's policy that they require ""Guardianship"" and not just a DPOA. Guardianship is a longer and more expensive process.

I would suggest checking with the facility that you are thinking to use and ask them their policies and what they would suggest.
You'll probably also need a financial POA.
Yes, if (1) the principal has authorized the POA on the document to admit him or her to a nursing home, and (2) the principal has been evaluated by a treating physician and/or psychologist and deemed incapacitated.  There is typically a form the physician fills out that “activates” a HCPOA, which gives the HC agent the authority to admit the principal to a nursing home.
A facility may accept the HCPOA for initial placement, but if a resident walks out of regular assisted living or becomes aggressive/combative in either assisted living or locked down memory care, legal guardianship may be required to keep them there. It varies by facility and by state.",2021-10-24 18:08:25,NotGoing2EndWell,qf2ftm
Alzheimers,My grandpas (Alzheimer’s) wife passed away and every morning he asks for her,My grandpas wife just recently passed away. He has had Alzheimer’s for a few years and can never remember new information. Every morning when he wakes up it feels like the movie 50 first dates when we have to update him on everything. When he asks for his wife is it healthier for him just to lie and say “she’s out right now will be back later”? I just can’t stand watching him go through the mental pain every morning grieving the death of this wife of 68 years.,"My mother did this, too; she came down with severe dementia during the year after my father died.

Stop telling the truth.  There are two reasons wrapped together:  (1) It causes fresh grief and (2) he won't remember it.   So you're stuck in a Groundhog Day of making him relive the loss every day without its changing his long-term awareness of the death.

Say ""she's out running an errand"" or whatever would make sense.  Then change the subject.   This will hurt less than telling the truth.  My mom once said sadly to me that he was avoiding her, and I assured her that he loved her as much as ever.

Once somebody has severe dementia, for their comfort you have to meet them in the world they live in, not in reality.   The reason for this is that they will not remember being told what reality is.   So ""your car is in the  shop, it should be back soon"" and ""Grandmom [who had been dead 15 years] is out, she should be back soon.""
I would say she is out, visiting a relative or something… changing the excuses until finding the one that makes him less upset, I see no need to make him go through the pain of losing his partner every day
I have learned from my mother you have to let them live in their world. So she asks where my grandmother is and I would say she is at the country club (she died many years ago). 

Trying to get them to face reality is useless and can be abusive if you are causing them anguish. Tell them a lie and deflect the conversation. It is the kindest thing you can do.
My dad still knows his wife has passed but when he forgets I will be telling him she is out. I think that is all you can really do.

Alzheimers,Worried about my 57 years old father,"So he's having hard time with working memory. He works as a sales person at a pastry shop and I noticed he does mistakes in calculation 2/3 of times. Especially when there are multiple orders. I
n the past 2 days, he forgot the car's key inside the car and didn't lock it. Also last week he left the pastry shop without locking it. It was literally open for theives. I took him to a neurologist last year but he assured that nothing is wrong, he asked him easy stuff like name, date and what did he ate..","Keep pushing for assessments and tracking concerning situations. My mom forgot to lock the store she worked at. After the second time, they told her she could retire quietly or they'd have to fire her. We all knew something was wrong.  At that point, doctors were saying she was fine. I knew something was wrong. Two years later, they finally diagnosed Alzheimer's.
Took us a while to get a diagnosis, keep getting assessments a few times a year, you'll get there eventually. They should give him some tasks to do, a sheet similar to [this](https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Alzheimers-test.jpg)
Ask the doctor to perform an MMSE and see if it's possible to get a CT and MRI scan. This will hopefully rule out or confirm tumours or dementia.

My husband was 54 when diagnosed and I have heard of much younger cases.
My mom was diagnosed with this at age 58. In the early phases, it’s hard to detect, especially when the person with it doesn’t want a diagnosis. 

My dad took her to their primary care provider and she didn’t pass the basic testing (drawing a clock and some of the more abstract screening questions).

She was referred to a neurologist specialized in dementia and they did a PET scan, which showed that she was in the early phases. 

I’m so sorry that you’re going through this. I’m not sure if you live in the US, but if you can get it diagnosed, it does provide either workplace protection or disability pay. If you have early onset dementia in the US, you’re eligible for expedited approval for disability pay.

Edit- she showed signs of this at age 53.
How long have these memory changes been going on? If it's a sudden change it could be an infection, so I would suggest asking his primary care to run labs to rule out infection or vitamin deficiency. I would also recommend asking for a referral to a neurologist who speicializes in memory care who can do cognitive screening and order MRI or CT to see if there are any structural changes.",2021-10-24 05:15:37,ezio313,qeomwn

Alzheimers,Sharp Decline in the Last Two Weeks. Long Rant Warning.,"Hello,

I've been lurking here for years and finally feel the need to rant for a little while. My mother was diagnosed 11 years ago at age 60.  Overall, up to the end of last year it's been a very slow decline, which I understand is somewhat rare. Usually every six months or a year there was maybe a 1 point drop in the cognition test provided by her doctor. I was able to go to work and she could function at home (she proactively gave up on driving pretty early on, and finances were monitored for her) while being checked on throughout the day. Thankfully due to this sub I could read your stories and mentally prepare myself for what's to come - as much as possible anyway. I am very grateful to those who post their experiences on here. I'd like to do the same for future subscribers.

&#x200B;

In the last year we've seen a significant decrease in cognitive ability. Her last test a few months ago resulted in a 6 point drop which really surprised me. She's now struggling for words and thoughts and will need to have someone present with her pretty much at all times. Thankfully so far bathroom and hygiene practices can still be done without supervision, but I know it's only a matter of time. She can dress herself but will do things like mismatch earrings. I try not to correct small things like that as it will only agitate her.  Irritability and frustration are at an all time high. She has the desire to do things around the house but gets so mad when she can't functionally perform a task. Any attempt to help causes more confusion and thus more frustration (now directed my way). I've tried multiple approaches to helping and now think it's just a no-win scenario. My best solution at this point is to just be as proactive as possible in house chores to avoid the situation completely. 

&#x200B;

The last two weeks though have been especially rough. I keep saying it would be so fascinating in how the mind works with this disease if it wasn't so damn tragic. There was a benign event that led to some significant chain reactions in thought patterns that no one could have predicted. It goes like this: Our neighbors cut down a tree in their yard. No big deal, right? Well, seeing workers outside in *their* yard made her believe they were in *our* yard cutting down *our* tree. She would frequently go outside in the backyard to check on her tree. In a day or two the thought process morphed into her believing the old neighbors moved out (they didn't) and new ones moved in that wanted to cut down the fence and take over our yard. I explain that is not the case but it's useless. A few more days go by and the fixation on the ""new neighbors"" morphs into her wanting to say hi to them. At least it's not negative paranoid thoughts anymore. Now, after a few days of wanting to meet the ""new neighbors"", she is under the impression that it is us that recently moved in. I keep getting questions like ""Do we live in a town?"" and ""I'd really like to see the schools and what downtown looks like"" in a city she has lived in for 30 years. There's been casual mentions of wanting to go walking outside to look around, which is very concerning. Is it time for child proof locks? Probably. 

&#x200B;

I suppose this stage was inevitable. I just find it so interesting that we got here from a goddamn tree. It's almost funny. Now when she looks around at a house she no longer recognizes as hers, it brings thoughts of insecurity and more confusion. This disease took most of her personality a long time ago. Now it's taking her sense of security and comfortability in her own home. And again, this has been overall such a slow decline over 11 years. Now we are hitting warp speed. I quit my job a few months ago to stay home. I don't believe she would respond well to caregivers that she doesn't know. 

&#x200B;

And this is terrible - but I just want it over with. I sincerely don't want to be insensitive to those who lost/are losing their loved ones quickly. My heart goes out to you and I apologize if I come across as uncaring. I can't begin to comprehend your struggles when I read about them here. But I can't help but be envious to some degree. This has been so prolonged. I just want to rip the band-aid off and get it over with. In my mind, the person who was my mother died a long time ago. I've already grieved her death and made peace with it. However she was replaced with this deteriorating broken shell who is clearly suffering, but can't be fixed. It's a mind-fuck. Literally. And the guilt! I feel guilty for even writing this. That is SO weird. I feel guilty for having these thoughts. I feel guilty for making it about me and not the person with the actual disease. It's crazy. And it's no wonder care-giver depression is a thing. I wish I understood that early on because it combined with the general mental health crisis from the world today is really taking a toll.  

&#x200B;

So, with all that, thank you if you are still reading. I apologize for rambling. I again want to say that I am grateful to those who post their experiences on this sub. I really appreciate the stories that allow for much needed perspective on the timeline/milestones of this disease and all of the advice on how to cope along with it. I wish you and your loved ones all the best.","I relate to this so much! I understand where you're coming from! I tell my hubby all the time that I miss my mom. She's alive but she's already gone.
Sometimes a sharp decline is the result of a UTI.

I had to install double keyed deadbolts so my wife would not wander.
I found comfort in reading this. You should be really proud of the work you're doing - we all should be. Unsung heroes, in my opinion.
Another proactive item: Please consider getting a waterproof mattress cover(s). 

My SO started showing signs just three years ago. It seems that her deterioration is moving faster than your mom's. I lost my job in 2018, and realized the problem that summer, so I have been her caregiver since then. She walks with me when I walk the dog, but doesn't show any desire to wander.
Thank you for this post. This exactly how I feel.
I appreciate your story. While my mom is not yet to this point, she is def trending in that direction and I already can relate with your feelings on having felt like I have already lost her in a way. It's an awful feeling. I want to continue to spend time with her and make new memories but I know that for her the memories won't even stick. I feel like my chance for this is already gone.
I feel exactly the same way about my dad.  Please don't feel crazy or guilty.  It is absolutely a mind fuck.  I am new-ish to Reddit, but if you ever want to talk, there does seem to be a chat option.  Meanwhile, I wish you well.
>And this is terrible - but I just want it over with.

I have spent time talking to therapists and social workers at my mom's memory care clinic about that very thought. What I've learned is actually it's a ""loving thought"" to not want to watch your parent suffering longer than is necessary.

I'm into year 13 of watching my mom deal with this freaking disease. Like your mom, she was in her 60s when diagnosed. It's been such a slow process, and each step of the way, she's been terrified. She had the same neighbor fear, claiming that the neighbors across the street that moved in were trying to get into her home to shoot her every night. We ended up moving her into assisted living when she no longer recognized her house when we'd drive back from appointments. The first place was a hot mess of nurses and aides who always seemed to ""miss"" the door alarms going off. The second place was fantastic and my mom was actually happier than I'd seen her for a couple of years. Then another decline hit and the rage and anger kicked in. Once she broke her wrist attacking another resident for ""stealing her newspaper"" (not hers), the decline has been faster. 

I just had an update with her team of doctors and nurses where she is now. She's off all medications now as she's no longer getting out of bed, she can't stand on her own, and she doesn't want to eat some days. She also no longer talks. I assume this is the final stretch and I only hope it goes faster than the rest of the 13 years have gone.
You don’t need to feel guilty about your story. You’re doing everything right to make your mom’s life better. It’s your mom, you love her and you just want all the best for her. 
Thank you so much for your story.",2021-10-22 16:42:09,Lonestar1911,qdpt17
Alzheimers,Options for In-Home Care (Costs?) or Other Senior Living Facility Alternatives?,"Hi everyone; I'm new here, so forgive me if I'm overlooking posts on this topic. My grandma is living in a senior living facility that I find to be garbage. She is getting neglected, being served terrible food, everyone who works there keeps getting annoyed at her for wandering despite telling us they needed to charge more to move her to a ""memory care unit"" (in other words, a smaller room that is now shared with someone worse off where she can't really watch TV and is barely being monitored, despite the higher price tag). There is no special memory care being provided. She has now had multiple falls. I believe staff is stealing some of the items we send. No one can tell us what's happening or why she is falling. Supposedly they have cameras everywhere but the rooms (okay? So what goes on in the rooms if staff are abusive?), but every time she falls or someone hurts her, they ""don't have cameras in that area"". Just pure B.S. and she deserves better than this. I am trying to figure out ways to get money coming in so I can try to figure out a better situation (her money for this facility is running out quickly), but I have health issues that make a lot of jobs very difficult. I guess I'm wondering a few things:  


\-What is the typical cost (in California) for live-in care? I wonder if it might be cheaper to rent a small house or apartment and hire someone, but it could be more? I mean, her current facility's costs are exorbitant, but I don't know if it would be cheaper to hire someone and pay rent for a little place instead.  
\-How do you find a really wonderful caregiver? How do you make sure they treat your loved one well? Cameras?  
\-Does anyone find that there are people who would be happy with some kind of arrangement where they get free rent (or low rent) in exchange for providing care services, or something like that?   
\-Her house is in shambles. I'd like to find a way to fix and rebuild it; and I'm looking into starting my own building/design firm or trying to get investors to build some new, unique kind of senior care facility that's really nurturing and innovative, but I don't know what I'll be able to pull off. It obviously costs money for all of these options.   
\-I cannot find a facility that seems good for less than what she pays for this current one, which is crazy. Maybe I'm not looking in the right spot but hers is over $5k a month. I would think that we would be able to find a solution for less than that, one where she is happy and well-cared-for, where people actually love her instead of neglecting and snapping at her. Our family is just at a loss and her money is running out fast. We don't want to sell her house; it's been in our family for a long time and we love it. I would love to be able to fix it someday and bring my future children there; but it might take me a few years to be able to buy it. Right now, my older relatives feel like they might have to just sell it. We don't know how to look for other places to move her to. My doctor just started this amazing place, but it's $12k a month...Impossible right now. Where can I look for better facilities that don't cost so much? How do we know they're reputable beyond Yelp? Any ideas?  


I know this is long, so thank you for reading. I would be so grateful for any help, resources, ideas or a direction to look in. I guess I will ask the Alzheimer's Association, too. I hope you all stay well and safe. Thank you!","There was an article last week in the Mercury News (California Bay area) in which one woman who had home care said it costs her $30/hour. It should be less outside of the Bay area.

Finding a good facility is difficult. If your grandma has a social worker, ask them what they've heard about memory places in your area. Then visit these places, and try to talk to the family members of the residents. Falls are, unfortunately, always an issue; for some seniors with dementia, the only way to prevent falls is hiring a 24/7 private caregiver, and that gets expensive quickly.

You have my sympathy for your situation; best of luck to you.
I'm not in California, but in Vermont, home care aides average around $15 an hour. Even if we were able to afford it in her home, we were looking at almost $11,000 a month for in-home care and that's if we'd found private and cheap. Plus, private you are responsible for employment taxes and insurance.

My mom needed 24/7 care for wandering. Her money was tied up in the home, so selling was the only option we had. All of us are still working, and we were doing what the doctors said with spending as much time at her house as possible and watching her on cameras the rest of the time. I'd work from my mom's house all day, my brother would come in after work, get her dinner and wait until she went to bed, and then he'd leave. The day I returned with her from an appointment and she started crying saying this wasn't her house, where was I taking her, it was time to get her out of there.

The first place we moved her to said they were set up for Alzheimer's patients. She wandered away twice. They asked us to move her out the second time as it was 20 F and she was outside in pajamas for who knows how long. The second place was fantastic. They were $7,500 a month, but they worked with us and dropped the rate to $6,500. She was able to live there for three years before she was out of money and had to go on Medicaid. The third place had my mom for a week before they claimed they were untrained for aggression and anger. They left her in the ER without telling me. She's now out of state in a place that costs $15,000 a day (Meant Month!) , but she's in great hands and they've also been fantastic with her.
My family looked into in-home care first and the most challenging part is finding ""awake"" care because my dad is a wanderer. ""Awake"" care means the caregiver will be up through the night. A normal caregiver can only be woken 2 times a night (from the agencies I spoke to). Even without ""awake"" care, the cost was just insane; \~$11,000-12,000/month. We had to do memory care even though it's less desirable.

Alzheimers,Is it Alzheimer’s?,"Hello, I have been taking care of my grandmother for quite some time now. She has suffered from depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and recently broke her hip and leg in a fall last year. 

Recently, in August, she began to complain of hearing voices/conversations about her, hearing people knocking on her bedroom wall from the exterior of the house, invasive thoughts about homosexuality and pedophilia, and extreme, extreme anger. She’s very conspiratorial and secretive.

Initially, I was told that she was suffering from Opioid Induced Delusions; she has been in high doses of morphine, gabbapentin, trazodone, along with sertraline, levothyroxine, and lisinopril. 

I began to taper her down from all of these per her doctors orders; she was taking 4 morphine 15mg tabs per day, and 5 gabbapentin (unk mg) per day. I have successfully tapered her down to 1 15mg morphine per day at night, and 2 100mg gabbapentin per day. But I haven’t seen any improvement, in fact things have gotten worse.

I am starting to become worried; she has so many ailments that I don’t know where to start. She is 72 and prone to UTI’s due to catheter use, and I have read that can cause similar issues. She also has issue with liver function due to high amounts of OTC Tylenol in the past because the morphine wasn’t working, and I have read that can cause an issue as well.

Now, I was told my a friend who works in asssisted living that she believes it may be Alzheimer’s; all of the early symptoms seem to be there, except for the forgetfulness (she knows how to do stuff, but she will forget words or how to use her tv remote, or she will forget what you just told her, like she asks what’s for dinner 3-4 times).

I was hoping that maybe I could get some insight from those who have dealt with this first hand, does what I described fit any of the criteria? Any help is appreciated.","There are lots of different forms of dementia and this could be any number of them, or none of them and maybe just a side effect of the opioids, as the doctors said. The best thing to do is to speak to a doctor about it to have her formally assessed. Tell them everything and mention any changes you've noticed in her behaviour. 

I don't know too much about coming off opioids so I couldn't even take a guess as to how long it might take for any associated issues to wear off, but I'd imagine it may take some time if she's been on them for a while.
With all of her issues and medications it's hard to know for sure. UTIs definitely can induce delirium in the elderly. 

Its possible maybe she's having some withdrawal from the opiates as well.
You definitely need a doctor's opinion on this. Those symptoms overlap several different issues. Dementia, UTIs, drug withdrawals, mental illness... Have you talked to her doctor since starting the tapering? It seems unusual to also taper off the mental health drugs without another plan for managing those symptoms.",2021-10-22 06:56:57,Traditional_Sea6090,qdeea4
Alzheimers,Short Film - An Alzheimer’s Story,,,2021-10-21 14:50:21,Noelle93A,qcymch
Alzheimers,"This sub scared the s*** out of me yesterday, but I'm glad I found it","No idea if any of this will make sense, I'm just putting words down and hopefully it means something. Maybe it just feels good to talk about it.

My wonderful, loving, charismatic, brilliant father has been on the decline over the last few years and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's earlier this year. It wasn't a surprise to anyone, but it hurt to hear out loud none the less.

He's confused, unable to fully track conversations, and agitated by things that break his routines, but he's still my dad right now. He still knows me and loves me and lights up when I walk through the front door just like he always has. The dad I knew my whole life is deteriorating but for now it's still feels... small, I guess? minor? It still feels like if he could just stop declining he could live a happy life with his family. His condition impacts his day to day, but it hasn't had a major impact on our relationship yet. 

I'm so proud of him for how gracefully he's dealt with this so far. I know he feels shame, embarrassment, frustration, and pain with his diagnosis and what he's losing, but he has stayed so positive and has been so vulnerable in describing the way things are making him feel. His eyes well up with tears when we talk about the future. It's heartbreaking. He knows he won't be around for all of it. 

I'm trying really hard to stay positive too. I'm so grateful that I was able to move back to my home town and that I get to spend so much time with him. I think about people who's parents died or will die unexpectedly - a car crash, covid, cancer - and feel so lucky that I've been given enough of a warning that I get to cherish him for a while more. I give him longer, tighter, and more frequent hugs than I ever have before. I'm not sure if he notices. I hope he doesn't because I know it would make him sad to think about why. 

Yesterday it occurred to me that this sub probably existed and I went down a several hour rabbit hole of reading through hundreds of posts here. I just read and read and read and couldn't look away. I cried a lot too. I think it made me face the reality of what my family and I have ahead of us. I'm at the tip of a painful iceberg and reading the posts here took from me any hope of downplaying how massive the iceberg really is. 

I'm really fucking scared. I'm scared of how hard this will become. I'm scared of how much pain my dad will go through. I'm scared that my mom will sacrifice her physical and mental health taking care of him. I'm scared it will be too heartbreaking for her to watch her life partner, her best friend, her lover, her first line of support, her biggest cheer leader, her everything, slowly slip away leaving a shell of a person for us to care for. I'm scared it will be too heartbreaking for me. I'm scared that by the time he dies, I'll have watched him suffer for so long that I feel relief more than anything else. 

All of that said, I can't explain how encouraging it is to see everyone here supporting each other the way you all do. This sub scared the shit out of me, but I'm so glad I've found it because I know I'll have a community of people I can talk to, ask questions to, support, and be supported as each of our own personal tragedies unfold. 

Thanks for reading :)","Thinking of you my friend. I hate to say it and obviously you’ve already read it - but it’s just something that gets harder and harder to deal with. Having a support system is incredibly important and I think this sub has been great for me personally.
i feel that i can relate my situation and emotional responses to your story; and after a tough day, reading this helped me find a little peace i needed.

you being there for your father is very special, and looking back down the road you’ll always be glad that you had this time, and that you were there. 

much love to you bailey bone
If you can take him out to a movie or music he will like or just take him out for ice cream. Give your Mom a break every now and then. Read The Thirty Six Hour Day.
Go into this with the knowledge that others have been there before you and done all the hard work.  


That you can indeed get through this with your father and mother (you'll need each others support)  This is entirely do-able and you can come out of this stronger and a much better person than when you went in.    


It's hard and you will hear about that, but there's also great little points of light along the way.  
Like the time I put my father to bed and he started telling me about all the things he sees me doing and thanking me.   It was a very sincere moment and came from someone that was truly thankful in a way he was never, ever before in my entire life.  
Also when he comforted me when I was scared of the future and the kindness in his eyes as reached out he told me *"" it was going to be alright.""*  
(as if I was his little kid again)

You can get though this together and and I intend to see it though all the way to the end with my dad right by his side.
It's not an easy disease, and some have an easier time of it than others. I have a family friend whose husband lost his memory, but he never went through the rage, delusions, or agitation my mom went through. He never cried to his wife to help him find a way to kill himself (I dealt with that for years). He never wandered off or shoved his wife into a wall (My mom wandered and pushed me out of the way and into walls too often to count.)

Despite this, there are also the bright spots. My mom is in a wheelchair now. She no longer can stand up. She doesn't talk anymore either. Yet, when I went and visited her a week ago, she lit up. I got the biggest smile. My brother and I started picking on each other, and she called us ""Brats."" It was the first word she's said in weeks, and it made my day. 

You just have to find and cling to those bright moments.
I’m you.   Only it’s my dad that is taking care of my mom.  You articulate how I feel in a way I’m unable to.  Love my mom.  Sad for my dad having to care for her during a decline that he can’t control.  He’s an engineer and has always been able to build things/fix problems, and this one he can’t.  I’m watching my Dad feel defeated and my mom on a decline that I’ve denied for a couple years.  My mom still knows and loves me but I know that I need to prepare for when that’s not the case.  My heart aches for you.  And my heart aches for me.  And for my mom.  And my dad. Thankful to have found this Reddit sub
There is some research that supports the Bredesen Protocol, but it needs more studies. At the very least, some of the ideas might help your Dad feel calmer or healthier. It could be worth considering? My doctor just started a senior living facility based on its principles and they claim no one has gotten worse and everybody has improved, but I'm not sure how true that is. Just an idea. I wish you both the best. <3
It's a blessing and a curse to have this kind of warning. Cherishing the time with him is very important and trust me later on the memory of those hugs will mean a lot. I would make sure to take lots of pictures and videos of not only your dad and mom but all of you together. It will be nice for you to have and to give to him to look at as well. 

One thing that I have relied on heavily throughout helping my Nana is humor. Somedays you are gonna get frustrated and upset but sometimes taking a step back and laughing at the silly stuff helps. Also take time now to take note of all of the music, TV shows, and movies he likes and has liked since he was young. If he has friends in the area let them know so they can visit if they want. 

There are so many great resources out there, including this sub. But most important of all is to take care of yourself too whatever that looks like. I wish you many good days ahead.",2021-10-21 15:40:55,Baileybone,qczoy3
Alzheimers,Private wedding with mom- advice needed please!,"We had our wedding in June, but mom can’t fly/be around too many people because of the disease. So we’re having a private ceremony just the 3 of us! Mom used to love getting dressed to the nines, so I’ll make that happen, but any suggestions for how to make the ceremony memorable? Almost thinking to make it “her” centric and have amazing pictures and good memories with her (I’ve already had my big day!). Thoughts? We’re going to dinner afterwards at a nice restaurant","I don't have any input as my wedding experience is zero  but this is wonderful and so thoughtful of you.
Does she still handle travel at all ok? Like maybe just a drive to say a nearby botanical garden or something? Like scenery with a lot of pretty flowers. If she wanders or is a fussy traveller then nevermind about that.. But maybe could do a lot of indoor flowers instead? Or backyard? 

It should be something where its easy for you all to be happy. I think she'll need you to be happy about it too, to enjoy it.
Love this! I know she will appreciate it somewhere in her brain, and you’ll be thankful you went to such trouble.
a really nice meal she would love, a beautiful (but small) cake, and maybe even hire a portrait photographer for an hour or two? i think the photographer would be worth it to get photos of such a nice day with your mom while shes still around :) maybe some nice big flower centerpiece?
You and your husband should get dressed up too, in your wedding dress and a tux if possible.  Have a bouquet, and pin a corsage on her.  That will make her feel special.  Oh, and definitely have a small cake.

It's really thoughtful of you to do this!  Great idea.
Music can be a connection for her- could you play some ceremony music either from her wedding or in line with what she’d feel is wedding music, even if your ceremony was more modern?
I'm late to your thread. Consider getting your mom a corsage, either pinned or a wrist corsage. Those are (used to be?) popular for mothers-of-the-bride.

Your idea of doing this is lovely.
This is so beautiful! I wish you all the best for your wedding and your mom too",2021-10-21 13:14:46,Buddles12,qcwlpy
Alzheimers,How do you handle conversations about people that are no longer living with your loved one?,"My mom (64) is now entering the territory of asking about people who have been dead for years as if she's wondering what they're up to. Last week, it was her uncle (her mom's brother) who has been gone since 2008, and today, it's her mom, who has been gone since 2004.

I'm terrible at the lying to try to redirect, and obviously telling her they've passed away years ago is an emotional roller coaster and not easy either. Also, the lying to redirect makes me uncomfortable, because what happens when she says ""can I see/talk to them?"" I know she may just forget after we've changed topics, but she still has some slight short term memory, and the way some of these conversations are repeating, it wouldn't surprise me to be asked tomorrow ""hey when can I talk to my mom like you said I could,"" or some variation of that.

If you've read my other posts, you know I'm struggling in general with the care of my mom and coping with her Alzheimer's in general. We've been at the point for two months now, where she doesn't realize that I'm her daughter, and she is constantly asking me what my name is. Last night, she told me she wanted to ""go back to dad's"" because she wasn't having ""any fun here."" Here is our home, where she's lived with me for nearly 9 months, and there hasn't been dad to go back to since 1977. It really feels like she's in early-middle adolescence with the way she'll say or ask for things. The going back to dad's comment makes me feel like her parents sent her to stay with me for the summer or something and she's homesick. Today, that kind of echoed after she asked about her mom and said ""they told me the whole reason I was going to come here was to have fun, but I'm not having any fun.""

She knows obviously who her mom is, but ask her who I am, she'll say I'm her mom. The wires are crossed so badly, and it's both sudden and unexpected, while still being expected. The progression she is riding through is unreal. The way she's just so nonchalant about everything scares me and makes me so sad. I know it's all real, but it still feels so unreal. Like I'm waiting for someone to jump out and say ""gotcha!"" I'm just having such a difficult time coping. Any advice is always appreciated.

Oh, one more unrelated thing, her toileting accidents are becoming more and more frequent, but the last two times now, she has been so adamant that she didn't do it as if someone else peed all over the bed and the floor, or that someone else pooped in her pants. I really just have to pretend like it doesn't matter and go along with it, don't I? I know there's really no point in arguing, it's just such a struggle for me to let go.","I was my grandmas caretaker for awhile. She thought my mom was her mother and was always insisting she needed to go start dinner for my grandpa who had died 25 years ago. The worst for me was she became very hostile towards me because she thought I was a stranger and would be very abusive when I had to help her change her diapers or brush her teeth. 

It was honestly the most challenging thing I’ve ever done. It helped to create some mental space between my grandmother who I knew and knew me and the version of her at the end that I was caring for. I’d kind of chat with her like I was the stranger she thought I was and tell her stories about her family which she enjoyed but I never really said it like I was her family because that disoriented her and made her uncomfortable. When my grandma would try to “go home” I’d just take her out for a walk and then we’d go back in the house after a bit. Or if she became combative I’d just walk out of the room for a minute and then come back in and address her as if I was someone new and it usually helped. “Hey, heard you were having a hard time with that other lady ? Need some help with xyz? “ Sometimes I could bribe her into a better mood with popsicles or sitting outside. Sometimes, all you can do is put her in safe environment and let her fret. 

I hope you have support of your own. Find time for yourself.
My mum went through a very similar phase at the start of this year before we moved her into a care home. The kindest and easiest thing that I could do was to lie. If she asked where her mum was (died in 2005), I'd say she'd just popped out for a while and would be back later. I made the mistake of telling her the truth the first time this happened, and she got so upset as if she was reliving it over again (which to her, she was). That made me realise that I couldn't do that again. 

I know lying feels wrong but honestly it's the kindest thing you can do. There's no point in getting them to keep experiencing the pain of finding out their loved ones are dead. If you think she may remember in a short while, try and tailor the lie to give you more time. Instead of phoning them later, phone them tomorrow.

If she's asking for her parents, she's maybe feeling unsafe and this is how she's expressing it. If you can, try and find out if there's perhaps anything that might be causing this but there may very well not be anything. If she's quite adamant that she wants to leave, it might be worth lying and saying that she's going back to them tomorrow? By the time tomorrow comes, she'll have forgotten (certainly my mum did, the stage she was at).

I just wanted to add, I hope you're doing ok and finding some time to look after yourself. I know how heartbreaking and aggravating this stage of the illness can be.
She's not living in our reality. You enter her world (go back in time, join her timeline, use your imagination). Ask yourself why you feel uncomfortable when it's the best thing for her and not about you. Think of it as a mental puzzle, not right or wrong. 

How can I best care for my loved one? What does [edit] she need in this moment? Briefly lie and distract. She cannot enter your world anymore at a certain point of dementia, so you have to enter hers. 

Let her tell you what that looks like. It means removing our ego and sacrificing our own comfort. 

All the best!

Edited to add: my mom thinks I'm her sister now (usually) so I'm glad she finds comfort in my presence and feels a connection to me because it makes her happy.",2021-10-20 21:00:18,shady-pines-ma,qcfprr

Alzheimers,Dad refuses to get vaccines because he thinks he doesn't have insurance,"I'm not sure how to convince my dad to get the flu shot and COVID booster. He refuses to go because he thinks he doesn't have insurance. I just need some advice to understand my dad's thought process so I can counter it.

I've tried explaining that every month he gets medicine from the pharmacy and it's covered by insurance. The nurse that comes every week is covered by insurance. He thinks that's something else covered by the state. At one point he understood that he has insurance so the medicine and nurse are covered, but thought his insurance just got canceled a few days ago...so he can't get the vaccine now.

I've also tried saying that we can pay for it because the flu shot is like $25 and the COVID booster is free. He thinks I'm lying about the cost. I've tried showing him the cost online, but he can't really process what he reads. Sometimes it takes him days to understand a few sentences.

I said he hasn't paid for anything in years, so I'm not sure why he thinks he would even pay for it. We handle all the bills. Then he goes off onto how nothing has ever been paid and the government is going to come and seize the house. I've said that we pay all the bills. If we didn't then they would shut it off. He cannot process that. He just knows I'm wrong.

I've also said that if he doesn't have insurance then it would be cheaper to just get the vaccines because the hospital bill would be very high. He just ignores that and goes back to ""I don't have insurance so I can't get a vaccine.""

I just don't know what to say to convince him.","Just take him to do it. Tell him he’s already paid, or that it’s free. Sometimes lies are kind and helpful.
I love you. You are safe. Time to take your medicine.

I don't explain, they don't understand. Find a gentle way to distract them into what needs to be done. 

Be easy on yourself. You're a good human.
With my mom and a haircut, I faked a ""Free"" coupon. She used coupons all of the time when shopping, so she loved having that coupon to hand over. I just alerted the staff about the ruse first.
It's possible he's developed a fear of needles and is embarrassed about it. Ask his doctor about premedicating with anxiety meds.

Now we get to the 'helpful fibbing' strategies-

Tell him he needs to be vaccinated for the nurse to be able to safely do her job, so the state is paying for him to be vaccinated.

Forge an insurance card and show it to him.

Have ""the pharmacy"" (helpful friend) call him and tell him his doctor ordered him a shot so it's covered/ that he 'won' a free shot after his most recent shopping trip/ whatever fib you think he might buy

Give him cash, take him to the pharmacy, have him try to pay. Obviously discuss this before hand with your friendly neighborhood pharmacist 

Good luck.
Similar thing happened with my father 3 years ago. He was 86 and still living on his own with regular drop ins from me and a couple of family friends.  Still driving to Whole Foods to get lunch and dinner as his daily outings and though his driving wasn’t great, he had a new car with all the safety features and was driving a route he knew cold. 

Then a pipe broke in the living room.  

Ok. My dad has handled contracts and business and insurance all of his life both personally and professionally so it was no big deal.  Just annoying. Right?

Wrong. 

He somehow got it in his head that Roto Rooter was somehow out to kill him over the unpaid bill. I explained to him repeatedly that we had homeowners insurance and the bill was paid.  I had someone on the phone from the insurance company and Roto Rooter tell him it was covered.  I had an adjuster come out to speak with us to confirm. 

None of it worked over a period of a month. 

He insisted on sending them a check for $5k.  They sent it back uncashed. 

He then begged me to withdraw a couple thousand dollars and drive him to the bus station (not the train station or the airport because they would be watching those) so he could take a bus to California and disappear.  

(I made up a comedic song about the Roto Rooter mobsters as gallows humor in my head to deal with the stress)

I convinced him that before I took him to the bus stop that he should get a check up since it was a long trip. He stayed at my place for a couple of days while I set up doctors’ visits with cognitive testing. I also brought the rest of the family into the situation. 

The doctor explained that there is no way to dispel an illusion and that the mind will endlessly rationalize the delusion. Especially for intelligent people like my father. 

The stress of the moment just caused him to snap (as well as a recent gall bladder surgery). 

The rest is as they say…history. 

Good luck with everything. 

My advice is to not challenge the delusion but work around it/them as best you can.
My county is still doing traveling vaccine appointments for the homebound, is that available in your area? Then you can just tell them the nurse has dropped by.
He he actually afraid of the vaccine?  
In my country (USA) There's been a lot of intentional disinformation being spread by some.  


Depending on their ability to remember things and where they're at, I would consider wrapping the vaccine into something that they would like and see as rational.  
Start talking about a vacation trip somewhere.   
Then if you can, leave some information for them about requiring vaccination.  
So going to (tropical place) we need to get some shots against (disease).  


That sets the stage and it's not about covid or the flu... it's about being able to go somewhere fun.  


after the second covid shot, let him know that the trip got delayed.  


OR wrap it up into a regular doctors visit.  
But stand in line for the covid and flu beforehand... don't tell him just do it.  
He'll see others getting their shots and perhaps follow along.  


\_\_\_\_\_\_

I wanted to get my fathers DNA recored for later use.  
So a 23andMe sample kit was provided, he refused for years.  
finally, one night out of the blue I told him the the doctors needed a sample.  
He did it, no questions asked.  


White lies are perfectly fine and acceptable due to their condition.
My dad kept thinking he didn't have any money for a while. He only could understand cash. 

Maybe just say ""you were right! So I signed you up for insurance and it's all handled now!""
I’ve got gran and myself booked for 3rd covid booster and flu shot booked for Saturday all at the same time in one go. Took a few phone calls, but wow the NHS is fantastic.
just tell him they are free and mandatory???",2021-10-19 22:40:54,crimson_leopard,qbr5mt
Alzheimers,I lost my patience and tried to choke my grandmother with alzheimers.,"I am a mentally ill 34/F and both my uncles and mother have left me the primary care of my grandparents who both have dementia. I cannot do anything without being harassed by my grandmother. Since I'm the only one that is always with them my grandma takes everything out on me. I can't go out of the house, i can't do anything i like, i have to be within her eyesight all day. I am trying to complete my college degree and nothing angers her more than me leaving for class and coming back past 3pm. She screams that she is more important than me obtaining an education. Last night she was being verbally abusive and I tried to choke her. I feel like shit.","It's time to leave. When being a caretaker you have to put your mental health first. If not you can't properly care for your loved one.

It's time to focus on your degree and your mother and uncle can decide if they want to take over care or find memory care. 

We all snap at some point. I had to start anxiety meds to cope. 

It's great you have done so much for them but it's time to move on. You've done more than enough.  And make sure you put your mental health first now! We often neglect ourselves during this process.
Are you in the USA? It sounds like you have hit your wall and shouldn’t be doing this anymore. I would reach out to APS and let them know that it is not safe for her or you to continue to care for her. They should be able to walk you through options. We eventually had to bring our mother to the ER and basically drop her off there. Basically she is the states issue now and we do not have any real say in her medical proceedings. 

Either that or tell your family that that’s your plan - you simply cannot do it anymore. If one of them steps up to the plate great but both you and your grandmother are going to get hurt if you continue.
Also, I take care of them 16 hours a day/7 days a week and get paid $240 a month because the family doesn't want to spend too much money on caregivers.
yes, you should take care of yourself, for your own sake. but dude at least get yourself out of the situation before you snap again, so you don’t end up in jail after accidentally doing anything more serious. the fact that you feel like shit means you don’t want anything more serious to happen. listen to that part of yourself. keep your grandmother safe too by getting yourself away from her presence. i’m mentally ill too, and i once grabbed my mother’s arm forcefully to hold her still after she asked the same question over and over.  it’s the most shameful part of my “care journey” and i think of it a LOT. i needed to detach myself emotionally big time or i would have snapped at some point. i still worry about snapping but i’m much more comfortable with the concept that i’m able to remove myself
from the situation.

if the money is holding you there, find something else to transition to as soon as your current situation changes. please please please find something else.

it totally sounds like your family is just taking advantage of you and your willingness to care and take responsibility. i hope you stand up for yourself and say NO MORE DAMMIT to them. i really really hope you get the practical and emotional help you’re looking for. Caregiving is the toughest thing i’ve ever done.
Thank you to everyone that answered. Your words were very kind. I have taken your advice 
and removed myself from my grandparent's home for both of our safety. I don't know what the family is going to do. Most probably they're going to look for people with financial issues and pay them the bare minimum to take care of my grandparents. God I hate money.
Sweetie you need to get out before something else happens. Call the medics now and get yourself help or drive to the hospital .. Someone else will step in. Just let them know what is going on.
You are burned out and need to be done. Grandma needs to be on medication, her behavior is very common and can be helped with medication.",2021-10-19 17:31:57,,qblik8
Alzheimers,Found a video of my mom before she got sick,"So a few days ago I found a camcorder my parents bought years ago and decided to charge it and see what was on it. It had videos I don’t remember recording, things I remember happening but not remembering they were recorded. Everything was from 8 to 10 years old.

So as I went through them, there was a video I recorded of my mom and it was pointed at her face. I watched it and I started bawling. Hearing her talk, laugh, make facial expressions, move around, and just look like a real living person broke me. I just rewatched a bit and I’m full on crying while trying to type this. She looks and sounds so much different it’s terrifying.

There was another video I took of my brother being silly and he walked into our kitchen and she was in there too. Seeing her opening the refrigerator, walking to the sink to grab wipes from underneath, and speaking doesn’t even seem real. Comparing her from then to now is crushing. 

I’m so fucking pissed this goddamn disease literally killed my mom. She doesn’t even resemble the person she once was and it’s so scary. I miss her even though my memory can only remember how she’s been in recent years. I miss my mom and who she used to be. It’s not fucking fair my mom is now a walking corpse and a shell of who she was. I just want my mom back.","I totally get it.  My mom is in late stage Alzheimer's.  She is sleeping 20 hours out of 24 and barely talks.  I came to realize lately my mom is gone.  The only thing left is a shadow of who she was.   Just about everything that made her her is gone.  

At times, all I can do is sit and cry.
Me too.  It's BOTH my parents.  I've been weeping daily for more than 3 years.
Totally get you - found some voicemails from my mom before the disease had really taken its toll. Probably sat for about 45 minutes on the couch and just cried. It’s just not fair.
“…my memory can only remember how she’s been in recent years.”

I was this way too. I told my sisters that I couldn’t remember my mom before the disease. I get it. But that passes. Eventually the memories of these bad times will fade (or at least lose their desperate emotional resonance) and you will remember her as she truly was. 

Fuck Alzheimer’s.
Yeah, I feel you. My mom was a dynamic, witty, take charge kind of person, tons of fun and tons of laughs. While she's only mid-stage, it feels every day like I've lost her. She isn't motherly anymore. Any concern she has for me is shallow and fleeting. And, yeah, when you mention the loss of facial expression, she's definitely started down that road. So, like with my dad, I'm grieving before she's died. 

I'm sorry. This is the crappiest club in the world to be a member of.
""Make facial expressions"". 

We made our annual visit to the optometrist. She immediately recognized that my SO had Alzheimer's from the lack of facial expressions. She had an assistant take her to the exam room and then ask about her. She wanted to make certain that I understood that my SO had Alzheimer's. Her staff stayed with my SO while I got my check up. My SO doesn't read anymore, and her vision is 20/25, so the optometrist didn't think with the very small change in vision that we should change the prescription of her lenses. I have noticed changes in visual comprehension in my SO as she sees some objects but thinks that the object is something different. Glasses won't change that problem.

Alzheimers,Care giving - Family voices,"Oh. My. Goodness.

I think it's always best to leave family members (who don't want to help) out of the care situation entirety. 

It's not good to ask, or expect anything from them. It only causes hardship.

Summary is that my heart breaks for my wife who has two sisters, one who is very helpful and another who isn't at all...and refuses it. However unhelpful sister likes to make comments about decisions that have been made regarding care giving. 

The family politics and drama is insane. I'm sure I'm not alone in this.","Oh definitely. My aunts are finally realizing how serious it is and stepping up a bit more, but I don't let them have any say in decisions because they didn't step up when I first needed the help. And when they would make comments about how we should do more socialization with him I was like ""you're welcome over whenever you want to take him out!"" Shut them up fast.
You are not alone in this. I can't even get into it because I get too upset but we are going through the exact same thing.
My sister was supported by my mother and father for decades.  
She lived in their home with her two kids and took advantage of them.  
My mother passed away and my fathers Alzheimers has him now living with me for the last 3 years.   


She doesn't call, visit, offer help or anything... completely vanished after taking everything she could from their home and leaving town.  


You're not alone in this.
It's so sad to see family members who don't even care anymore. My Nana has a younger brother who lives on the east coast and we are in the midwest. They had a falling out when I was little and only really talked on birthdays or holidays and as her disease progressed all contact had stopped. My mom (her daughter) had tried to reach out and let him know what's been going on and he just got mad that no one had been checking in on him and his wife. He doesn't care that his sister is in memory care and has beat COVID twice. No matter what the caregivers do it will never be enough for someone on the outside.
I'm taking care of my mom and get so angry by my siblings and my dad doing nothing. One of my sisters is totally off reality and lives in a 100% virtual world, just making excuses to do nothing and live like a fucking weirdo, even when my mother still pays for her living at 23 years old. My 21 years old sister just don't want to take any responsability for it and enjoy her life like she's a teenager, but at least she lives in another place now. My dad has some disease like autism, but my uncles and grandmother just created him as a totally disfunctional human being who don't want to do any task, never got a job, lived with his mother until he found my mother to replace her and give him everything. He's like an 14 years old boy in the body of an 62 years old man, and pass all day in his bedroom watching shit. It's like I replaced the role of my mother in our family when I became her primary caregiver, and right now I'm doing this only for her. But it's a hell to become the ""father"" of my dad and sisters calling them for the minimum responsabilities that they should know by themselves they have. Everything should be three times easier with the cooperation of these assholes, and I will be glad when finally capable of hiring a professional caregiver and run away the most I can from this shitty family.
I am lucky that my brother is verbally supportive of everything I do.  That said, I do it all.  When it comes to caring for our Mom, I am functionally an only child.  

My opinion is if you are not helping, you don't get to be critical.  If you can't say something positive, sit down and shut up.  

I would tell the unhelpful sister that I have enough stress in my life and if she continues I will be disengaging.  As soon as she start in, hang up, walk away, whatever it takes.   

This is hard enough without family making it worse.
Oh I hear you! I am one of four siblings. My 88 year old mother has Vascular Dementia and I ( with my husband) am her caregiver. Two of my siblings have mental illness and live in another state. My other brother lives 15 minutes from her and never calls or comes over. Sometimes the negative feelings I have toward him border on hateful. I try not to have expectations but easier said then done. It’s just incredible the way people she loves so much can utterly and completely disconnect. Hang in there and try hard to do good things for yourself. This is the hardest job we will ever do and we need to take good care of ourselves.
Oh man, my husband is one of 7. Things are infinitely better since MIL moved into memory care in July. His siblings are much more willing to help now that there is very little to do. They do visit her more often now so that’s good.
I feel for you!   I care for my mum - my sister is a nightmare, she's a monster & a scammer.  We all back home living together now, the past few years.  Will do less than zero but always demands that we (I) organise things how she decrees - and she understands near-zero about mum's care needs. 

  I told her until she does the Dementia / Alzheimers .org family carer workshop/course, she has zero say.   (lol, she'd NEVER in a trillion years bother to even look at a leaflet from them)  And then I ignore her & her histrionics.   Absolutely, it's best not to ask her to help with anything, it results in major confusing horrid drama & whatever it was not even done appropriately or sufficiently, maybe even done worse or endangering mums health & safety.   My sister has certain specific mental health conditions - featuring Narcissistic Personality Disorder - so yeh, plenty drama round here sometimes.   

Best of luck, bagpipeforlife!
Three is a tough number. I’m also one of theee sisters. None of us refuse to do anything, but one sister does most by far. The thing is, she made a choice as our mother’s best friend to take it on when there were other options. No matter what we did to help, she wouldn’t release control and made herself sick. We ended up placing our mom after multiple trips to psych hospitals and calls to 911, but this same sister has so much guilt that we have to piece her back together almost daily. It’s painful to see.
Yup that’s very common. My grandma has 4 kids and 3 of the 4 help it as much as they can. The forth has always been distant and he just doesn’t understand how bad my grandma has gotten. He doesn’t understand how to talk to her so when they get off the phone she gets upset because he thinks “oh you’re fine you’re just old” when it comes to any decisions he always voices an opinion that is so unrelated. It’s unfortunate but it happens.",2021-10-18 14:56:47,bagpipeforlife,qatcii
Alzheimers,Great gadget for those still living fairly independently.,"Xplora X5 play smart watch for kids- great for wanderers/walkers who forget their phone. Lots of videos on YouTube 

Edit- the geocaching is all of a sudden working and I am getting notifications when he leaves his safe zones. I did an app update and it has started working today!

My dad has Alzheimer’s but is still able to live alone but we are on the last hurrah of independent living because he has always been an avid walker/hiker and it is the “dangerous” activity that is only a matter of time before he becomes disoriented. Right now he still knows his routes and neighborhood. He has recently started forgetting his phone when he sets off for his walks and I stress when I can’t get him on the phone or track where he is through his phone. We recently got him a smart watch that is geared for kids so it is user friendly enough for him to use but looks like an adult smart watch. From my research you have to be careful when you buy these watches as they don’t work in every country and you have to make sure your cell phone carrier can support it. I am located in British Columbia Canada and I was able to add a line to my Rogers cell phone plan to get a SIM card and phone number for the watch at an additional $50/month on my plan. When I went into the store the Rogers sales associate told me he couldn’t guarantee that it would work perfectly and it might be glitchy. He told me he could only guarantee that an Apple Watch would work perfectly. An Apple Watch is too complicated for my dad and has too many features he doesn’t need and it doesn’t have the ability to geocache “safe zone notifications” like the kids smart watches do. The one we got is called the Xplora X5 play. He wears the watch and I can monitor him through the app on my phone. The watch allows him to send and receive calls, text messages,instant messages, take pictures and it is VERY accurately GPS tracked. I am able to set up “safe zone notifications “ in the map from my map so I get a notification if he leaves his home or if he enters the shopping Center. I find the geocaching isn’t working very well (I am not getting notifications when he leaves the safe zones I have created) but it is new so I might not have set it up properly but according to reviews I’ve read that function hasn’t worked for a few people. It isn’t the biggest deal though because I can always see where he is regardless if I get the notification sent to my phone that he is on the move. The gps is so accurate that if I drill down on the map when he is at home I can see what part of the house he is in. When we were running errands I kept my eye on the accuracy of the gps all day and it was bang on every step. When we were in the mall I could drill down on our location and i could see the name of the store we were standing in front of on the map. It has taken away all my stress that he will forget his phone at home and get disoriented on a walk and I can’t reach him. If he falls- his phone is right on his wrist. I can always call his wrist and track where he is and the routes he has been taking so I can see if anything starts becoming outside of the normal (like he goes off course on a new route I didn’t know about or if he all of a sudden starts going for out of character 2am walks around the block. I’ll see it the next morning when I wake up the first time it happens when I check the tracking history from the night before. So far we are not there yet but when things change they change fast and I want to be ahead of the safety game. If I can get the geocaching notifications to work I’ll know if he does it in real time I will be alerted if he steps out of his home which I cached as a “safe zone”. The geo caching should work and maybe when they release an update it will work for me on my iOS). It is also handy when I am meeting up with him somewhere outside the house- he doesn’t have the stress of trying to describe where he is or give directions to me which is something he obsesses over. It’s one of his “things”

The battery lasts 8 days on standby. This appears to be accurate. With all day constant use the first day we got the watch and played around with it more than it would normally be used it still only used up 30% battery in the first 24 hours. You can see what the battery life of the watch is at through the app which I find handy in case I am not with him I can see if his battery is low and remind him to charge it. A full charge takes about an hour.

I find the calling, texting and gps features work perfectly and the only issue I’m having is with the geocache notifications. However, this watch is android and I have the app that runs the watch on my iPhone. I wouldn’t be surprised if android cell users would get the geocache notifications. But it is working like a peach considering it’s an android and I’m controlling it from iOS- only the geocache notifications are glitchy and that is okay.

Dad always liked Star Trek and he is GETTING A KICK out of holding his watch up to his ear and mouth to talk on the phone. He says he feels like a futuristic Star Trek character. The watch is plain black so it doesn’t look child-like at all like some of them do. The speaker is loud enough that you don’t have to put your hand up to your mouth or ear when you are at home talking on the phone but when we tested it in the mall he had to put the watch right up to his ear and he could hear fine and I could hear him fine on my end. The ringer is quite loud (his hearing is fine) and it also vibrates AND rings when someone is calling so it would be great for people with hearing issues.

This watch would be useful for Alzheimer’s because really the only function they need to be able to do is answer a call on it if someone calls. The gps will always work. Even if they can’t understand how to dial out as long as they know to hit the green phone button to pick up you can be in contact. That’s ALL they really need to do to make this useful. The screen is very basic and user friendly for kids so it is the better option to adult smart watches. Dad is struggling a bit but IS getting MOST of it. All the important parts. He can dial in and out. Hasn’t mastered the voice text messages yet- that’s a new one to him. He has even been sleeping in the watch. I asked him if it bugged him in his sleep and he said not at all. I find comfort in being a dial away on his wrist while he is laying in bed.  I wish Apple would make a smart watch for the elderly. It would be SO useful. I have a list of a few functions I think that would be useful for the elderly that would be different than kids needs. A 2 way radio function where you can hear their surroundings even if they don’t pick up and communicate where they don’t have to press a button on their end? Or a notification if they try to spend over $500 on a banking card that is linked? Can someone please make a call and make this happen?

If phone scammers ever become a problem we will cut off his cell phone and just have him use the watch. The reason for this is that only phone numbers that I put into the contact list on the app can call or receive calls from the watch. It’s a safety feature geared for children but it will be great when he gets to the point he might fall for a telephone scammer. The watch holds 50 contacts. Right now it is important he still has his own phone and he can track his kids whereabouts from the app on his phone still. It is only fair if we can track him he can track us and his phone is part of his independence. He has just never been remembering to bring his phone with him. He will leave it upstairs and go downstairs or outside all day and I sit at work with my stomach turning. This has taken that stress away completely.

Xplora X5 play smart watch for kids/wanderers- works on a Rogers SIM card in Canada.","This is a great idea.
We've gone through so many lost phones I've lost count. Thanks for sharing.
I can see how this could work but this is very dangerous. No Alzheimer's patient should be left alone. This is a nice back up if your loved one likes to randomly head out the door. My dad would often go outside so we put bells on the door to alert us and used things that prevented him from turning the handle. 

An Alzheimer's specialist told me that gps trackers create a false sense of security. Prevention is key. A person with dementia could easily forget and walk into the road and into traffic, wander onto someone's property with a pond or have their watch stolen. 

Then there are the various things that can happen in the home. My dad almost got talked into purchasing a $5000 home security scam. He left water running, stove on, microwaving a metal bowl and cups in the fridge door with a glass overflowing. 

So please don't rely on gps. Only use as a back up.",2021-10-17 20:42:16,Username1223487,qabljy
Alzheimers,Grandmother hiding and hoarding medication,"My grandmother is 88 years old and lives in her own separate house located on our property. She's been diagnosed with alzheimers about 1 year ago and since then she's been rapidly declining. Today she was out with my mother and I got the job to go take a look around her house cause we have the feeling she hasn't been taking her medication (we put her medication in a pill box every day and hand it to her in the morning and she brings us back the empty box in the evening).
She has forgotten to take her medication before and then quickly emptied her pill box out and put the pills in a drawer so that we wouldn't tell her off, so I checked there first and there was 1 pill. I moved some papers aside and there was a whole cup full of what mustve been 30+pills. I was sorta shocked.
I decided to keep looking around and when I checked her pantry my heart sank. I found all kinds of medications tucked away between kitchen towels and food. 3 boxes of aspirin, imodium, codeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracodine, boxes of her blood pressure medication.. I don't know how she got them  cause they're not expired so they can't be that old. 
I left everything the way I found it and I guess we'll just tell her doctor about this. 
It makes me wonder if she can be trusted to live on her own anymore and if maybe it's time for her to go to a nursing home. Moving into our house isn't really an option, this situation is already extremely stressful at times. 
Is this a common thing with alzheimers? How do you make someone take their medicine when they just lie about it? We've tried to make her take it while we're standing there but then she gets offended and says we act as if she's a child.","If she absolutely refuses to take meds in front of you you may have to trick her by lying about what it is or hiding it in her food. Confirming its ok to do this with pharmacist first, like putting it with hot food or crushing it or whatever, or finding different forms of the same med that might be easier to take or hide in their food.

 But because of the volume of hidden meds.. I don't actually think she could be left alone unless someone is willing to supervise her meds taking. 

A thing i found recently is it can make a difference who asks her to take the meds or eat the med spiked foods. Like a grandchild or a sweet relative who they don't associate with having authority. Then they might be less likely to get defensive, and feel more like they are they are being nice to that person, or doing them a favor.
My mom broke one of those expensive timed pill delivery machines because... who knows?  

We just try to get her to take them now in front of us.  But the doctor has said this may be the price of living at home.
I think you have tobe  open and honest and let you know that you know she has not been taking her meds. She has to take them in front of you. Dementia patients will often lie and say they did. You have to watch and be prepared to have her open her mouth to check. Unfortunately, they often try to hide in their cheeks ect. If she knows the consequence is either she goes to a Care home or stays and takes pills she should comply. Once she is on her medications properly, some of her behaviours may settle down. Ultimately, she will need a carehome. Dementia patients usually get very defensive. Be prepared to be tough and have a plan with your Mom. It may take a couple of conversations.

Also the Dr needs to be aware and I hope she has had mini mental exams that prove she can no longer look after herself. Also a personal or advance directive, placing your Mom as her decision maker. Good Luck
This may indeed be a sign that it's time for her to go to assisted living.   Is your grandmother still safe to be around a stove, for instance?  Are you certain that she will remember to turn off things that she turns on?   Can she scald herself by leaving a hot tap on?  One of the many sucky things about Alzheimers is that patients do get too sick to be cared for in any but the most wealthy (in time or money) families.   There is no shame in realizing that your grandmother can no longer be safe in a separate house.

My mother, also, started refusing pills.   We talked to her doctor and determined which of her pills were necessary for her immediate comfort and which were not -- for instance, her  antidepressant versus her weekly Fosamax for bone density.  Some of the drugs she was taking were to ward off long-term problems, which made sense as long as she was willing to take medications.

Right now, I think she's only taking an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic to improve her mood.   Both of those can be ordered in a sprinkled form that can be sprinkled over ice cream/pudding/whatever.
She should not be living alone any more.  She can’t handle everyday tasks and may put herself a n dangerous situations. If you can’t have caregivers with her at all times, then she should be in a home.
Can always lie and say the doctor said if she won't take the pills in front of you that he won't let her live alone anymore. But you're probably right that it isn't long before she needs 24 hour supervision.

Alzheimers,Grandfather was diagnosed. I’m new to this and terrified.,"I’m not sure how far along he is in medical terms. I’m too afraid of upsetting my mother by asking. I’m 20 and in college and rarely have any free time to travel up and see him. I see him maybe once a month. His memory is foggy but he still remembers his loved ones and most important things. I’m worried that his memory is going to slip by before I have the chance to spend enough time with him. I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. I know the worst is only yet to come and I am terrified of that. 

He told me that I should pick up the piano again. I am so exhausted by my degree that it’s hard to do anything outside of it. I need to try for him, though.

I don’t know exactly what I’m here to ask. I just want someone to hear me, I suppose.","Take the time to see him before he forgets you 😔
Can anyone get him an iPad? Or Set one up for him on so you can do a Zoom or FaceTime call with him on a regular basis? I had to place my mom back in May, but FaceTime was a great way for her to stay in touch with her grandkids across the country during the lockdown.

Alzheimers,I think my mom is developing Alzheimers.,"I’m really worried for my mom (55) lately she’s been forgetting more and more regarding simple things. Like if she locked the door, put away food, closed the water faucet. She even forgets when she asks me questions, and will ask me multiple times. I’m really worried that she might be developing Alzheimers. My grandmother also had Alzheimers so I was wondering, is it hereditary? I’m just really worried for her and was wondering if you all could give me some tips to know if she’s developing Alzheimers and how I could aid her. Thank you!","She'll need to see her doctor. If you think she might be resistant to the idea you could always contact her doctor, let them know of your concerns and what you've noticed. The doctor can do a preliminary check at her appointment. 

You are doing a great thing by noticing the little stuff.
Now is the time to get both POA, passwords, car titles and other important documents.
>  My grandmother also had Alzheimers so I was wondering, is it hereditary?

Yes, it can be (strong association) with faulty genes. 
My fathers family is the same and the gene set is on the X chromosome and seems to be dominant for the eventual development of Alzheimers/dementia.

what I would do:

I would start now by changing her diet - [The Mediterranean diet is the best](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/mediterranean-diet) 

there's [lots of articles all reaching the same conclusion](https://www.google.com/search?q=mediterranean+diet+alzheimer+disease+and+vascular+mediation&client=safari&rls=en&ei=iTJqYZXUIKWs0PEPg7CmsAw&oq=mediterranean+diet+alzheimer+disease+and+vascular+mediation&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYATIECAAQDTIGCAAQFhAeMggIABAIEA0QHjIICAAQCBANEB4yCAgAEAgQDRAeMgUIABCGAzIFCAAQhgM6BwgAELEDEAo6BAgAEEM6BwgAELEDEEM6BAgAEApKBQg8EgE4SgQIQRgASgUIQBIBMVD-EFiGL2D1WmgIcAB4AIABeYgBoAOSAQMyLjKYAQCgAQHAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz)

You can also help with making sure shes taking a good round of cognitive acting supplements (this might require some research on your end).  I foudn that my father greatly improved when I started changing his supplements and starting him on a routine of cognitive enhancing vitamins and other easily sourced supplements and activities - exercise (like walking) is super important. 

Then I would get their affairs in order and set up a power of attorney when certain criteria are met.   Do all of this with their knowledge and cooperation, it can take the form of you double checking their bank and paying/management of their finances with them sitting next to you. 
But it will be a HUGE benefit to you both if and when things go downhill. 
She will have confidence in you and that can be HUGE.  My father experienced paranoia over his loss of faculties and while he was fearful of us stealing from him he was also taken seriously advantage of and we have no idea where a huge amount of his savings were lost.   All we know is that he was extracting between 4-10K a week in cash and coming home with nothing to show for it.

By the time we got power of attorney and access to the accounts it was all too late and he didn't have any reliable recollection of where that money went.

So be careful, they need protection from themselves and the nature of the parent child relationship will be flipped on you if they go down into alzheimers.   You have to understand that upfront.

But right now, make sure they have a good trust and their wishes are all well worked out and signed for, that when certain criteria are met that power of attorney is automatically supplied to a designated person or trust (family).
My mom was diagnosed two years ago at age 74. Looking back, she likely developed the disease around age 70(ish). Well she lost her sense of smell back then which I guess we should have been more concerned about but we weren’t. Shortly after started the gradual forgetfulness - mostly short term. She would repeat things, ask the same questions, forget where she placed something but we didn’t start getting really worried until two years ago when she started to struggle more frequently with short term memory. She had actually written something in a new book she bought and told my sister that someone has written in her book. She seemed to not remember writing it or that it was her own handwriting. As kippy236 said above, it’s great that you are aware and looking out for her, and there is no harm in getting preliminary testing done. My mom went through so prelim testing with her PCP and they felt concerned enough to have more in-depth testing done, to include a brain scan that confirmed the amyloid plaques on her brain. It’s a scary disease and there’s no sugarcoating it but I’m thankful my mom was diagnosed earlier than later and was able to start Aricept to hopefully slow the progression. Best of luck to you - keep us posted ❤️
It can be hereditary but if you're grandmother had dementia in her 70s/80s then a hereditary cause would not likely present at 55 years old.   Hereditary dementia at old age is most connected with APOE4 gene.  Genetic causes of early AD are most correlated with genes presinilin 1, presinilin 2, and mutated amyloid precursor protein instead.

Is your mother under a lot of stress? Stress, depression, and anxiety can cause memory troubles that look like dementia starting.  This is way more common than Alzheimer's at 55.

Best thing would be to see a neurologist and get a memory workup.  Prevagen and expensive  ""memory supplements"" are pretty useless so don't spend too much on these.
I’m so sorry. I know how this feels- my mom started showing subtle signs at age 53. By age 55, the whole family was aware.

Make sure that someone attends the appointment with her. There is a denial phase and if it’s early, the family’s perspective is usually the best indicator of it.

My mom was a bit snappy right before she got diagnosed and once we got her on the right meds, her temperament improved. 

It can be hereditary, but it can also be spontaneous. You can possess the genes for it, but it might not activate. We don’t know what activates it, but it does have a genetic tie. 

The best thing you can do to prevent it is to exercise regularly and keep your mind sharp.

Edit: If you’re in the US, an early dementia diagnosis will allow for your mother receive expedited disability approval. A good care team can assist in the paperwork. This should at least provide some income OR job protection
I would look into getting long term care insurance before an official diagnosis.
Hi. Sorry for your concerns, but you are doing right paying attention to all these signals. The sooner you find out, the more you can do.

When I was really worried for my mother last year, I knew the possibility of dementia was serious after doing a simple short therm memory game with three objects in my hands that my mother couldn't recall just after I closed my hands and put them on my back. It was an advise from a doctor that I saw in a video, and it worked to argue with her to investigate the symptoms.

Sending my best wishes to you both!",2021-10-15 18:38:39,a_person841,q8z7y3
Alzheimers,Mother-in-Law won't allow my wife to help.,"Thank you for your help. This is my second post ever. (My post was to post this one in r/legaladvice)

My father-in-law (FIL) was recently diagnosed with brain and lung cancer. It's expected that he will be gone within a few months. The stress of this news has rapidly progressed what we believe to be dementia in his wife (mother-in-law - MIL). Before my FIL's diagnoses, we had been unsuccessfully trying to get my mil to a doctor for proper diagnoses, but she hates ""traditional medicine"" (anti-vax, anti-everything) and refused to go. We were trying firmly, but there didn't seem to be a massive urgency since we were only seeing small hints of dementia and my FIL was healthy and of sound mind.

Since FIL's diagnoses, the stress of everything has *rapidly* accelerated her decline. She has entirely changed in less than 4 weeks and now can't be left alone. My FIL has taken care of his affairs, but everything gets left to MIL. MIL has a paranoid delusion that everyone wants to steal her stuff. She will NOT sign a will, power-of-attorney, or any other end-of-life/post-life documents. And she will NOT go to receive any medical care. It's important to know that she has very few assets to worry about. I make more in a year than she has total. So she's not protecting a fortune. My wife just needs the authority to take care of it all when she's gone. And, the most important part, my wife will most likely have to pay MIL's bills and take care of all other daily affairs after my FIL passes. MIL cannot manage even a few hours on her own at this point.

We have no plans to put her in a home. We have space for her here and people around to help. But if MIL survives for a while, we may have to sell her house because it's an unmanageable hoarder nightmare. She can't live there. FIL kept an area clean and livable, but MIL was too much for him to keep it all nice. Now that he is sick, she has ruined every bit of that house.

My question: Without an official diagnosis, what can my wife do to take over MILs affairs so bills can get paid and the house can get taken care of?","FIL needs a rock solid will putting everything in the hands of someone other than MIL. Talk to an attorney who specializes in family law.
I see someone in legal advise answered.  I’m sure it won’t be easy, but seeking an elder attorney is the way to go.  When my father passed, I had to get guardianship of my mother and grandmother…they had progressed farther than your mil, and the right paperwork wasn’t in place already.
A rapid decline in less than 4 weeks is not really consistent with dementia progression.  Typically that indicates delirium caused by some acute process like a uti, high blood sugar, fracture, etc.  

I'm not saying she does not have dementia but the 3 week steep decline would not be due to Alzheimer's or similar dementia progression.  Severe stress could have an effect as well as you said.

Does she see any doctors at all? even a primary care?  Perhaps you can just fill the primary care physician in on the situation before she sees him/her for a regular yearly checkup and he/she can make some sort of assessment there.",2021-10-15 10:48:03,User_End_2021,q8pzbw

Alzheimers,Dad with Alzheimer's doesn't recognize mom and Threatened her,"My mom (63) is taking care of my father (78) who's Alzheimer's has been   getting worst and worst quickly since he retired and the pandemic started. Lately he has not recognized her much and thinks she is ""another Rose."" He asks her to take him home most days even though he is home so he can go back to his wife Rose. Today my mom said he wouldn't go to bed and was mad that she wouldn't ""take him home."" He told her to make sure she closes her door because he might come and hit her. And that she doesn't know what she has done and that she has created so many problems. 

&#x200B;

My mom doesn't know what to do in these situations. Does anyone have any advice I can give her?","The 'other Rose' situation is down to Capgras syndrome: they believe the person has been replaced by an imposter. Unfortunately there is no arguing with Alzheimers so please don't put yourself through the heartbreak. 

As for the going home you just have to develop strategies to distract/redirect his attention. Some that work for us: 

We are staying here tonight but will go home tomorrow. 

If you can take him on a short drive/walk round the block to go home.

Talking about the home he wants to go to and segue into other topics.

Good luck.
I'm so sorry you and your mom are going through this. Alzheimer's is awful and sadly I have no advice I can give you.

But I'm hopeful that perhaps just one single comment will give your post a little boost so someone who does have some advice can see it.

Give your mom a hug and tell her that she is doing a great job. Also, look in to getting some over night care. I'm in the UK so I don't know what options you have for care, but definitely look in to it. It might also be time to consider respite care (care home).

Again, I'm so sorry!
Sadly, this is just the way of Alzheimer's for some. Your mom will have to grow a thick skin. And it's okay for her to admit it's too much. I know someone whose mom has started attacking with anything she can find, and there are worries that the toddler in the home may end up getting in the proverbial line of fire. They're working now to have her moved into a safer setting when she can't harm any of them. We had to do the same with my mom. It's hard, but it's best for everyone.
I'm sorry your mom is having this problem! Do they have any favourite songs that she can play for him? Sometimes music is helpful in calming and reminiscing.",2021-10-14 04:26:02,yamilluvia,q7vfy0
Alzheimers,Am I potentially causing her Alzheimers to progress by immediately resolving issues that cause her distress?,"I recently began helping to care for my grandma. I noticed when something is out of place or wrong in some way, I try to fix it as soon as possible. Ie she's  running out of something, the hummingbird feeders need more food, etc. She gets stuck on that one thing until it is resolved, bringing it up a several times throughout the day. It's obvious she's worried about it. She knows she isn't able to solve those problems.on her own anymore. 

Now, I try to fix the issue immediately so she isn't stressed, but I am wondering if I shouldn't  do that? If  I solve every issue, is that going to make her less able to deal with other stressors I don't have control over? Or is it for the best to make her time that she is still aware, easier for her?

Any thoughts on this would be helpful!","One of the things the neurologist who diagnosed my mom complimented me on was immediately filling in words Mom was struggling with. The doctor said that a lot of people make their loved ones struggle until they find the right word or give up, thinking it’ll make them use their brain and relearn the word in question, but this isn’t helpful. Maybe they’ll get the word back, maybe they won’t, but the frustration is very hard on them, and eventually, they’ll lose the word permanently anyways.

This isn’t like working with children, where effort will eventually forge new synapses, and they’ll learn. This is someone going through an unavoidable decline in faculties. Letting them struggle is not a help, it’s a stressor. 

You’re doing the right thing by putting right what your grandma is stuck on.
The progression, as I understand it, is due to brain cell death. Your help won’t cause that to accelerate. You are doing a great service for her. That being said, try and adapt things for her. If you can balance her doing what she is able and limit stress you are helping her stay as independent as possible. I always tried to preserve my mother’s dignity.
Unfortunately, the want to challenge her problem-solving skills will not slow down the disease any. I tried to do the same thing for my mom when she was in the diagnosed-but-still-early stages. She's bilingual, so I tried to keep her sharp with vocabulary flash cards.  She was absolutely willing to give it a shot, but as months passed, it became clear that the stress of ""correctly"" executing a task (i.e. proper word identification) outweighed any promise of stalling progression. It became clear that rolling with fhe madness - kindly correcting mistakes, not pointing out error, making necessities easily accessible, etc - helped more than introducing challenges or puzzles. Likewise, as the alz continued to mutate, we (my sister and i) switched our focus from helping mom maintain independence, to making sure her needs were immediately met a la assisted living.

My advice to you is to help make life easier to navigate as logic slips away. The early-mid part of the disease is incredibly emotionally difficult. Imagine trying to find your keys after getting lost in your own home, suddenly not recognizing where you are or who you are with. The panic that accompanies confusion is incredibly overwhleming. The emotional reaction to confusion will continuously overshadow any logical processing as the alz takes hold. Alzheimers is one nasty bastard. All you can do is be a kind voice and a warm hand to help ease the struggle.
 If you’ve ever heard a vinyl record skip or repeat because it’s scratched or damaged - that’s a good way to understand what happens to our loved one’s brains. You usually have to intervene. There is no value in allowing them to stay in that loop of concern. The I y thing I would add is to give some positive feedback like “Thank you for noticing” “I”m glad you brought it to my attention” “I’m happy you reminded me - I was busy with X and didn’t notice.” It helps them feel as though they are not a burden.
There is no one answer for how to deal with issues as a caregiver. Long term, you need to deal with things in a way that causes YOU the least amount of stress because if you get burnt out then any kind of care you provide will be at a lower standard. As long as you provide a clean, healthy environment the decisions about how to do that are up to you.
Short answer: no. The disease will progress naturally in its own time. Sometimes very quickly, sometimes slowly. Forcing her to do things that cause her distress when it’s reasonable for you to do it only hurts her quality of life. 

This is a common misconception: That doing things for people that they used to do on their own, or that they “should” be able to do, is like aiding and abetting the disease and making it worse. That’s not how it works. Alzheimer’s progression can’t be staved off by forcing the patient to do things that are now difficult or cause them anxiety. My advice is to pay attention to what tasks or activities are more difficult or impossible to do without anxiety as the disease progresses and fill in the gaps. Unfortunately, eventually there will be more things you’re doing for her than not. That is Alzheimer’s. It’s hard enough as it is. A caregivers job is to minimize the suffering and it’s a huge toll. You will probably need help eventually if you don’t already have it.",2021-10-13 16:57:45,areyouviserious,q7kifv
Alzheimers,Hello! First time posting on this sub and I was wondering if anyone has had any experience traveling with someone that has Alzheimers.,"A little bit of a back story. My grandpa wants to have a family vacation. Unfortunately my grandmother has Alzheimer’s. For a few years she’s shown decline but it all really went downhill during pandemic and shutdown. Her speech is really affected. It’s hard to understand what she is saying. She has anxiety. She’ll have good days but then other days where she thinks we’re trying to kill her. Her anxiety gets worse if she’s tired too. Fortunately she can still care for her basic needs like brush her teeth, dress herself, use the bathroom. She remembers who her family is even if she forgets our names. And she also isn’t violent or rude. She’s very sweet. Everyone at her drs office loves her. I feel like my grandpa wants to have this family vacation because he feels like it might the last chance he’ll be able to with my grandma. We’ve seen a decline since the pandemic started and we’re afraid that it’s only going to get worse. That’s why I was wondering if anyone has any advice on traveling with some with Alzheimer’s or maybe someone has good reasons as to why we shouldn’t travel with her. I’m really open to hearing any type of advice or suggestions. We live in the usa and we were thinking of traveling on plane somewhere close (like 3 or 4 hours away).","The risk is that the entire thing- the trip to the airport- the plane ride - the new accommodations- the lack of routine may be overwhelming and could actually accelerate the decline.- but if she doesn’t recognize family I would stick much closer to home (like 2 hours in the car) or someplace they have visited on numerous occasions for 1 or 2 days max. Speak with the neurologist
Is there a place that your grandparents used to go regularly that she might recognize from past vacations? Does she wander? Is she accustomed to flying frequently? I wouldn’t recommend taking her somewhere new, unless you’re just planning an AirBnB trip where she can be closely monitored at all times. We heard in an Alzheimer’s Association support group that someone had business cards printed up that explained the situation simply (My mother has Alzheimer’s. Her name is Nancy. Please be kind.) and could be handed discreetly to people such as waitstaff.
Hi! I’m new here but am the primary caregiver for my father who was diagnosed with dementia 9 years ago. 

I would say do it; sounds (to me) like your grandmother is capable of this, but perhaps not for too much longer, which is the fear you mentioned your grandfather had. What I’ll say as someone who’s been in this for a long time, a bad day is worth it for a lifetime memory. Others may disagree, I wouldn’t blame them. My routine for flying with my father (while he still could) is as follows. Please keep in mind this was pre covid and the holidays are fast approaching. 

I pack for him and carry all ID’s, tickets, and money etc. I also go over what he wants to wear the day before. Obviously I give him a heads up but I try not to build it as something to worry and stress about, ie I try to treat it like one really long trip to the grocery store, far from ideal but doable, especially when I remind him why we need to travel (either for family or his health). I schedule the flight late morning/early afternoon so I have time to get him out of the house showered and fed without stressing him. Here again others may disagree; I would fib to my father about the departure time and give myself at least two extra hours. If it’s at two I’m telling him noon. I get there still another two hours early. And again, that’s the extra time I give myself, he often does use it for one reason or another, and if not then it’s been an easy day and you have time to relax. I bought him a bracelet with his medical info and our contact information, I make sure he’s wearing that. I try to stay calm and make it an adventure seeing all the people. I make sure he uses the restroom before boarding. When it’s time to board I use early boarding for people with disabilities. I’ve just found it’s so much easier to get seated and settled without people literally pushing you to go faster. Usually the flight itself isn’t too difficult (my father was a frequent flyer when he was healthy), I encourage him to sleep and I bring a pillow for it. Deboarding I usually wait until everyone gets off and I work hard not to have connections that could be close and that would cause us to rush. Yes, traveling is an all day thing unfortunately, no matter the destination. The bags, taxi, hotel are all usually pretty easy. If he keeps asking where we are I tell he what we’re doing there, and that makes more sense. So instead of We’re at X resort in Dallas it’s We’re seeing your sister. The first will confuse him, the second will please and satisfy him. He’ll definitely want to rest as soon as we arrive, and besides a small dinner that’s of course fine. I won’t schedule anything social for that night or even the next morning if possible. If the wedding for example is Saturday then Thursday is the latest I feel comfortable flying. 

People are different, their diseases are different, and how they’re effected is different. This was what worked for me after a few really difficult trips. It may not work for you or others. Sorry for the length, and my condolences on your grandmother.",2021-10-13 11:17:53,Upbeat-Cucumber-6996,q7debt

https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/research_progress/clinical-trials/trialmatch

Or a combination of searching univ or research hospitals in your area for investigators who have a history of Alzheimer's research. If you see a name listed they might also have publications listed on their staff page about their work. They might jave grad students who are working on less publicized projects. You can also search pubmed for studies and make note of any names and labs that might have a history of publishing in that area, googling them, and just cold calling or emailing them. A lot of times researchers are happy to hear from people who would be interested in their work. Good luck.

Even if they arent though, you could find out if they, or any other groups they know of, are recruiting for a similar study. What i would think would make this kind of study most interesting for someone like you is that its ""longitudinal,"" and even specifies ""mild cognitive impairment"" which i dont know if you have, but it can be a pre-Alzheimer's diagnosis maybe? As you say many studies are for those who already have Alzheimer's and are not tooo far along. So thats why id look for longitudinal studies at least. 

Also, this study is looking at genetics, which if you have that strong family history, genetics studies might be of special interest to you. I know some people in this sub have gotten genotyped at places like 23andme and stuff like that but i would be kind of cautious about that, as they aren't as tightly regulated, and are NOT required to be HIPAA compliant. But if you get genotyped as part of an NIH or university study for example, that study would likely have to be (not that its risk free, HIPAA laws are old and not airtight, but id feel safer about it). 

Oh heres one thats recruiting haha: https://www.alzheimers.gov/clinical-trials/longitudinal-early-onset-alzheimers-disease-study-leads

Ok a last thing to consider is *sometimes* participating in one study can exclude you from others! Of course this would be true for pharmaceutical trials, bc you dont want to be taking more than one experimental drug at a time, but it can also happen in studies where they do cognitive performance tests because they wouldn't want some kind of practice effect artificially affecting your scores. Sometimes, labs can share test results with other studies with your permission though... But its just something to keep in mind for the kind of studies I think youd be interested in.
Not sure where you've spent your time on this, but it's fairly well accepted that excercise (regular, sustained physical exertion) can reverse the disease (not saying completely make you have the mind of a 15 year old again, but some reversal, yes). Some foods are def. helpful. Ck the benefits of blueberries, walnuts and lion's mane mushrooms (all mushrooms)

Alzheimers,selfish vent…feel free to add yours.,"I came on here a while ago because I was in desperate need of some support due to my mom’s diagnosis. It’s been an incredibly stressful year, although I’ve been experiencing profound personal growth that I sometimes feel guilty for even finding the time to explore. Taking over someone’s entire life paperwork and becoming a POA feels like second job, I’m burnt out half the time and I shut down for a week at a time after each new “task,” because it’s never just that, is it? It’s a reminder that my parent is deteriorating and that I’m preparing for some difficult stuff, it hits me like a wave and takes so much out of me. I stop going out, not interested in entertainment, leave my books half read, and I mean forget about working out, I can’t even lift my arms. Everything halts like a bad depressive episode. It doesn’t happen every single time thankfully, and I’m getting better at bouncing back.

I couldn’t continue with the support group, doesn’t feel right yet. I guess because she hasn’t progressed too much since the new meds, or the fact that I feel bad for people who have it worse, fear of hearing about what’s to come, or all of the above. My siblings and I have been venting and supporting each other through it so I guess that kind of took over as well. I appreciate that we have a more matter of fact approach about it with each other.

Does anyone else with parents with Alzheimer’s wonder about their future with the disease? Can we stop saying it’s not guaranteed to happen? I mean maybe it’s not… but I feel that in order to defy the odds, you better have a damn good life. I mean no trauma, mental stress or other mental illness (bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety), have good sleeping habits, diet and exercise. Some of that we can control. But I’ve experienced a lot of trauma, and it makes me wonder how much damage has been done. My mom’s came on so damn early. She had some signs as early as her late 40s and we didn’t even figure it out. Her fucking late 40s. I want a family but I could never imagine putting this kind of pain and stress on people I love. I feel like I should just enjoy the time I have and do some good in the world, enjoy my hobbies &amp; career, travel, and just make a decision about my quality of life later on if I notice anything alarming… sorry if that’s dark. But another part of me wonders if that’s just a fear based decision that will rob me of having a husband and kids, and feeling that completeness I always wanted under my own roof. Who knows.","I hear you, and completely understand where you're coming from.  I have two parents with dementia (Alzheimers and Vascular) as well as a number of aunts and uncles with the disease (or who have died from it).  Even though it's not classified as hereditary, there certainly does seem to be strong familial links.

Unfortunately, I have nothing positive to add - the whole situation just fucking sux.  My heart breaks when I think of my once active, intelligent parents reduced to what they are now - they could be lots worse, I know ... and no doubt, in time, they will be.

Your feelings and concerns about the future are totally understandable - I have them, and I'd be surprised if anyone on this sub-reddit said they'd never had them.  I can't tell you what to do - only you can decide that.  Whatever you decide, I sincerely hope you have a great, fulfilling and happy life.
I understand. I’m taking care of my mother, who has a combo of Vascular and Alzheimer’s. We are so much alike physically that I often wonder/worry that I’m getting a first hand glimpse of my future. I don’t really know what advice to give. It’s best to do what is recommended. Exercise your body and mind, eat a Mediterranean diet, manage stress and try to get at least 7 hours sleep. Just do good things for yourself. Don’t stop living.
Same! I have a partner who dealt with a dying mother for many years, so you're going to meet tender, loving people through this; we find each other. So you'll have a life, I am positive. 

Also, research is about to give us an excellent treatment/cure. The largest generation ever on the planet has a 50% chance of getting this disease, so the motivation for a cure is definitely there, and research is progressing rapidly. We have hope. 

The hardest part of guardianship for me is exactly zero other family members have even offered support. It's 100% my responsibility to take care of my mom and her money is gone and I'm into my savings. Emotionally it is devastating to worry about how long my mom will live and also keep writing checks off my own account. 

I have a specialist/therapist I check in with and an attorney who deals with court requirements, but the stack of my mom's paperwork grows and grows and I resent it. There should be more simplicity and support. 

Talking to my mom is like being in a Stephen King novel and the pressure of extra carers watching at times almost breaks my brain. It's hard and you're not alone. It's a nightmare and when it ends, we're left with nothing for all the suffering. 

I switched therapists when my last one wanted me to see this ""opportunity"" as a ""blessing"". Find a counselor who is either a hospice volunteer or has dealt with Alzheimer's or both, my advice. 

Anyway we're here.
Wow..I dealt with my mother several years ago..her mother had 'it', all her 5 bros n sis' had 'it'..and yes I'm seeing things that I do that make me say ""damn, that's the shit my mom did"".
You have to do YOU..You can't do very much 'good' for someone else if YOU aren't in a good spot(or a better place) yourself. Your health is priority 1.
It's sad, but what's gonna happen with 'moms n dads' is gonna happen..we are the ones left behind with ALL the 'whys, when and how's' did this happen.
So sorry to say it like that, but you gotta do YOU at this point of your life. Stay positive (I know, impossible, right?'). Stay HEALTHY. Let's all hope a cure for this disease is coming sooner than later.
I hear you, OP. I have a lot of the same feelings. Talking or doing anything with my mom sends me into such a depression that I need to back off for a while and then I feel guilty for not doing more and being more involved. 

My mom was also diagnosed young, around the same age as your mom. I found it so hard to pursue any sort of support group because I feel like I just can’t relate. Everyone in the support group is the same age as my mom, watching their parents go through it. I just felt disconnected because a lot of the grief I feel is from realizing my mom won’t be involved in my wedding, in my future kids life’s, etc. She was my biggest cheerleader when I started my masters degree and now she doesn’t remember that I’ve graduated.

I too sorry about my future with the disease. I have ADHD and some general anxiety/depression that can make me pretty forgetful and it send me into a panic every time. I try really hard to adopt a positive mindset and focus on living the type of life I want to live. 

Sorry, I feel like this turned into my own rant. Just want to say that I see you OP and related to this post a lot. This disease is truly the ugliest and I hope that we are able to see big steps towards a cure in our lifetime
I have found the decisions made from fear are usually bad.  Talk to a medical professional about the risk factors and treatments that are coming online.  It may make you feel better.  My mother's grandmother had alzheimer's.  But no on else in the family but her and my mom did. 

That said,  I understand what you are going through.  My dad died this summer.  Overnight I became Mom's POA and the executor of Dad's estate.   The paperwork feels never ending.  I am really feeling the responsibility of taking care of her finances.  It can be crushing.  

The best advise I can give is find yourself a support system and take it one day at a time.  Looking too far into the future is a good way to make yourself nuts.",2021-10-12 23:16:39,here_fornow,q72d49
Alzheimers,Gave my Father w/ Alzheimer's Some Joy,"Just some good news that I really wanted to share with some people. 

Background: I am in college (19F), my father is (83M) and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about a year and a half ago but has been suffering form memory decline as well as health issues for far longer dating all the way back to about my freshman year of high school. We've always been close due to the fact that we're very similar personality wise and his Alzheimer's has been hitting me really hard, especially since I'm so young and am currently in college so I'm no longer always there to help him. 

He's always loved music. He played in his school's band growing up and either has perfect pitch or something extremely close to it, to the point that he never learned to read music and simply listened and recreated it the next moment. His birthday was last month and I bought two tickets for him to see the symphony that was putting on a Beethoven concert in the city where I go to college (him and my mom live about an hour away in a smaller city that doesn't have these kind of opportunities.) 

I bought the tickets for him and my mom to go, intending it to be a sort of date, but my mom told me that I should go with him. I've always been musical as well, not to the extent that my father was, but it's always something my dad and I have been able to bond over. My mom, in comparison, is hilariously tone-deaf and readily admits so. So, I agreed and my dad and I decided to go together instead. 

I took my parents out to dinner beforehand and then me and my dad went to the symphony while my mom went to a bookstore. 

My dad loved it. 

Loved it is a total understatement. He was absolutely enthralled with the music. I bought the cheapest tickets available (college am i right lol) but they ended up being in the very front row. I was worried it might be too loud for my dad with his hearing aids, but he didn't complain or say anything. The entire time he was watching with so much attention and joy and wouldn't stop telling me how exciting it was to be so close to a real orchestra and how he'd never been to a symphony before. 

He cried multiple times. Tears of joy and not unusual bc my dad's always been more sensitive and his emotional regulation has gotten worse with the Alzheimer's. During intermission he sat and talked to me about how wonderful this was and would sing some of the parts from the symphony that he thought were particularly amazing. 

When it ended it was far later then my dad usually stays up (he's old and was a military man so he's usually in bed by 6-7 PM) but he was so full of energy afterward!! On the car ride back to meet with my mom he continued to tell me how magnificent it was, how much he enjoyed it, how grateful he was to me for taking him, etc.  I hadn't seen him smile that much in months. 

It was such a surreal experience. I was so happy that I could do something so good for my dad, bring him some joy in his life again. He told me hat it was something he'd ""never forget"" and even though I know that's probably not true, it almost brought tears to my eyes hearing it. My mom was glad that she got to take some 'her' time (she lives with my dad, is younger then him, and although my dad is still capable of basic functions my mom always cooks and cleans) and I was happy to have done something so good for both my parents. 

TL;DR my dad has Alzheimer's and loves music. I bought him and me symphony tickets and he absolutely adored it. It was a magical experience for my dad that I'll cherish forever.","I think many of us hope for the chance to share that kind of moment with our loved ones after their diagnosis, but you pulled it off. How wonderful you were able to both give him this and share it with him. 

A word of advice? Start writing down everything you can about your father. Memory fades, and you are young. Give yourself as much to remember him by as possible.
how wonderful!! unfortunately my MIL went from undiagnosed to in a home and unable to hold a conversation during the pandemic. :( 

i’m glad you got to take him out. Cherish it!
You did good! My wife also likes music but is too far along to go to see anything live but we see quite a few things she likes on AXS TV channel. Good God, Jewel is irritating but I'll sit through it for her.

Maybe some DVDs of symphonies would make him happy.
Enjoy it, and do more of it while he’s able. 

I managed to get my mom to the local botanical garden for her birthday in May, about a week before I had to place her in memory care. She tired easily, but was glad to get out and see something pretty for a change.
You’re a great kid, sounds like a beautiful night & memory. Glad you all got to enjoy it 🙏
How wonderful! Music is a language he still speaks and you're giving him a way to connect, or a going into his world with him. That's love! 

My mom can't hold a conversation, but sings the lyrics to so many songs. Music is her language now, too.
That’s awesome! Brings tears to my eyes ❤️",2021-10-12 17:22:23,adviceasker128,q6w0t4
Alzheimers,"Dad has Alzheimer’s and is being treated with Seroquel for anger/aggression, but…",It seems to be having the opposite effect. Have other folks had this experience? It’s getting to the point where the memory care facility might ask us to find another facility.,"Talk to his doctor ASAP.  That’s my only advice.  People react differently to meds.
Definitely second the talk to the doctor part. The problem is that none of these drugs are indicated specifically for the agitation/aggression/rage of Alzheimer’s. There are currently no drug approved specifically for this. So the off-label use is all essentially trial and error. At one point we had to admit my mom to a specialized geriatric psych unit so they could stabilize her medication. She was there like 2 or 3 weeks. I think up to like 100 days total or something like that is covered by Medicare.

Also, if they haven’t already checked, make sure to test for a UTI. They can often cause sudden behavior changes.
I just went through this with my dad last year. Message me if you want to talk more. I feel like I can be very helpful. Sadly I think you may need to prepare yourself because it sounds like you’re going to be on the same wild rollercoaster ride I was on. Of course I got on that one right after the caregiving rollercoaster ride ended. It’s an entirely different ride. 

So your dad was aggressive Ect then the doc decided to treat his Alzheimer’s symptom with seroquel (assuming a therapeutic dose was given for the appropriate amount of time) and he got worse or stayed the same? Is this the first one they have used? Can they try another one? Or they don’t want him off the seroquel? Can they add a med to work in conjunction with the seroquel? What other things are being done to help him through his difficult behaviors besides giving him drugs? Has the staff identified his triggers? What deescalation techniques are used? Did they check the aggression isn’t a reaction to something else going on, like having to pee, thirsty, dizzy, did something wrong and is trying to hide it (pooped pants so no one can go in the room the pants are in), has a toothache, uti, something hurts, losing vision or hearing, are they afraid, uncomfortable, Ect. Did these behaviors develop slowly? Aka because of alz or did they come out of no where? Typically means somethings medically wrong like uti infection sprained ankle idk. 

I know I asked a lot of questions. It’s totally okay if you can’t answer all of these questions but you should ask them and know them. Your dad can’t advocate for himself so you have to do this for
Him.
Occasionally those drugs can have an opposite effect, yes.  Seroquel is typically the preferred drug because it is less likely to cause parkinsonism.

It is best to make sure there's not something else like a UTI or something causing delirium though.
My mom got kicked out of two places in the past five years. Seroquel did nothing. She ended up breaking her wrist attacking one resident, attacking another and trying to bash that person's head into a wall. She had to be sedated twice when attacking nurses and EMTs. The only thing that worked for her were Haldol injections, but that required 24/7 nurses for the injections, which moved her out of state as my state has no communities with 24/7 nurses and dementia wards with locking doors. UTIs were found one with one of the attacks, but not the others. She simply flies into a rage, typically if someone tries to help her shower, dress, or clean up after an accident.
If possible, get him an appointment with a neurologist for an evaluation or ask his primary care doctor to send him to a geriatric inpatient psychiatric unit so they can work on getting him stabilized on meds.  Many medications have an opposite undesirable effect on elderly patients and a psychiatric team can try him on different ones to see what helps.  This is what we did for my dad because nursing homes were finding it difficult to keep him due to his behavioral issues.  Sometimes a good medication combo is the only option to prevent involuntary discharge from a nursing home.
Unfortunately he passed away in a nursing home in a locked unit, which few facilities have.  His behavior deteriorated to the point he had to be housed in a locked area of the NH.  He thought he was in jail.  Today, most nursing homes will not accept individuals with behavioral issues.  It is a nightmare experience for the many families who encounter these end-of-life issues with elderly loved ones.",2021-10-10 13:08:03,clifton63,q5c5jx
Alzheimers,Not fun.,Been a full time caregiver to my gran for 3 years. The next time someone says “you should try looking after kids” I will scream at them.,"Wow. Who ever said this to you does not understand AT ALL how difficult it is to look after a fully grown adult experiencing mental decline.
Kids can be a handful but their cuteness redeems them.. and they grow up.

Very sad for your gramma.  It is very very hard looking after an elderly person who has Alzheimers/dementia  and stops being your dear Gran and just keeps getting worse.
The way I explained it is at least kids you know will grow out of it, where you know things are only going to go downhill with someone suffering from Alzheimer’s. That sometimes helped…
Gimme a call, I'll come help you scream at them!!  grrrr...

Alzheimers,'The Father' - go see it,"I just finished watching 'The Father', a new film released about Dementia, starring Sir Anthony Hopkins.  


It is incredible.  


Without saying too much about it, the film successfully manages to paint a vivid picture of this awful disease and how it affects both the patient and family members.  


It really hits home. Moreover, it has given me a much-needed boost of sympathy (which I hope will last). The next time i lose my patience I will try my absolute best to rise above it and imagine just how scary it must be.  


Go watch it and spread the word on this film if you can. The more awareness this awful condition gets the more chance it has that one day a cure will arrive.",[deleted],2021-10-09 17:45:22,tinytempo,q4urv6
Alzheimers,"Mom has progressed so fast, and it's unbearable","I've posted about my mom a couple of times before, and she's even worse since the first time I posted a couple of months ago. I guess I just need to vent. She's 64 and was diagnosed with early-onset in July after a year of suspicions, ruling everything else out, and trying to get to the point of diagnosis.

She has lived with me for 8 months as of last week, and I am really just trying to catch my breath at the realization of how bad she's gotten in this timeframe. She already doesn't recognize me, though she knows I am someone she is comfortable with. She thinks she has another daughter, another version of me. Earlier this week, she even tried to tell me she had kids, plural. It's constantly ""my shady-pines-ma,"" ""the other shady-pines-ma,"" but if I ask her what my name is, she'll say it's her name, or she just doesn't know. I asked her if she had other kids, why aren't they here taking care of her, and of course, she doesn't know how to answer that. Sometimes, she'll call out ""mom"" as if she is genuinely calling for her mom to come do something for her. Last week, she asked me if I knew where mom was. Or sometimes, she'll ask me where my mom is. I knew we would deal with that at some point, I just didn't know it would be this soon. She doesn't resonate with the way she used to tell me she loved me ""I love you to infinity and beyond,"" or ""you are my happy thought"" anymore. 

She'll ask me if I know her brothers (my uncles), or she'll ask me if I knew her parents, and then in the same breath, she'll threaten them in some way for ""not telling her"" about me as if it's some sort of conspiracy. It's so rough and surreal. I know she's basically Benjamin Buttoning, and I feel like we're in her teenage years right now, but also teetering on toddler. The way she talks back to me sometimes now can be incredibly upsetting, especially if I'm already at my bullshit limit for the day. I don't think I ever had the same attitude with her when I was an actual teenager. She has also said some incredibly awful and mean spirited things to me like wishing that I get Alzheimer's and die when she's really upset. I'm truly at the point where I wish she would just die already, and it hurts me so much to think that when I used to be terrified at the thought of life without her. I know it will be a bittersweet relief when she is finally gone.

She cannot be left alone, even if I'm only just outside for a short amount of time, and when I am able to get someone to look after her for a short while, she has major separation anxiety and just cannot settle down and is very restless. It's exhausting. I went out to organize something in the garage, left her with a show on, things should have been fine. Came back inside after 30 minutes, she had eaten 4/6 bananas that I had bought barely 12 hours before from grocery shopping last night. They were meant to last her the whole week. She also had taken her shirt off, but was very adamant that she only ate one banana and that I had told her to take her shirt off. The four banana peels in the garbage and the half of a banana I found on top of the toilet says otherwise. I now have what are supposed to be child proof covers on my deadbolt locks and child proof door knob covers on my doors in an effort to prevent her from wandering out unsafely and getting lost. I'm screwed if she figures out the deadbolt covers in particular. I'm really hoping the doorknob covers are enough of a deterrent as well, but I know she could totally figure them out if she really wanted to. We'll see about those I guess and hope for the best. 

I spent a good chunk of change on a really nice medical ID bracelet, and she does a great job of keeping it on 24/7, so there's that, but she really has no idea how to use her phone anymore, and there would be zero guarantee she could use it or even think to use it in an emergency. I almost feel like it might just be best to cancel her phone plan and direct anyone who wants to talk to her to call me. Does anyone have any input on that? I'm genuinely curious to know how you've handled your loved one's phone privileges. She also says she sees people and hears voices telling her things. It's always ""someone was here,"" ""they said this,"" ""last night when they were here,"" etc., but she can never actually tell me what ""they"" are doing or saying to her. She really can't tell me anything of purpose anymore, or when she does seem like she has something to say, it's never anything relevant, and it's all half thought out and incomplete with zero sense to be made of it. She still has most of her speech function, but it is limited and childlike, or just straight up delusional.

She is constantly moving and hiding things that belong to both of us. She won't stop taking pictures I have out of frames, especially ones of me as a child because they're pictures of *her* shady-pines-ma. She's lost two that I've now had on my refrigerator for years, and they're the only copies of these two pictures in particular that I had. I ended up taking everything decorative off of the fridge in defeat. She'll take things from my craft workspace and put them on her nightstand. She put a metal canning jar lid in the toilet. She took the finial off of her nightstand lamp one morning, I screwed it back on, and then later in the day it was gone and completely missing. The TV remote is currently MIA for the past few days. We can turn it on and at least watch streaming stuff through the other input, but it's stuck on one channel for now until we can find it. When she's not doing that, she's pulling books, CDs and DVDs off of the bookshelf and spreading them all over the room. I'm going to be boxing those up this weekend in an out of sight, out of mind, effort.

She can't bathe herself completely anymore. If she is supposed to be washing her hair or her body, she'll just pour shampoo or body wash into her hands and rub her hands together vigorously, but in the same breath, has no idea what she's supposed to do to wash her hands in the sink. She doesn't know how to brush her teeth anymore. She can't go to the bathroom independently anymore most of the time, I'm having to be in there pulling her pants down and making her sit on the toilet. My subconscious has learned to wake up in the mornings on the weekend when I hear her wandering into the bathroom, and I hate it. Otherwise, she'll just sit on the toilet fully clothed and pee. The disposable underwear can only hold so much. She pooped her pants again earlier this week (we're now on the third time that's happened, and I know that number will continue to rise), and stuck her hands in it, and then got it all over her pillows. Or she'll wander into the bathroom, turn on the light, and walk right back out. Or there was the time this week where she walked into the bathroom and dumped water from her glass into the toilet. Oh, and let's talk about how she wastes toilet paper and tissue now. She'll unroll toilet paper and just leave it on the counter or stash it in a drawer, but never actually uses it to wipe herself like she's supposed to, or she'll pull tissues out of the box and scatter them around so she can use the tissue box like a storage container for pictures or trash.


We have toured an adult day-care center, but she isn't able to go yet, because I can't do their specific pick up and drop off times with my work schedule. I had to fill out an application for our county's transit authority to be able to do that, but they sent back the application I filled out because I didn't provide proof that I had the right to fill out the form, so now I have to send proof of my POA and start over. I've also finally spoken with a company for in-home respite care, but it's going to take a few weeks for that to get in motion too. Memory care is the final boss, and the financial situation is overwhelming. It seems like I won't be able to avoid protecting her assets and we're going to have to do a spend down anyway before I can get any other assistance. Her money is going to go so fast. My sanity and making sure she has the proper care is a priority though, so it is what it is. I'm hoping to have her placed ASAP. Before spring comes if I can help it. Some of the referral agents I've spoken with are really recommending I keep her close by, but our area (Bay Area) is so expensive. I feel like the money would stretch a bit further if I get her a couple of hours away, but I've been attempted to be talked out of it in a ""well, what happens if something happens and you need to get to her quickly?"" manner, but at this point, I almost don't care. I know it will also limit how often I'm able to visit her and spend time with her, but I feel like I'm okay with that too. That's just how I feel about her and our situation right now. I don't know. I just don't know. Twice now, it's been recommended to me to just leave her at an ER and tell them I can't care for her anymore, but that seems like the worst thing I could possibly do. What would even happen if I did that?

She is just so far gone, and has the emptiest look in her eyes. She truly has no idea what the hell she's doing anymore. I almost just feel so gaslit, but I know it's the Alzheimer's gaslighting both of us. At the same time, I have completely detached from her as well. I love her and I hate her, and I hate that I hate her. I just miss my mom and it really sucks that she's still here but not still here. I want someone to take care of me. I am running on empty, and the only reason I haven't had a complete mental breakdown yet is because I can't afford to. I am in therapy, and trying to find actual support groups are still on my to-do list, although on the flip side of the idea of a support group, what's the point? We all just share our feelings? She also got denied by her insurance to try the Rivastigmine patch (Donepezil caused severe gastric upset and dehydrated her to the point she was hospitalized for three days shortly after she moved in with me), and we certainly can't afford it out of pocket. I don't even think it would make a difference at this point, though either. The hardest part about this too, is knowing that she could be on a fast track to the end, but completely plateau for years after all of this, until the actual end. Not having any kind of timeline or prognosis to the end is hard. She is moderate to severe though, I know that much. It has progressed that fast in just a year of first realizing something was wrong with her.

I'm so angry still, it blows my mind. I saw a post on FB a few weeks ago that read ""Someone said 'anger is sadness that had nowhere to go for a really long time' and I'll never forget it,"" and it's so fucking true. This is the most extreme sadness and anger that I have ever felt, and I can feel how utterly toxic and harmful it is. I feel like a prisoner and an indentured servant, and I know she feels like she's a prisoner too. I still just can't believe this is our life, and that makes me so sad. If you've read this, thanks.","Ugh. I am so sorry and I have absolutely no words of wisdom for you. My husband is still really early stage. But oh my gosh, you are an incredibly eloquent writer. You described so perfectly the shit show that is your life, and I wish I could just reach out and hug you. I hope you find peace, and soon. You deserve it. You are doing your absolute best and you should be given a medal. Sending ❤️ your way…
So sorry you are going thru this. Just lost my dad last week to Alzheimer’s. I thought I would be more prepared for his death, but it’s still really tough. My mom also has dementia and she’s going downhill pretty quickly. It’s such a terrible disease. I’ve definitely felt how you felt. There are days where I’m like am I ever going to be happy again. It’s like a dark cloud over me everyday. Just wanted to let you know you’re not alone.
 Something I learned recently is some facilities offer respite care for like a week or a month or whatever, which could give you a chance to breathe and get your thoughts in order on the next step. I had no idea,so, just in case.
 You totally nailed it with the gaslighting thing, choosinghappiness1 is right you are a good writer.Take care of yourself, you're doing your best. This disease is brutal.
I’m so, so sorry for what you and your mother are going through. I feel like getting her into a memory care facility ASAP in your only answer. If you can find a place that does elderly waiver you won’t need to worry about what happens when the money runs out. Don’t let others influence your decision, you just need to get her into a safe situation for now. Once she is settled you can regroup, get some rest, and start thinking about the long term picture. You can always move her to a different place once you’ve been able assess the situation without the 24/7 stress of caring for her.
I understand and feel for you.  And so sorry that your Mum is so young and yourself too, to be going through this hell.

I hope you find assistance and relief soon.
I feel your pain. My mother is advancing quickly but has quit communicating or speaking at all. However she can still read sheet music and play the piano for other residents at her Alzheimers home. Try to distract your mom with music she grew up listening to when she was in her teens.
Hi Shady-pines-ma. Echo what everyone else has said here. In regards to the phone privileges specifically, I did what you mentioned and cancelled her phone plan. I let family and friends know they could email me to schedule a time to speak to my mom, or even better, send an iPhone video of themselves saying hi and giving a life update. That way they can be replayed for her. Also, check out the organization Hilarity for Charity. They have caregiver respite grants you can apply for if you can’t get your mom in somewhere soon. https://wearehfc.org/programs/grant-program/

Big hugs.
I am going to private message you with my contact information. My mother was diagnosed at 44 when I was 24. My brother was also diagnosed at 44 - I was 40. I have learned so much & would given anything to talk to someone when my mom was sick. No one can wave a magical wand & make this go away. However, having support from someone that understands what its like to take care of a parent with early onset - it can be helpful & good for your sanity. There were so many times when I screamed, when I cried - at times I pleaded with my mother to not ask me that same question over & over again. It wasn’t the fact that I had to constantly repeat myself- it was episodes like that where I saw how sick she was and it freaked me out!! Feel free to reach out!",2021-10-09 16:07:49,shady-pines-ma,q4syke
Alzheimers,My mom has early onset Alzheimer’s and never told me,"My grandmother is currently in a nursing home in Greece with Alzheimer’s (we live in the U.S.). When my grandmother was being diagnosed/treated prior to her move to the nursing home, the doctor apparently tested my mother for early onset as well and it turns out that she has it. This was maybe 5 or so years ago. My mom refused treatment and never told me or my brother. Over the last year she has definitely been showing signs of Alzheimer’s that my brother and I are all too aware of from taking care of our grandmother. On top of that, my mom drinks heavily (to the point of blacking out nightly) which of course doesn’t help with her symptoms. I’ve talked to her numerous times about her symptoms and the other day she finally admitted that she has early onset Alzheimer’s and refuses any treatment. Obviously I’m pissed and I have no idea what to do. She’s too stubborn to hear me out and keeps saying she will let me know when it’s getting bad and will go to a nursing home in Greece when the time is right. That makes zero sense though as we are all in the U.S. and we can’t afford to be traveling back and forth to Greece to see her. We want to come up with a plan now but she refuses.
On top of that, I’m pregnant with my first child (her first grandchild) and she’s super excited and wants to be very involved in his life. I can’t let that happen. She doesn’t even remember to feed herself so how could I trust her to feed/change a child if I weren’t around? She also doesn’t know current safe sleep practices for babies. I’ve tried explaining them to her but she keeps forgetting and suggesting I buy/do things that could lead to SIDS in my baby. So of course I can’t trust her. 
With the baby on the way, my husband and I will not have room in our home to take care of her. My brother and his fiancé are not financially stable enough to care for my mom so we’re all stuck in a predicament. 
Does anyone have any suggestions on what we could possibly do or how we could better plan for her to inevitably be placed in a nursing home?","Until your LO becomes very incapacitated (such as walking around naked down Main Street in ten below weather), you can't force treatment on her.  You can get her driver's license taken away, if she's still driving (phone her doctor's office or the DMV).  Don't worry about the grandparenting thing.  You will never leave that baby alone with her, but she can certainly look on from the sidelines.  You can't prevent your mother from drinking (but you don't have to enable her getting the alcohol).  

Contact the Aging and Disability Resource Center for your area for a lot more help.

You didn't state your mother's age, but she probably could take advantage of a senior center for your area.  They may have music, art, exercise, and social programs that she could surprisingly enjoy.  You might take her there for lunch one day (if they offer that) and sit and enjoy it together.  Or home-delivered meals (such as Meals on Wheels) might appeal to her.

Good luck.  It's so vexing when someone refuses help.  Maybe as she becomes more disabled, she will be less resistant.",2021-10-09 11:50:25,misanthrope8,q4ny41

Alzheimers,Are there any indications that simufilam is different from promising AD drugs that failed in phase 3?,"Hoping this is the right forum for asking this question. I've read about a new drug - simufilam - that has started phase 3 trials, and although there seem to be some citizen petitions going on to delay the studies, the results so far seem very, very promising. I remember hearing about blockbuster AD drugs that did well in phase 2 but ultimately flopped in phase 3 ([this article](https://scrip.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/SC097113/Surprise-Its-A-Phase-III-Failure) lists those from Pfizer and Eli Lilly). 

I know nothing's guaranteed what happens in phase 3, but it seems like the FDA is very eager to do something about the AD epidemic, what with its controversial approval of aduhelm. I was wondering, though, if anyone could provide a medical or pharmacological perspective on if simufilam sets itself apart from other drugs that have come and gone in terms of efficacy or mechanisms, and if the results so far are to be taken very seriously. Thank you in advance!","The other AD drugs never demonstrated clinical benefit. They were allowed to go to Phase 3 due to people buying into this novel mechanism of action based on biomarkers. So when they did the Phase 3 trial, they got the same result of the early trials as to having no effect.

Simufilam is different because they have measured cognition (memory, recall, math, word finding, etc.) and it made a big difference. There's an actual clinical benefit that is measured, and it is significant. Patient's families also notice the difference. It helps that Phase 3 is a repeat of Phase 2 in terms of using the same cognitive tests, so you expect to get the same results as Phase 2. Often drugs fail because Phase 3 is a completely different type of trial, or there was no Phase 2 trial to begin with. So you don't know what to expect.

The main reason for drugs failing Phase 3 is lack of efficacy. Some Phase 2 drugs demonstrate efficacy, yet fail Phase 3. Why is this? Well, these Phase 2 had small sample size and was only 1-2 months long. Simufilam has a decent sample size, pretty large for a Phase 2. It is also very long at 12 months and still ongoing.

Another reason for failure of Phase 3 is when earlier trial is based on very subjective testing. For example, a facial cream where the user just gives a subjective rating on whether their face feels better or not (real example). When the Phase 3 is done, the double blinding shows no effect and this is not really a surprise as the Phase 2 was really rudimentary. The odds are against a random drug working.

The placebo effect is often a problem. For simufilam however, you have the Aduhelm placebo data to compare. It uses the same gold standard method for AD drugs making this comparison valid. At 12 months, simufilam patients improved by +3.2 points while placebo in the Aduhelm trial got -4 points, making it a 7.2 point difference. This effect size is so large thus a statistical anomaly is very unlikely. This also means you only need data from the first 50 of the 750 enrolled patients in Phase 3 to declare the results statistically significant and halt the trial early. In addition, 68% of the patients improved and 98% percent derived some sort of clinical benefit compared to the expected decline. This is not a few super-responders skewing the data.

While you can't understand the test without access to ADAS-Cog, a proprietary test, you can google the MOCA test which is very similar. It's not a test that you can cheat. There is still some subjectivity on the part of the exam scorer (the physician), but this is only a few points. It would not explain the consistent month to month improvement of patients on simufilam. The Phase 2 data was also performed by 16 independent clinics and examined by 2 independent statisticians, who both arrived at the same calculations.

Lastly, there is the biomarker data. The improvement is among several different biomarkers that are highly regarded by scientists as important in AD, because the levels are abnormal in AD patients. Unlike Aduhelm, simufilam doesn't have any direct binding to any of these biomarkers. It affects something upstream, which is then represented in changes in these biomarkers. This makes it more likely that simufilam would be successful.

I've done drug development research for Pfizer and I am a neurologist. I've been obsessed in researching this stock since May, and I'm almost 100% certain that this drug is going to get FDA approval. I am 60% certain that it will get early approval of which there are multiple avenues to obtain. The data is just so good.
I took this from someone who posted in the Cassava subreddit. I’m not neuroscientist. I’m a lawyer but I’m hopeful that Cassava is the answer for AD.
The P2 results are strikingly better than anything I have seen before: 3+ point improvement over 12 months versus a typical 5.82 point drop on the ADAS-Cog 0-70 point scale.  All other trials have aimed at showing slower decline - but simufilam showed improvement.  Obviously, P3 is everything because it will be bigger and more rigorous than the P2.  Fingers crossed that there is finally an effective AD treatment and this could be it.
Cassava is certainly doing things differently. Instead of presenting strong biomarker data backed up by decades of steady research and dozens of peer-reviewed articles, they have elected to rely on this open-label data and a mechanism of action that is so specious no one in AD research can really make heads or tails of it.",2021-10-08 14:30:32,CMBYMN,q43rm1
Alzheimers,Activities for people with relatively high functioning memory decline,"My 78 year old mom recently developed significant short term memory loss. She's mostly functional (she can feed herself, move around, use the bathroom unassisted, bathe herself, prepare simple meals), but her memory suffers after about 10 - 20 minutes. 

She likes to stay active and I'm trying trying to find ways for her to fill her time. Reading doesn't hold her attention anymore, because she can't follow a narrative. Same with tv/movies. She putters around in the garden when the weather is nice.  I set her up with lumocity, which she seems to enjoy, but she can't do that all day. She spends a lot of time doing chores like laundry and cleaning. I don't want that to be all she does.

I'd love to hear any thoughts or suggestions you have. Thanks","Don't discount laundry and cleaning. They help her feel useful, which is good for her self-esteem and they help her retain her mobility and some strength.

My MIL is now in memory care, so some of this is when we visit her.

My MIL loves looking through old photo albums even if she doesn't remember who the people are, bonus if she's in the pictures and we can explain who the people with her are.  

She loves music of any kind, and remembers all kinds of songs from her youth, which are some of her last memories.  Sometimes she doesn't remember us, and she can't dress herself any more, but she remembers songs.

Simple crafts like coloring bring her joy.

Pinterest has a ton of ideas!
Mindfulness colouring books for adults are brilliant, you can also get some brilliant jigsaw puzzles with small numbers of pieces but still look appropriate for adults (in the UK I buy these on the Alzheimer society website shop). Their whole online store has loads of brilliant activities ideas. My mom used to be really good at sewing so I also got her some simple cross-stitch things, and these plastic shapes with holes in (for kids) which she then laces up with shoelaces and then unlaces etc.

My biggest advice is to get her to attend an adult day centre, even for 1 day a week. It's a bit hard at first getting them to settle in and get used to it but the pay off has been so worthwhile. The sooner you do it, the easier it will be, before she declines too much..even if it's a half day a week it will be so worth it for her, and for you. Th stimulation and support they provide is invaluable. Good luck to you with everything.
My gran has a piano lesson over FaceTime once a week. Learning to play tunes from her earlier years seems to help.
Aerogarden for winter gardening. 
And I second everyday tasks such as laundry and cleaning. Even if there's something you don't really need help with, anything to make them feel useful is key.
There are different types of mental stimulation so try to get a variety like, crossword puzzles, word searches, SUDOKU, math equation worksheets, if they speak a second language anything to keep that up, meal prep, matching socks, sweeping is good for tracking and eye hand coordination.  Make a YouTube account and make playlists of music they like, especially love concerts they are very engaging.",2021-10-08 12:04:16,sedatesnail,q40ruv
Alzheimers,Mild cognitive decline has worsened significantly in the past year,"My mom's partner has been showing signs of worsening cognitive decline for the past year. It began at the height of lockdown, when he was under a lot of stress, and started with sporadically forgetting random recent events while impulsively and passive-aggressively acting out. He's never been an easy person to deal with, so we assumed it was just the sort of stress and anxiety most of us were dealing with through the pandemic.

He was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment last fall and put on donepezil, and has been taking curcumin supplements as well. He has categorically refused to make any lifestyle changes though. He stays up for over 24 hours at least one day a week (he's been doing this consistently for over around fifteen years), and hasn't maintained a normal sleep schedule for the last several months. He's constantly awake. He complains about waking easily because of everyday sounds other people make, but will not use earplugs or a white noise machine as suggested. He's also been prescribed sleeping pills to help insomnia, but refuses to take them. 

My mom has tried for the past year to get him to exercise regularly, but he refuses - this includes light exercise like going for a daily walk. He will only go if she accompanies him, but she has her own health issues that leave her exhausted after work. His primary activities are basically watching TV dramas whenever he's awake (this goes on for 6-12 hours a day) and going to work. He's alienated his relatives and friends by being critical and emotionally abusive, so he also gets very little meaningful social contact.

On top of this, his diet is dismal. He has always refused to prepare his own food, relying instead on my mom to do it for him. She works full-time at a high-stress job, so she rarely has time to prepare healthy meals for him. She does buy brain-friendly foods (fatty fish, walnuts, greens, etc) for him to prep and eat but this is also someone who has, for decades, refuses to prep a meal and clean up after himself. Unless he has food cooked and served to him, he'll subsist off sugary, high-carb snacks and coffee loaded up with sugar and cream. It probably doesn't help that he also vapes nicotine constantly, or that he's been a lifelong smoker until a few years ago.

In the last few months, my mom has noted that he'll forget events that happened that day, and that he'll repeat the same stories and phrases over and over. He constantly forgets belongings like his phone or even his work paychecks. He also now seems to have trouble with basic things like knowing road rules, but has been able to keep commuting to work because it's a route he's taken daily for over a decade. He's always been a very angry person, but seems to have trouble controlling it effectively now. He vacillates between giving my mom the silent treatment for imagined slights, throwing temper tantrums, and begging her not to leave him. It has just been a lot to deal with.

He's now on both donepezil and memantine, but has shown no improvement. I guess I'm asking what we can do, or what to expect in the coming years, especially when he refuses to do things he needs to do to maintain his health. I don't know what we can even do for him anymore.","My dad showed 0 improvement from the Memantine and Donepezil combo. I can’t say it made him worse but it certainly did not help at all. The side effects kept stacking with the side effects of other medication he takes, so he made the choice to discontinue. There was not one discernible improvement during the 1-2 years he was on both medications.
At some point you say ""enough.  You want to deteriorate?  Fine.  I won't stand in  your way.""

The fact is, he has a relentless course ahead and will die, sooner than later.  Why should he give up smoking?  He wants to die anyway.

He does need to go back to have further assessment, so it is possible to take away his driving privileges when that is necessary.  (My hunch is, right now.)",2021-10-07 16:27:02,fallondeafears,q3huqr

Alzheimers,My grandma has late stage Alzheimer's and I don't know how to help...,"Hello, I'm sorry about the long post..

(I also just want to preface before asking my question that I don't know very much about Alzheimer's  and as I haven't been directly involved with the situation so I can only explain what I've heard)

Some backstory first: My aunty has been living with my grandma for a very long time now (just for the convenience not so much because of health issues) and she began to notice sometime last year that my grandma (in her mid-90's) was showing symptoms of memory loss and a lack of appetite. My family does their best to call her and would visit regularly outside of quarantine, but each time they talk to her, her memory gets shorter.   
This afternoon my aunty called to speak to my mum and explained that she needs to come visit soon.   
My grandma's lack of appetite has gotten worse, to the point where she can no longer keep the few foods she was able to eat before down. Last week I overheard that my aunty got scared and almost called an ambulance because my grandma wouldn't respond to her questions - she just sat and stared.   
Another issue that they've been dealing with recently is my grandma forgetting to turn off the gas stove in the kitchen etc. - my aunty keeps having to watch her closely because of this.  


My grandma feels like she's being treated like a child and, to some degree, my aunty is doing just that.   
She understands that something isn't right but can't figure out what it is and when told, she can't remember it a couple of minutes later.   
Because my grandma still believes that she's able to take care of herself, they sometimes argue and a lot of tension has been created between them.   
A while ago my aunty started doing a course about Dementia and Alzheimer's, trying to understand it and some of the things that could help - but so far nothing seems to have worked or lasted. 

My question is, I guess, what do I do, or more like, how can ***I*** help?   
No one wants to involve retirement homes (I don't want this either) or a helper - although, I don't know what they'd be able to do to help other than ease my aunty's stress and provide emotional support.    
It just doesn't feel like there are many options, if any at all. Most of what I was trying to come up months ago (e.g. puzzles, colouring, reading, post-it notes around the house to help her remember or a note book etc.) aren't doable anymore because she can't focus.   
Food wise, my aunty's tried soft foods and smoothies, even sneaking supplements in, but they aren't really an option either. 

My family are trying their best with what they can do (especially with being in quarantine), but is there more we can be doing... or do we just keep doing what we're doing....?

Thank you for your time.","My mom lives with me, I’ve been dealing with the same issues for two years now. Sometimes she seems to realize there’s a problem with her mind, most of the time she has no idea and is just generally confused. 

Every case can be different, every personality is different- even when it comes to the people who care for the patient. My older brother for example- when he came to give me a break this past weekend, he left her in bed the whole weekend, and was surprised when she ended up staying awake all night. 

From my experience, the best you can do is be there to help give your aunt a break, and try to help her (and yourself) understand that sometimes there just is no easy way to deal with this. 

There’s no real point in arguing with someone who has Alzheimer’s, they have an entire world going in in their own mind, even if it makes no sense- it’s often way easier to just go along with what they’re saying and redirect the conversation. 

The stove- we shut off the gas to the stove a while ago, now we use a microwave for her meals. 

A helper might be a good idea for a few reasons- getting someone into your house who’s experienced with this kind of thing might also teach you and your aunt some things. 

In the end, all you can do is be there and do your best.
Go relieve your aunt for a few hours now and then. Turn on some music, bring some Ensure, bring a stuffed animal, bring some soft candy like Reese's. Take her for a short walk while holding her arm.",2021-10-07 02:55:33,Fujo_chan,q33e88
Alzheimers,New Phase 3 AD Trial Started,,Link isn't working. Anyone have a working link? Or at least a summary?,2021-10-06 11:23:59,Love-Will-Privail,q2mpwa
Alzheimers,Need urgent perspective on a dog situation.,"Hello everyone. I previously posted about my grandfather [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/o4ylse/how_do_we_take_the_dogs_away_xpost_from_rdementia/). Things have progressed and I'd very much appreciate some insight. My mother is POA and sort of the unofficial caregiver, but does not live with him.

First of all, shortly after that post, one of the dogs was put down. We are unsure exactly what happened, but she was throwing up and apparently miserable. I believe Papa was talking about ""putting her down"" like, ""in the backyard"" if you catch my drift. This was alarming. My mom convinced him to try a medication the vet had suggested. 

The short version of this story is that the dogs looked very similar and the wrong dog was getting the medication and therefore the sick dog did not improve and therefore got euthanized by the vet. To say I'm horrified about this is an understatement. 

The remaining dog (11 year old yellow lab) is overweight, arthritic, currently has a double ear infection, and recently sprained an elbow. Supposedly she fell off the bed. She is 110% not getting medicated for arthritis, nor is she getting the care she needs for her ears, because Papa does not remember to do this. 

He loves the dog. But also apparently is starting to forget he has a dog. I guess he asked my mom last night ""where did this dog come from?"". But also still thinks he has two dogs sometimes. His GP and Neurologist seem to think it's good for him to have the dog. Do they know about the state of the dog? I do not know.

Papa is moving in to an assisted living facility this month. My mom is trying to work in conversations about the dog coming to stay with me/my husband while he moves in and then hopefully he'll just forget about her. My mom is convinced this isn't going to work and Papa will get belligerent. I guess she's brought it up a couple times before and it hasn't gone over well...the general idea of the dog coming to live with me. 

Quite frankly I don't give a shit if he likes it or not. This dog is suffering and needs to be taken care of and no one is taking care of her. Papa is already forgetting her and how many dogs he does/does not have. I know the doctors think the dog is good for him, but it's not good for HER.

What can/should I do? From what I understand about Papa's condition, he's going to be angry about it but probably not remember it the next day anyway. Do we take the dog and all the dog stuff out of the apartment at the same time and then POOF! she's gone from his mind?","IF he asks: She's at the vet.  Needs to stay overnight for some tests, but she's fine.  She'll be home tomorrow.",2021-10-06 13:38:13,valdra,q2petp
Alzheimers,Is coffee advisable for later stages of Alzheimer's? A few more questions into this issue,"My mother is getting deeper into this illness (Stage 5 or 6) and starting to display a lot of restlessness, agitation, compulsions (OCD!), and anxiety.

She expresses these anguished sighs one might make when very overwhelmed or stressed.

Every morning she has a couple cups of coffee.

I understand caffeine is advisable early on but this late in the game, I'm wondering if it's just making her symptoms worse.

We're certainly not saving her memory or anything at this point with a couple cups of coffee.

My father, while the primary caretaker, is very stuck in his ways. When I asked him about why she needs coffee, he kind of shrugged like ""well, that's just what she's always done...""

**What do you think? Necessary? Good for morale? Better to switch to something less stimulating?**

**P.S.** I could go into the science and my concerns about coffee and cerebral blood flow, cortisol, etc. but I want to first suspend my judgement and get your very much appreciated opinion.","I'm of the mindset with my dad to just keep him happy with what time he has left. He loves sweets so we just let him have them.

I get where you're coming from with coffee though as it could be adding to her anxiety. Maybe ask your dad to switch her to decaf if you're worried? Just keep in mind it might not really change anything as a lot of what you're seeing from her is pretty normal at the stage she's in. We had to put my dad on an antipsychotic for mood swings (although he still hates his caregivers 😅).
Taking away something she loves could cause behaviors. I would do like the other posters have suggested and switch her to decaf.
There’s nothing you can do that’s gonna solve or help alzheimer’s sadly. It will continue whether the person does everything right or everything wrong.
My grandfather was a life long smoker. When he got into his 3-4 year of alz he started trying to light them backwards so my mom “took” them away. This caused weird behaviors and outbursts, including him taking off in the middle of the night.
Eventually the doctor was like..just let him smoke. He had healthy lungs despite his smoking, and it seemed to be one of the only habits which kept him somewhat attached to his reality. 
i would say it’s the same with coffee. you could try buying the same brand but in decaf and replacing it to see if that works. she likely won’t even notice :)
My dad is in a similar or more advanced stage. He loved coffee and always says yes to a cup of coffee. He had been complaining about his stomach and we thought it was the coffee in the mornings, so we switched him to chamomile tea. He didn’t notice, he does recognize when we don’t add sweetener. We just tell him, here is your coffee and he drinks it. In fact the other day I gave him some coffee and he didn’t liked much, it was too strong he said. The agitation and anxiety hasn’t been changed, it’s the same or more as that is caused by his inability to remember where he is. He still complainants about his stomach, but less. 

If she enjoys her coffee, keep giving her. As others have said give her decaf if you think caffeine it’s affecting her. Or if you take her out just don’t tell her it’s tea, all her life she has drink coffee.
We switched my LO from caffeinated to decaf years ago and it made her agitation less intense. Perhaps slowly make the transition, and see how she does.
Somebody in my caregiver support group reports that her husband, in memory care, is allowed one beer a day, even though it's not something they routinely have around there.  It's a cultural thing, like attending Mass every Sunday.  (Especially since beer is a big industry in our state.)

I'm thinking, if your mother wants her coffee, she should get it.  You aren't going to change her outcome any, just as a matter of the timeline.  You could see if she's content on decaf I suppose.  Also, don't have it be all day, just a cup or two in the morning, so it doesn't affect her sleep at night.",2021-10-06 14:45:02,alejandroclark,q2qq3u
Alzheimers,Assisted living?,"What is your experience dropping a family member off at assisted living? Do you lie to them? My dad will most likely be moving into a facility in the upcoming month and I'm not sure what to expect. I am sure it will be unpleasant as he almost threw a fit when he thought he would have an overnight stay in the hospital. 

&#x200B;

Although he is only 58 he is rapidly declining. He does know who is family members are, recognizes all of us when we come visit and is aware of where he is. However, he is in adult diapers and not aware when he goes to the bathroom, and often screams when it is a bowel movement and screams in the shower. He also will take the diaper off and go to the bathroom on the floor or couch and sit/lay in it. He has problems sitting up and back down as well as laying up and down and leans to one side when standing and falls often. That is why it has been hard to make the switch because although his body is declining, he still knows us and the house. 

&#x200B;

My mom is paying out of pocket for a caretaker when she is at work but I know she is up all night as he wakes up every half hour even with an increase in medication that is supposed to calm him and let him sleep. 

Also, do we bring furniture/items as if we are going to a dorm room? We thought we would tell him its like a rehab to make himself stronger and help physically. Not sure what to expect. Should we not visit right away? How long/often are your visits?","We moved Mum from independent living apartment into one room memory care. 

What was suggested to us, and we had enough people to do it, was to take Mum out to lunch, while several people moved essentials to her new room. Her bed, one overstuffed chair, a side table, a visitor's chair, a chest of drawers, dresser, clothes, photos on the wall, and personal items. When done with lunch, we were to take her for a pedicure. Well, after lunch, she was tired, and only wanted to go back and take a nap, so we took her ""home"" to her new room. 

She saw her stuff there and she was sort of okay with the new room. It was her bedspread, her clothes in the closet, her dresser. If she was confused, she didn't show it. She just kind of accepted it. There were some key elements that she knew were hers, plus, she was tired.

After a nap, she wanted to go to dinner with her friends in the independent living dining room, but I kept trying to explain that she had a new dining room with new friends. Well, it wasn't the same and she knew it. I finally just kind of looked at one of the nurses and shrugged. The nurse recognized my plea for help and she explained to Mum that the other dining room was being redecorated and Mum was to eat here for now. A lie, of course, but a white lie to help Mum cope. 

My advice is to ask questions and rely on the nurses. They've seen it all and want to help. Ask for help. They have the experience. When Mum was agitated about the dining room, the nurse let me do it my way, and only after I asked for help did she step in. If what I did had worked, great, but it didn't, so Plan B.

They told us that it would take a while for Mum to settle in, and it did. They didn't suggest how long it would take for the rest of us to accept our new reality. 

Take care of yourself.
Def sounds like he’s beyond assisted living and needs memory care.  Talk to your neurologist about changing meds before the move.  We refer to it as my moms new apartment, seems to help.  Yes, bring furniture he is familiar with to ease the transition. Visit often for memory care.  If it was assistant living, I would say give them a week on their own.
Is he going to assisted living or a nursing home? I am just wondering because if he is incontinent, cannot get up in his own, and falls easily he is most likely past the point of an assisted living.
I lied. I told my mom I'd found a new place for lunch. We went in, the director met us in the main lobby, which was a huge open space with murals, fish tanks, and tables/chairs. She showed us to the dining room, the conservatory, and led to my mom's suite where the chef was waiting. He had a plate of chocolate chip cookies and asked her if she'd like him to show her to the dining room. 

She was so entranced with the cookies, that she focused on those and didn't notice that we left. It took about six weeks, and she started settling in. Soon enough, I would stop to see her and she'd tell me she was happy to see me, but she had plans with her friends.

For the visits, they encouraged us to visit often. We'd usually come, walk to the neighboring hotel to eat in the tavern, and then walk her back. She loved the resort as they had goats you could visit. Getting her to go back inside was a challenge until I learned to hit the hotel's bakery first  I'd buy a few desserts she picked out that required refrigeration. She'd rush to get them back to her room before they started melting. 

The staff where my mom was staying said they were being paid to handle the hard stuff, so we shouldn't worry about them having to endure her mood swings. My mom's suite required us to furnish it in the first place. For the Medicaid places, they furnish them and told us pictures and personal items that are familiar to her would be appreciated.
It sounds like your dad needs more care than assisted living was designed for and might qualify for nursing home care instead.  My MIL was in assisted living until she became incontinent and required diapers that she would pull off and hide within the apartment she was in.  Her behavior also declined and because she required more care she was transferred to a nursing home.  When choosing a facility for your father, ask the staff for guidance on dropping him off in order to minimize the drama that can occur.  They have experience dealing with this scenario and can help the transition go more smoothly.  They will also make recommendations for which furniture and familiar items to bring for his room.  Sending you best wishes.
I just moved my Dad this past Friday from an independent senior living place to a memory care place.  I too moved a lot of his stuff before moving him.  I thought it would be harder than it was because he went from an apartment to a room and told me daily that he didn’t want to move.  In the end, he barely even noticed and keeps asking me when he’s moving.  He doesn’t realize that he already has (even though I’ve told him 2001 times).  He’s doing great now but is in a room that will eventually have another person in it which I think will be a problem.  My next step is to see if he qualifies for VA benefits that will help pay for the facility so I can get him in a private room before they get a new resident.
>  I am sure it will be unpleasant as he almost threw a fit when he thought he would have an overnight stay in the hospital.

Is he on any meds for his outbursts? Ask his doc about Seroquel or another med with anti-psychotic properties. It was helpful for my mother. Talk to his physician, and see if you can get him on that before doing the placement.

My mom had a hospital stay before I placed her. It was a useful transition. I was able to tell her that she had to go to rehab and get better. She forgets things on a daily basis, so it was a useful fiction.

From what you’re saying, I don’t think assisted living will be appropriate for him. Check on memory care facilities, but make sure they know about his emotional outbursts. My mom would occasionally swat or swing her hand at the aides when she was in the hospital. Many of the memory care facilities here considered that violent behavior, and wouldn’t accept her because of it. Make sure that the facilities you’re looking at can handle that type of behavior.

My state has advocates that can help with the search. They help you find the right facility, and then are paid by the facility once a relative is placed. Check around, and see if those are available in your area. It was a godsend to have someone who not only knew all of the local facilities, but had relationships with the staff there.
Your father is sundowning and it's one of the phases.   


IF you move to an assisted living some people do well but from the sounds of it the structure of the family home and your mother is what he's depending upon to maintain himself.  


You have to anticipate that having that removed and the adjustment might or might not be good for him.  I've seen people sink very quickly at the assisted living phase into full memory care.  When my father was in the facility, he became friends with a former high level (international brand and advisor to a US presidential admin)  and I saw him decline sharply.   


I was able to sit down and talk to him about business, government inner workings and some of the decisions he was involved in.   He couldn't describe things in detail but he lit up when there was a question that I phrased the right way and he could confirm with a ""YES!"" or a short statement. 

That's when he first went into the assisted living... a few months later he was full time in the lockdown memory care and needed assistance with everything.    
IF you ask me it was his structure he had with his wife that helped keep him afloat.   


That's why I moved my father to move and live with me.  
The family structure is something that they lean on heavily and it keeps them going.  


Now your mom can't be allowed to be brought down by the weight of this.  
She'll need a LOT of help and I strongly urge you to seek out whatever and every resource you can to help you with this.  


His sundowning will pass and it can be helped by setting the circadian rhythm by direct exposure to sunlight during the day.   I had to go through this with my dad, it's a hassle but they can't help it. (you just have to remember that)  


I strongly urge people to look into various cognitive enhancing supplements to help aid what is prescribed as well as nutrition.   **Those do make a difference and should not be expensive at all.**  


Vinpocetine + ginko biloba is one such combo that helped my father with his ""presence of mind""  and speech and is quite safe. 

(Check with your doctor before adding to their routine)   


But IME putting them into a facility at any point causes a serious decline and once a person is inside the system (USA) it's hard to get them out.   The entire industry is being bought up by corporate interests and NEEDS greater regulation.     


I'll be keeping my father with me till the end with hospice, he's not going back in there.",2021-10-05 08:35:11,rge703,q1vgpb
Alzheimers,What measures can I take to prevent Alzheimer's,"I'm only 40 but over the last couple years I've started to forget a lot of things. I can't recall movies I watched from 2 weeks ago (until I rewatch it and then it all comes back), I can't recall certain events in my 20s (like where I first met an ex-gf) and a lot of other things. However with numbers, especially telephone numbers or any set of numbers I can recall from way back in the past. 

Anyways I know this may be an early sign of potential Alzheimer's disease and want to know what I can do to slow down the process, if so. I have a pretty bad diet and don't really exercise much anymore. So I know I need to fix those things but are there any other pointers anyone can give me. I saw my grandmother go through a mild level of Alzheimer's where she would forget conversations from 5 mins ago and wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. 

So far I have mapped out a plan with the changes I need to make in my life

1. Eat better
2. Exercise
3. Do math equations to stimulate my brain

If anyone can add anything else, that would be much appreciated.","I too worry about this sometimes.  


Things i do:   


1. Brush teeth with non-dominant hand  

2. Take an active interest in learning: reading, and language study. Try it, learning a language for 6 months opens up a totally new world and will most definitely stimulate your mind  

3. Try to stay up to date with current events, if that interests you at all. Read the newspaper each day and do the crossword for half an hour.  


None of this is proven to help prevent it but it can't hurt, right?
Your list is a start, but it will need to evolve. 

Eat better, then eat less fat and more protein. Add more fiber, eat more raw veggies. 

Exercise needs to continuously get more challenging. Walk 8,000 steps, then 10,000, then 12,000 increase the pace of your walking. Get some weights and build muscle. Time to think cardio, jog or go treadmill. Bicycling is good exercise. Get a fitness tracker, and keep making goals. 

Study on line, master a new skill, take math to the next level- try programming
I'm a writer for the Alzheimer's Association, and preventive measures like these have been a huge part of research as of late. If you want to get a thorough list of specifics, look up the Finnish FINGER study and the U.S. POINTER study. While nothing is conclusive, the results of FINGER were so promising that POINTER was established to replicate it according to American lifestyles and learn even more.

The results from FINGER ""indicated that a multidomain intervention of physical activity, nutritional guidance, cognitive training, social activities, and management of heart health risk factors protected cognitive function in healthy older adults at increased risk of cognitive decline. As yet, there are no pharmacological treatment options that can rival this effect.""

POINTER is focusing not just on healthy eating but the Mediterranean diet in particular. Lowering blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar through diet and exercise is another important element. Any daily brain training is excellent - learn a new programming language, learn a foreign language through Duolingo, etc. Social interaction is very important as well.
MIND diet and walk 30-45 minutes daily.
I cannot speak to the effectiveness of this but witnessed someone slip into the late stages of Alzheimer's rather quickly after several decades of this one habit: heavy drinking.

It seems rather obvious to me that drinking 3-5 servings of a carcinogenic poison would eventually lead to brain damage but others are not so easily convinced (especially when the beverage industry would not like you to decrease your drinking habits).

One of the measures I've put into effect the last few years (after watching someone whom I love fade away) has been cutting out alcohol as much as possible.

A lot of people will talk about what you can DO but more needs to be said about what you should CUT OUT A.S.A.P.

I guess the question is, how deep do you want to go into preventing something like Alzheimer's? Luckily, the preventative measures ensure good health all around in the long-run anyway. You won't lose anything in the pursuit of prevention, IMO.
I don't have much problem with forgetfulness but am actively doing stuff to prevent the discease. Cutting sugars and fasting definitely help with my brain fog. As insulin competes the enzyme that untangle the Amyloid beta and tau, I think keeping insulin level low is helpful. I also do sauna and swimming, working on programming and learning piano are positive measures too. 
As Amyloid develops 20 years prior to discease, 50s is around the time to take prevention. You definitely on the right track
Have you considered talking to your doctor about this, to see if you can get esrly screening and to check for other issues that could cause similar symptoms?  The earlier you start the conversation, the earlier you can get direct and specific care if/when you need it.  Also by doing testing now it may help by recording s baseline to observe changes from.",2021-10-05 04:08:31,SprayinGunzAtNunz,q1rwon
Alzheimers,Recently moved mom to memory care - how do you know it’s “right”?,"Forgive me if I’m doing this all wrong, this is my first post in Reddit. I’m 41 years old and my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s (early stages) two years ago at age 74. She was relatively healthy otherwise. In the last couple of weeks she has had a sharp decline overall but still very high functioning. She was living with myself and my spouse and 6 year old daughter but she has a one track mind of getting back to her boyfriend in Canada. The boyfriend is not honest with her (they still speak on phone), but tells my siblings and I that he cannot take care of her. She blames us for keeping them apart, even though he isn’t allowed to come to US anyway due to Covid. Every day was arguments about pills and remembering to eat. She would get angry when we’d try to help her, claiming that us not letting her do these things herself is what’s making her “brain fail”.  Left to her own devices she is not capable of taking her pills appropriately or cooking a decent meal. She claimed she had all this money (she does not) and we must be stealing it. She would get verbal aggressive and the arguing started to have a real effect on my spouse and daughter (and me)!  We placed her in an “apartment style” AL that has a memory care neighborhood and she is irate. She claims she wants to die, she hates it, her life is over, we dumped her, and she’s refusing to take her pills now. I feel like I’m going crazy - the guilt and grief and sadness just never ends with this disease. She is truly high functioning for memory care but not appropriate for more independent assisted living or independent senior housing. So we are stuck in this cycle of her begging us to get her out so she can go be with her boyfriend in Canada, us gently trying to redirect, and her spitting venom at us again. It’s awful and heartbreaking. I guess maybe I’m just venting, or looking for reassurance or similar experiences? Thank you for listening and I’m sorry to all who love someone with this awful disease.","I'm sorry, OP. There's nothing worse. I try to just remind myself (in my situation) that my dad, in his right mind, would want me to put him in memory care and continue living my life. Hang in there.
I know this is hard to emotionally do, but try your best not to take whatever she says personally. It took me years to do that with my MIL. Hopefully (and usually) the new living situation at the memory care facility will become their new normal. Though I do have a friend whose mother was bitter and aware that she didn't want to be there until the end, even when she no longer remembered much of anything else. You did the best thing for everyone. Living with someone with memory loss is a danger to all involved. They can set the house on fire (my MIL put a roll in the microwave, set it on 9 hours and blew out the motor, caused a fire). They can poison themselves and pets, children, etc. because they don't remember what's correct to eat or drink. Please remember all of that if/when you have any doubt about your decision to move your mother. You did what is best for her and everyone. This disease is horrible and heartbreaking and cruel. You have my sympathy.
My mom was a bit further down the scale, I’m definitely not independent, but I had similar issues when I had to place her back in May. The first place was respite while we were arranging a permanent placement, and I had to tell her that she had been sick and was in rehabilitation until the doctor said it was OK to go home. She would forget this each time I visited her. Her permanent placement is nicer, but she’s degraded more rapidly than we planned on, though she still stable.

Give your mom time. It may take a few months for her to get used to the new routine, and trust the aides who are bringing her meds. He will probably make the adjustment.
You do what you have to do.  I hope that you become very involved with her care at the assisted living.  People who have close family involvement do much better than those who don't.
The thing I keep reminding myself is, I’m doing my best. Some days it’s not enough, but I know if my dad was still around or my mom was in her right mind, they’d both be proud. 

There isn’t a doctor in the world that can fix this thing- I’m definitely not a doctor, I don’t have a cure, so all I can do is my best. It sounds to me like you’re doing your best too. 

Cheers OP- this shit isn’t easy, but you can at least say you’re doing your best.
We just put dad (75) in memory care a month ago. Mom has struggled with guilt and letting go. It seemed like she was waiting for some really clear sign, an emergency or catastrophe, but to wait for that means you may not have many options on short notice. I feel relieved he’s in care, because mom isn’t young either, and has always had a difficult time being a full-time caregiver (I live far from them.)

Something the director told my mom is to take advantage of just being a spouse again. The staff will take care of the rest. She’s enjoying visits, taking him fun activities. It is a process letting go. You have to do what’s necessary to keep her safe and healthy, as well as protect yourself.
My mom and I were best friends for most of my life, so it hurt when I experienced things similar to you. I was the obstacle keeping her from going ""home."" I saw her clench her fists and prepare to hit me more than once, and she did push me out of the way and into walls several times. She also loved to tell me she hated me and wanted me to go away and never come back. Everyone says it's the disease, not her, and I get it, but that doesn't make it hurt less.

I hate to say, but for me, the best thing was moving her into a memory care community. It's allowed me to focus on myself for the first time in almost 30 years (about 15 being the stay/work-at-home mom to my kids and about 15 years caring for my parents). I know I'll feel guilty, but it's been better for my own mental and physical health having that much-needed break.
Pretty much my story too with the exception that my moms boyfriend is imaginary.  Call to the neurologist got her on some new anxiety meds and she has adjusted quite well to memory care.  She’s the highest functioning one there, gets bored a lot.  But, the vitriol is gone, the crying is gone and the constant “I want to die” has turned to more of an occasional “I’ve had a good life” speech
Hi, 

I (37F) know I'm late on this post, but I just wanted to share that I have a very similar situation with my Mom (71).  She is high functioning for MC, but we had to move her out of AL because she would try to leave all the time (not having any idea where she is or where she was going, often in a very heightened emotional state), and she refused to go to meals, participate in activities, or practice basic hygiene.  Add to it, my father passed away earlier this year, and she's been depressed ever since, frequent crying spells with threats of suicide,  and sometimes even forgets he has passed away. When she asks about him, we try to lie and redirect, but it never works. She just keeps asking and asking until she usually remembers herself. Somehow though, my mom has become a prolific texter in her declining dementia lol! So I get frequent vitriol texts, but honestly I'll take that over the days where I wake up to 18 missed calls from her. She says we dumped her and nobody wants her. Oh also, I never visit her (not true). I feel guilt a lot, too. We are all just doing the best we can with the resources we have. I hope it gets a little better for you.",2021-10-04 16:21:53,Hopeful-Meaning4999,q1e72e
Alzheimers,Dad has Lewy Body Dementia - recording videos and audio of his memories - help my figure out questions!!!,"Hello, 

My father was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia 6 years ago - and I have started coming to my parents house once every few months with microphones and audio recording devices - to make recordings of his memories (his old memories are razor sharp - his new ones dont really stick).  I wanted to make recordings for him - so he can listen to his own stories - and I will get people who are in his stories to record their side - so when he is in the throngs of dementia - he can listen to his own memories and stories.  This is also so my and my brothers children will be able to see videos of him and hear his stories.  

I'm here to ask - what kinds of questions would you want to ask your father?  What are somethings you wished you would be able to ask - or things you would be curious about?

Serious and Funny questions - Here are what I am asking/planning on asking 

1. What do you remember about becoming a father
2. What if anything was something you stole - how did you feel after that
3. What was it like meeting mom - and getting married / having kids?
4. What was it like growing up durring the segregation movement ending?
5. Who was your first kiss - 
6. What was the most scared you had ever been?
7. Did you ever want to leave after you started a family?
8. What was your favorite trip you have ever taken?
9. What was your favorite memory growing up?
10. How has love changed as you have gotten older?","What do you remember most about your parents? Your grandparents? 
What did your parents do?
What was favorite game or as toy as a child? 
What did you want to be growing up?
What makes you laugh?
Person that really impacted your life?
What message do you have for your family?
Barnes and Noble had some great “My Life Story” journals designed for grandparents, parents, etc with guided questions so the journal could be gifted. One of those may give you great ideas for questions. 

1. First date, where did you go, what did you wear, name of the movie
2. I like to ask about major historical things as they recall them - JFK, desegregation (asked my grandparents about that one), 
3. Maybe a casual AMA on Reddit could have folks coming up with questions that you wouldn’t have thought of!
Ask some questions about you, and his relationship with you.  What was his favourite memory with you,  etc.
What was your first car?

Where did you go on your first road trip?

What was your first job?
How has the world changed since you were a kid? 

What do you think about technology and how it's advanced? 

What was Christmas/Halloween/Thanksgiving like as a kid?

What sports did you play? Any fond memories of coaches/teammates/games?",2021-10-03 14:07:40,Assloadofdymes,q0n7p8
Alzheimers,Recruitment for Alzheimer’s Disease Caregiver Study,"\*\*We are so sorry for the repost but we need more participants for this study and we greatly appreciate those who already did the survey and discussion posts! Thank you so much again!

Hello, 

We are part of a research team at the Emory University School of Nursing. Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN, School of Nursing, Emory University, and her colleagues are conducting a study to explore racial/ethnic differences in the attitudes toward Alzheimer’s Disease among midlife women who are family caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer’s Disease.

Alzheimers,"Need support, dad was just diagnosed","My dad celebrated his 72nd birthday last week, and yesterday he was diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. This disease scares me more than any other because he can't really fight it. I'm scared and sad and mad and trying to figure out how to support my dad and mom when I live a fair distance away. I'm thankful my dad is very tech savvy so we can use different things to help him with his short term memory, but beyond that I don't know what to do. I just need some support so I can help my parents.","Take it one day at a time and just put out the fires as they pop up. It’s a long journey. Your parents are lucky to have your concern and support even if it is from a distance.
A second comment to say that thinking of outlets and support for your mother will be just as important. Being a caregiver for some becomes a bit of a prison depending on how the disease unravels. We made sure my grandmother had plenty to read and we played games with her via her phone. Texting was also huge as audible conversations started to make my grandfather paranoid. Gave her an outlet to talk about feelings and stay connected without him questioning everything.

This was prob one of the saddest  weeks of my life. I’m glad he’s not in any pain anymore, but I’m just sad that I will never see my dad again. It’s just not fair.","I’m sorry for your loss.
So sorry for your loss my friend
So sorry 💔
Words are never enough. But I hope you may find peace
Sending you hugs my friend. At least he is not suffering anymore. Try to focus on the happy times and be grateful you had such a great dad that meant a lot to you.   


Unfortunately, grief is the price we pay for love.
Lost my dad this week too.  Let me know if you want to commiserate.
So sorry.

Kinda going through the same thing. We lost my grandma last week. Just the whole thing is so tragic and unfair and thinking about how much the disease took from her is so infuriating.
I'm so sorry my friend. No matter how expected, losing a parent is always so difficult. It's okay to be sad, to cry, to get angry, to be relieved. No matter how you're feeling now it's normal and expected. Big hugs to you.
Im so sorry for your loss. Grief is the cost of love. I saw that somewhere and it gives me comfort.
I lost my dad in April and it still gets to me.  I thought I was prepared and ready for him to be out of misery, but I miss him horribly.
I’m so sorry. My mom has it but is doing well this week. I’m afraid of what’s to come
So sorry for your loss. It is hard to handle. Lost my mom to early onset alzheimers two weeks ago. This disease sucks.
Hang in there.  Lots of love from all of us.
I'm sorry for your loss. I know that losing your dad is hard. But I do know that this isn't a permanent goodbye. You'll be together again someday. The wait until then is just hard.
I’m so sorry 😢

Alzheimers,Complications from PEG feeding tube,"I was wondering if anyone has had their loved one recommended PEG feeding tube surgery? It’s for patients who can not eat or chew, and a tube is inserted surgically into the stomach where you pump liquid food into their stomach. My grandmother had this done because she couldn’t eat and her veins had a blockage due to having IV fluids pumped into her for a long time. (Her arms were purple from all the IV injections). She had the surgery done and was sent home. We then saw she had trouble breathing like there was fluid in her lungs. We took her to another hospital to get the fluid suctioned out but they said that it would come back again. She only survived a day or two after that.  I read an article somewhere that this PEG feeding tube surgery can cause fluid buildup in the lungs. And that’s exactly what happened to her. Does anyone have a similar experience?","I know it has been a while since you posted this, but in case anyone stumbles upon this thread in the future [here is some info](https://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/feeding-tubes-for-people-with-alzheimers/) regarding feeding tubes in patients with Alzheimer’s. I remember reading a booklet at the doctors office that echoed what that article states as well. Unfortunately it seems your experience was sort of par for the course :( sorry to hear about your grandma.",2021-10-02 17:12:37,thedowers,q03kek
Alzheimers,Who can I call to escort someone with Alzheimers wandering around home?,"I work at a local credit union.

A week ago an elderly lady came in who very clearly had some advanced alzheimers going on. Infact, once we found her record and account it was apperent that her son was the one who was supposed to be taking care of her. I was told after I was very patient with her. 

I had to explain things to her up to 10 times over, and she often ended up in a cycle of questions about things she'd already told me about. It was a very emotionally rough experience I'm not going to lie. It was about an hour I was with her too.

We attempted to contact her son using the information we had on file, but could not get ahold of him. This lady did mention something about how he was probably at work. And then later she'd ask if we could call him, when we said we couldn't get ahold of him she asked why, we'd say 'he's at work' and she'd wonder why he was at work. 

I was rather annoyed with her son actually for not taking care of his mother or ensuring she's safe. She eventually decided she would go home and wait for her son, after a couple times of walking out, then immediately turning back in and forgetting the whole interraction. Fortunately, it seems she lived just about a mile from the credit union and down the road, but I did not feel really too good about how that was how the interraction ended.

So in the future, in case she comes wandering in again, or if I have a different credit union member come in who's showing that they're not entirely with it, is there any sort of number or service we would be able to call to ensure they can safely get home? I did not feel comfortable at the end of the interraction that she ended up leaving, still alone, and I would've really wanted to just escort her myself but my work's policies (and the fact it was a saturday with reduced staff anyways) prevented me from doing so. 

I live in the Salt Lake region of Utah if that helps. I was thinking during the interraction of actually calling a paramedic or doctor of sorts. We also left a note on her account to tell her son to leave us some other family member numbers as well, but there's no gaurantee we will get any from him.","The police can give a person a ride home, if they are not busy with crime cases.  It's really not good to have a person with advanced dementia wandering around unattended.
Like other commenter, id say police is the best bet for you. It would hopefully free you up from any liabilities of getting a third party involved and maybe police can point the caregiver toward other resources. 

Otherwise theres govt services:
https://slco.org/aging-adult-services/information-assistance/
https://slco.org/aging-adult-services/caregiver-support/
No guarantee they can provide a body but they could maybe point you or caregiver in a good direction. 

Or nonprofits like aarp: https://local.aarp.org/volunteer-detail/senior-companion-volunteer-salt-lake-city-ut-146124.html

Sometimes church groups provide similar companion services for seniors regardless of denomination. 

Try to not be too hard on the son, if you are unfamiliar with their situation. It can get complicated, and thier options can be limited. 

You do seem like a compassionate individual tho. Maybe you or your bosses would feel like getting involved in your local Alzheimer's association or equivalent? https://www.alz.org/utah
If your workplace is inclined to get involved in community volunteering or sponsorship its an option.
u/smellygymbag u/UnsightlyFuzz

Thanks for the advice both of you, I figured calling an officer to help escort her home would be an option, I just was worried about the potential of such patients freaking out or that there may be other options with more specialized people.

Alzheimers,MIL lost her car today.,"My MIL (85F) has Alzheimer’s for a few years.  At first her symptoms were light but it’s progressing now.

Recently,  her doctor ordered a driving evaluation.  This week, we received the letter that she is no longer allowed to drive. 

So my husband and I went to her apartment to meet my MIL and my SIL (62F). The plan was to tell her that we are taking the car away.

So my SIL proceeded to tell her that she is no longer allowed to drive and that we are taking the car away.  She was shocked and almost started to cry.  Saying no more car,  no more car,  then she calmed down.

15 minutes later,  we proceeded to take the car keys.  She then asked why?  We explained again,  that she was no longer allowed to drive.  Once again,  she almost started to cry, repeating no more car,  no more car.

My SIL stayed with her when my husband left with the car.  She asked why he was taking her car?  SIL explained.  MIL had the same reaction, sadness and resolution.

It makes me so sad to see her stuck in this memory loop.  I needed to share.","She'll get used to it, or rather, forget she had a car.  

A car and the freedom it brings are so important to our society.  I will be sad when my time comes, too (though I hope to get ahead of it, for everybody's sake).  My DH still misses driving; for a few years he kept offering to run an errand for me in the car.
""Where's my car?""  
""\[Danny or whoever\] took your car to get it checked out. Something or other needs fixing. Hey, want some ice cream while we sit on the porch?"" 

We took this approach with my mom, and after a few weeks, IF she asked about the car (which she rarely did), we told her ""Danny"" discovered that the car had too many issues and couldn't be repaired. By then, though, she had grown used to being chaffaured to appointmeents and grocery shopping, etc., so she didn't seem as worried about losing her car.

Gently distract, deflect, & deceive with kindness -- since she won't remember the answer and probably cannot process the real meaning of it anyway, there's no need to  keep repeating the same bad news to her.  It's distressing each time.
It was more gradual for my mom. By the time I took her keys away, stealthily, she was aware on some level she shouldn’t be driving. She hardly took the car out during winter, and she hated cold weather, so it wasn’t hard to transition. 

You’ll need to find other ways to keep her connected with people. Make sure that it’s scheduled regularly. Also, expect the police to be called once or twice when she doesn’t see her car in the driveway.
My siblings and I talked about how to stop Mum from driving, and it's hard. Believe me, if she shouldn't be driving, it's is safer for her and everyone on the road to stop her. I personally took Mum's keys. I felt very bad, but it had to be done. 

A friend of mine forgot where he lived and drove 450+ miles from home before, thank goodness, they found him through a ""Senior alert.""",2021-10-02 16:41:23,KaleidoscopePure2250,q02zzh
Alzheimers,Scared to visit for the first time in over a year,"Tomorrow (or today depending on when you read this) will be the first time I’ve been able to see my grandma in over a year.

It’s been a long hard road with her dementia diagnosis and she’s finally settled and comfy in her LTC. Rules have eased up for visiting so it’s easier to go and see her.

I’m just feeling anxious because the last time I spoke to her on facetime which was sometime late last year she still remembered me. Tomorrow I know she won’t and I don’t know how to mentally prepare for that knife to my heart. 

In part I’m more worried about my grandad seeing my pain because I know he’s upset about me seeing her like this and not in her normal “grandma” way. I’m scared I’ll lose my composure but I also know I don’t want her there by herself with me too chicken to see her.

So if you have any kind words or pieces of advice, I’d deeply appreciate it.","Calmly introduce yourself as if meeting for the first time:

""Hello!  I'm Rachel, your son Jerry's daughter.  How are you today?""

Then you might need to repeat the introduction throughout the visit.

Even if she doesn't remember who you are, she can still appreciate a cheerful, friendly visitor.
Treat her with all the compassion and love you have while you are there. Then treat yourself with all that love and compassion once you're back home.
* Don't focus on yourself. Just talk to her like she is your grandma and knows who you are. If she asks who you are just tell her. I always tried to focus on my mother during our visits, does she seem content? well cared for? engaged? I preferred to assume ( as she seemed unaffected by a lot) that she was oblivious to her disease and that it was harder on me than her.
I've been there, twice. Its going to be hard. Part of me wants to say 'tough it out for your grandmother', but I barely lasted ten minutes with my grandmother the last time, so dont pay any attention to that.",2021-10-01 22:54:46,coastalkid92,pzmzyr
Alzheimers,Change,"Hi everyone, 

I’m 15 and my dad is 69, and recently he’s started to deteriorate, recently, he’s been confusing there and sometimes forgets where we are going, but there was one bad episode that was about 10 mins, he woke up and had no idea who I was, this was really a hit on me for a few days, but I got over it yet it still makes me cry. I am currently ok but this is slowly picking up and I am slowly losing my dad.. and this is so painful for me to watch it happen. He’s being moved to assisted living soon and this just pains more because despite his condition I think him going to assisted living is worse then his apartment currently because he will be around people in much worse condition. The point of this post is, does anybody have any coping methods? This so hard on me, luckily I’ve been able to manage it but with things slowly getting worse I need more help.. 
thank you.","Really sorry you’re going through this - it really sucks. Assisted living will probably give him a chance to have more socialization which is really great and important for Alzheimer’s patients. 

As for coping, I really recommend looking into therapy. This isn’t something you should handle by yourself and a therapist was really a godsend for me. I pretty much felt every emotion under the sun and thought I was handling it fine. Eventually though I snapped and got a therapist that same day. I wish I had reached out for help sooner.
You are very well 'spoken' for that tender age..my heart goes out to you..there is help available, see others comments..my advise is...just remember he loves you..he is NOT the person you 'knew' ""yesterday""..he cannot help it..remember the good times..do NOT take whatever he says or does personally!!!!!
After about a yr my mother finally 'settled in' at the assisted living facility..it was NOT a fun process,  but she did calm down.
I wish you the BEST of luck sweetheart. Just remember, they cannot help what they say..
My heart breaks for you. 15 is not the age to have to deal with this! First, I may be able to reassure you. In assisted living, your dad may be better than others, but he may find it better than living alone. 

My mom had a shrinking social circle after she retired. She took to staying home and puttering around the house all day as she was never great with directions and struggled to get to stores and area attractions without someone else driving or guiding her. She reached a point where she was forgetting where she lived and couldn't cook by herself without setting something on fire. In assisted living, she suddenly made friends and was far more active than she'd been. One day, I visited her and she told me she loved seeing me, but she had plans with her friends and did I mind if she left. It warmed my heart to see her happy and engaging with others her age.

As for coping, have you looked into exercises? After my mom was finally settled in memory care and pressure was off me, I started catching up on basic things I'd been putting off. Such as seeing my doctor for a yearly check-up. I was five years behind. My doctor found I was extremely anemic (still trying to find out why), and suggested that I start making other improvements like improve my diet and exercise more. I always go for a two-mile walk each day, but I wasn't eating as well as I should. I was told to pair walks with other exercise programs. What I've learned is that kickboxing, pilates, and tabata delight me. I get rid of so much stress with those programs.
Your school counseling team or a local minister will likely have some good resources for you. Other adults in your life (perhaps your mom, grandparents, etc.) may also be having a hard time with this. If they begin to lean on or confide in you, encourage them to find other forms of counseling and other adults to help them.
Talk about it to anyone your comfortable with, it's so helpful. I also try to focus on any humor that comes up, even the little things.
I lost my mom a year ago, finally. I can’t recall when I started to lose her it is such a long process. One thing that helped me cope with her forgetting me was to focus on her, how she was doing. I chose to be grateful that she was not aware (although how would we even know) that she had forgotten me and that if her days were simple and she seemed content that was good enough for me. I’m so sorry you are going through this at such a young age. One advantage I hope you have is that with everyone having cell phones worth cameras that you will have many pictures and videos. Keep taking them.
Hi, I was also 14/15 y/o when my dad was diagnosed, and my dad was also in his 60s, so I know how you feel.  But we lived in a house that we could put a fence around so we kept him at home, so our situations are a little different. In both our cases its a crappy time.

It sounds like you care a lot for your dad, and worry about him, so I am guessing he cares a lot about you and wants whats best for you. Probably the best thing you can do is to try to do your best in life. Like in school and college (if thats your plan), and be the best person you can manage to be as an adult. Don't let his Alzheimer's squish your chances at happiness.

When I was your age in that situation I kept thinking that I had to take care of him, because he took care of me, but now he's the sick one. But as I got older I realized that to him, his main job was to take care of me. And what he'd want most is to be proud of me. So by doing your best to be the best you, is how you can sort of ""take care of him,"" in your own way. 

Your dad may have a primary caretaker. Maybe your mom or some other relative? That person would have had a hard time taking care of him. Maybe they feel guilty for being the person who decided to put him in a home. You can support each other by talking to each other, checking in, seeing if the other needs help with something. Since your dad will be in an assisted living, it might not be day to day stress, but it will still be there. You can support each other. If they seem overwhelmed, or like they don't know how to get help, you could start looking into state and county offices on aging, elderly, or dementia care. You could also find out if theres an aarp or Alzheimer's association or equivalent near you. See if they have classes or groups that can help. 

When they go to assisted living, they will have a hard time at first, but a lot of this will be because its some place new, so they will be a bit more disoriented. I don't know as much about it, but I understand there is an adjustment period and then they might even out. 

Right now, I also suggest you take pictures, and even video if you can. I didn't think of this when I was your age. But I know I wished I had, and I regret not doing it, while they are still able to talk in complete sentences. Its easy to overlook until its too late. If you can, spend some quality time with them, playing cards, going for walks, or doing whatever with them that they like to do. And grab some pics or video while you're at it. 

I also wish I asked my dad more questions while I was able. Stuff that only he would know or care about. Maybe about his life before he met mom. Like what he was like in school. Howd he decide to do whatever he did for a living. What was he doing when some historical event happened in his past. If he's a veteran id ask him about that too (being a vet opens up other sets of benefits he may have btw). Id ask about his pets. His siblings when they were kids. I'd also ask him about advice or predictions. Like what kind of significant other he thinks id end up with. Anything you're worried about for the future. Whatever sage old man advice he's got. 

One of the things you should definitely ask about is what music they liked, esp from their 30s and younger, with focus on teens and 20s. Then, you can make a playlist for them and put it on mp3 or cd, for them to take to long term care. Id keep an extra copy in case it gets lost. If they get to a stage where they become difficult because of their mood, a lot of times music can help them, and can even help staff to manage them. 

Do try to find someone like a counsellor to talk to if you need. You can try to talk to friends, but in my experience, its a little hard for people who are not going through the same thing to understand, and this will be especially true when everybody's young and just trying to do high school things. If you try, and they don't get it, or seem a little insensitive, id try to forgive them. (I tried talking to high school friends about it once and it was awkward at best)

Thats all I can think of. I know its hard, really. I have absolutely been there. If you want to chat more in DM, feel free. In any case, good luck.
I'm so sorry about your dad and that you're having to deal with this, especially at your age. I have kids around your age and I know how hard it's been for them to handle my mother's situation.  (She has late-stage Alzheimer's.)  It's a terrible disease because it robs us of our family members in a slow, terrible way that occasionally gives us hope when the person is having a good day.  I know a lot of people have received some great support from the Alzheimer's Association.  The people there ""get it"" and know what you're going through.  They have lots of resources, information, and support.  Please consider reaching out to them.  It's always good to know you're not alone.  I'm wishing you the very best.

Edited to add:  Your dad probably will, at some point, say some awful things to you.  As hard as it is, you have to realize that it's not really \*him\* saying those things.  It's the disease.  For me, when my mother is saying something cruel, I've found that it works best to say something like ""ok, all right.""  You can't respond back like you would to someone who didn't have Alzheimer's.  It just doesn't work.",2021-10-01 01:06:51,Consistent_Art_8598,pz13ot

Since his diagnosis, he has been living at home with my family and I and care taking hasn't been so bad. In the last couple of days he has become suddenly violent, with the rest of my family and I being afraid for our safety. Because we did not complete his power of attorney documents, no facility that can better deal with his aggression will hold him involuntarily. I know that going through the process of getting power of attorney over someone in his state may take time, but I wonder if there is a speedier process for my emergency since we are afraid for our safety if he comes home from the emergency room today. (context I live in Virginia)","Yes, it’s called emergency surrogacy and you can get it at the emergency room from two doctors who independently assess your father. If you’ve seen a swift change in condition and behavior, you should take him to the ER and tell them what is going on, and ask for him to be tested for a urinary tract infection. Then ask for surrogacy. Most hospitals will have social workers that can explain the process abs help you get the forms. You might need to seek legal guardianship later, which involves going to court, but for the mean time you need to keep your family and your dad safe and seek medical attention.

Alzheimers,First Signs?,"My father (80) has Alzheimer’s and his side of the family has a history of dementia.  Looking back it was probably Alzheimer’s. 

Today I just had the biggest space cadet moment I’ve ever had in my life and to be honest, I’m a little concerned that this may be the first sign of Alzheimer’s for me.

I just walked into the restroom at work with my mind preoccupied with some serious work challenges and I walked up to and started peeing in the trash can.  It only lasted for .5 seconds.  When I heard the sound I clicked immediately back into reality and stopped.  I’m not on any medication or other substance that would impair my thinking or judgment.

Perhaps this was just a stress fugue and spending time with my father is making me paranoid, but how can you really tell?  I’m only 48.

Edit: typo","That was a brain fart. It happens to everybody, especially when under stress. You go on automatic, but your brain responds to Cue A the way it's supposed to respond to Cue B. 

There's an old line about dementia: it's not when you forget where you left your car keys, it's when you don't know what car keys are for. Being so stressed that you mistakenly pissed in a trash can instead of a toilet: not dementia. Not understanding the difference between a toilet and a trash can: dementia.
At 48, that would be early Alz, which is often hereditary. Reg Alz usually starts later and is an unclear mix of genes, environment, and lifestyle. Early Alz runs in my family and I thought I was gonna get it for decades. My sis, mother, and grandfather started showing signs in their 30s. I’ve had maaaaany space cadet moments. Most under stress. But I’m 57 and home free. No Alz genes.

Alzheimers,Hernia surgery effects on Alzheimer's patient,"Does anyone have an opinion/experience with a loved one who has Alzheimer's/dementia having surgery? Concerned about cognitive decline post op. Dad needs surgery on 2 hernias. Worried about the anesthesia, etc. It is to be done as an outpatient, and he will be under about an hour. Thanks!","Anesthesia GREATLY affected my father and resulted in quite a drastic decline in cognition. Do it only if it is absolutely necessary
Unless it is a medical emergency, I would recommend against it.  General anesthesia in the elderly can have a negative impact on cognition, especially if dementia is already an issue.  My dad underwent general anesthesia for a procedure that resulted in a significant drop in his cognitive function that he never recovered.  My father-in-law was in his 80’s when he underwent hernia surgery and that started his physical and cognitive decline.  It wasn’t imperative that he have the surgery but he was tired of wearing a truss.  General anesthesia in the elderly should be avoided if possible.
My mom just had surgery today.  She was under for about 45 minutes.  No difference seen from before surgery, but she is also not advanced ALZ, still early onset.
Thanks for your response. My dad is somewhere in the middle. Speedy recovery to your mom.
My mom had several surgeries on her hips/legs in the 7 years leading up to her diagnosis. There is a debatable link between being anesthetized and dementia, depending on what you read. 
My doctor said surgery/anesthesia isn't recommended after 50 unless it's really necessary. If your dad has hernias you can't leave him in agony, so I would say those are necessary.
DH had arthritis surgery on the thumb joint.  He has been in decline, including before the surgery.  For three-to-five days after surgery, he seemed more out of it than usual.  I will ask for lowest effective dose if he has the other thumb done.   However, he is having good pain relief so maybe it was worth the cognitive decline?  Whenever I give him a narcotic pill, I give him only half the stated dose.
You are most wise to be concerned. If you and he are willing, see if you can find a physician trained in the Bredesen protocol (based upon three recent books by Dale Bredesen, MD, titled The End of Alzheimer’s); or, you can visit their website at Apollo Health. Here is their provider list: https://www.apollohealthco.com/practitioner-locator/

My mom was diagnosed with Alz a few weeks ago and (based upon her genetic test) she has been advised by her doctor NEVER to get anesthesia with cholenesterase as we have seen this exacerbate her memory loss symptoms a few years ago before we knew her genetic test results. I also blog about these topics at own website: https://www.buffyslaysdementia.com
Appreciate hearing your experience and opinion. As much as I'd like for him to wait it out, you're right. He is in pain. I think the pain is making his dementia symptoms worse to an extent, too. It's kind of a lose/lose situation.",2021-09-28 10:50:01,Secure_Ant_856,px81b9
Alzheimers,How do you know?,"When it's time to transition your loved one to a memory care facility?

Someone who is very well aware of their deficiencies?","We were not equipped to help them anymore. She was either going to hurt herself, hurt us, and quite frankly we were on the brink of snapping
Although every individual situation is different, for my dad it was when he woke up in the middle of the night to pee when he collapsed into mom’s arms in the middle of their bedroom. His brain just forgot how to walk and never did again after that moment.

Would recommend having your loved one evaluated by hospice ASAP (even if you think it’s too soon) since their staff MD can tell you if your loved one is within 18 months or less of dying in order to qualify for hospice (which may vary in some states but this is Texas timeframe). 

Turns out that when dad collapsed, he was also dying and he died peacefully at a nursing home (with hospice help) about 10 months later from confirmed Alz. They kept him on liquid morphine every four hours once he could no longer swallow and it was the most merciful and compassionate end we could have given him under the circumstances. Hospice is also a wonderful way to help ensure more consistent care since memory care facilities are always understaffed and underpaid for the excruciating work they do for multiple clients 24/7.
When caring for them at home is no longer feasible. Care homes should have a 24/7 staff with experience and specialists. They will allow you to revert back to being there for your loved one on a family sense, instead of a caregiving sense. 

You are not giving up on them, you are upgrading the level of care they receive. If you could easily keep them at home you probably would. It's incredibly hard, but you are doing it for them, even if they can't see that.
My dad died unexpectedly, leaving my mom alone all day and night. I live 40 minutes from her. We are too young to retire, and we learned our dad had taken out a reverse mortgage. After his death, the pension he was bringing in was cut in half, so my mom's income drastically changed. I'd been a stay-at-home mom for 20 years, working from home as a freelancer to bring in income, and had just returned to an outside job. Someone had to be with my mom all day, so it was decided I was in the best position to quit and go back to freelancing.

But, that meant driving my husband to work, getting to my mom's before she woke up, cooking meals, cleaning up her house and doing her laundry, working as best I could with her always wanting to walk her dogs, picking up my husband when his day ended, walking my dog, and getting housework done. It was exhausting.

After a year of that, she no longer recognized her house. We installed cameras and got her a medic alert system at her doctor's recommendation, and we watched her go outside to walk her dogs at 1 a.m. She kept throwing out the bracelets or pendants. We decided at that point that we couldn't leave her alone. There was no money for home care services, and she clearly needed someone there when I wasn't. The cost of that care plus the equity she was losing each money with the reverse mortgage was equal to the cost of assisted living. The first place was a poor match to her needs, but the second place was fantastic. She made friends and had more fun than we'd seen her have in years.
Hello folks..new here, not new to dealing with 'it'..imma keep it short as possible..I tell stories in HD..(there's a sign.) lol..i took my mother OUT of a facility (been there a yr +) because I felt so friggen bad..then there was (we got this and its gonna be SO less expensive) we were also being threatened by the 'facility' with the they cant control her issue(dooly noted n understood)..I hate to say it like this..27 hours and after that woman tried to just then KICK out our storm glass DOOR I had her BACK at the facility..lol..in the middle of a tropical storm..It was a sleepless 27 hrs as well. All the time demanding to get BACK to '#$^blah bla'(new boyfriend in the facility)...but '#$^blah bla' is MY F'n name..lol..when 'they become a threat or danger to themselves or someone else' may be a bit to late some times. I finally got mom 'secured'..she had been doing a LOT of traveling back n forth to Wally World..money issues that sort of thing. So..... yeah...if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask..I HAVE seen it all..she was the youngest of 6..they ALL had us their mother..

Alzheimers,How do you take care of someone that has dementia and is sick all the time,"My mother is 75 and has dementia.  She is literally sick nearly every day.  She had a heart transplant, kidney disease, osteoperosis, and several other health issues.  She can not manage anything anymore - meds, doctor calls, appts, etc.

I need to be with her at every doctors appt as she can not remember anything or even tell the doctor what is wrong if she is sick.

I feel like there is no solution.  Having a ""nurse"" come in during the day does not help.","Hello u/sportsguyred

Am sorry that you are struggling to know how to help your mom. Dementia is a monster.

There could be several options to consider for her depending upon available resources in y’alls area. Also, the answer will depend upon her financial situation (and yours).

First, please never think that you must do all this on your own. 

The best move you can make right now (before doing anything else) is to hire a board certified estate planning attorney in your area (even if you or she has no money). Let me explain. The reason it’s so critical to do this step is:

1. Your mom is likely not (legally) able to express her needs to you. Without legal Power of Attorney for her it will be damn near impossible to make any legal or financial decisions on her behalf. 

2. You need an attorney’s help to legally protect her (and you). It’s surprisingly not enough that she’s your mom; and, life gets even more complicated if there’s anyone else in your family who could claim to be her legal guardian (even if untrue).

3. Whether she has a will (or not) then you will still need an attorney to see if she may qualify for Medicaid. Since this application process is complex, then you can pay the attorney to do this for you!

Also, if you gather all required documents for the attorney (or law firm) then they will likely be willing to charge you a flat fee (rather than by the hour if they do the work for you). Ask this up front and get it in writing if they will do this for you.

4. The attorney can also advise you on how best to legally manage her finances since she cannot.

In Texas, we paid about $1,600 to the attorney who handled the entire Medicaid process and death certification from start to finish for my dad who died from Alz in 2017; however, he already had a will and am not sure what the attorney will advise you if she does not.

Once the attorney is hired, see if there may be a Nurse Case Manager (RN or higher license) who will come to her house and conduct a medical evaluation of her condition. This will protect you both in the event she needs to go to the hospital and you need a medical pro in your corner to help explain her condition. They cost about $125 an hour but remember you will likely only need their services for a couple hours for the initial evaluation and then you may (or may not) ever need their service again but you’ll still have their number which can be invaluable!

Also, if you live in a small town and quality home care is not an option; or, if selections are limited elsewhere (for example, an area agency on aging with elder care resources) then it’s all the more reason to seek the attorney to think about next steps to get your mom to either an assisted living center or nursing home.

One final recommendation is to have her evaluated by the local hospice medical doctor. This won’t cost much and, if the doctor thinks she qualifies for hospice, then this can give her additional care at little or no cost to you.

Sending all compassion and kindness to you both. Please know that you can do this from an only child with both parents having Alz (along with four other relatives). Don’t give up! Just take things moment to moment and be good to yourself and her by gathering your help team of licensed professionals so you can get much needed breaks!
So sorry you’re dealing with this- 

I’m in the same situation, my mom can’t answer questions, and isn’t mobile at all- it’s extremely overwhelming, the responsibility feels unbearable sometimes. 

Here’s what helps me when the walls are closing in- I tell myself that I’m not a doctor, there is no way that even the best doctors can cure this- so all I can do is my best. 

Keep her safe and comfortable, and keep her company- these are the only things you can do. There are times I can’t physically get my mom down the stairs to get to her appointments- but I do my best, and I know she’d be real proud of me if she still had her reasoning. 

Be proud of yourself too- it can be a thankless job, so give yourself credit for all you’re doing. 

Also- credit to “nurses”- not sure what you’re dealing with on that front, but even having someone around to give me some sort of break is something I’m thankful for.",2021-09-27 17:42:56,sportsguyred,pwrd3y
Alzheimers,Controlling landline phone usage with passcode?,"Hi there,

Is there some way to set a password / PIN for placing outgoing calls on a landline phone?  My brother compulsively calls strangers to ask them very personal and invasive questions.  I've been trying many different solutions to mitigate this behavior, but nothing has worked and now I just want to have the phone locked down.

(It is important that incoming and outgoing calls be totally unrestricted for those with the password.  That rules out services like ""TeleCalm"", which only allow filtering specific numbers.)

Thanks!","We had a different problem. My mom couldn't use a phone to dial numbers, so if there was something wrong in the early stages, she didn't know how to reach one of us. We looked into a phone like this so that my mom could call people correctly. There were no numbers, which made it easier for her. Maybe it could help the random calls in your situation if you put in photos and used white paint or nail polish to cover the numbers under the pictures?

https://www.amazon.com/Future-Call-Picture-Speakerphone-FC-1007SP/dp/B01JZYSK0S
They make landlines phones that only are able to accept incoming calls with no ability to dial out.

Alzheimers,I'm too young to have to deal with all this shit,"This will probably not be a very well structured rant but I don't have anyone else to ask for advice/anyone at all who supports or understands me regarding this matter.

Im 19 years old, my mom has been atruggling with Early Onset since I was 12. The progress was relatively slow but still drastic. Since my early teenage years I've been watching my energetic, social, charismatic and loving mom turn into someone who projected their whole anger about her illness on me. For a few years we would do nothing but fight.
I was already prone to depression and selfharm, this ony made my relationship to my parents worse. They were so busy worrying about my mom that they would completely forget about me. I was very lonely from around 13-16, with barely any friends and no emotional support whatsoever. My social skills improved with a lot of therapy (that I organised myself at 15) but that constant empty feeling and the inability to form close connections stayed.

I'm not feeling well as is. But the worst thing is, I feel so alone. Even though I have great friends now and a good therapist. They just don't understand. They can't help.

By now, my mom needs help with everything. From getting dressed in the morning, to putting lotion on her dry skin (which is gross and I hate it) to making every single meal for her to having to listen and accomodate to her constant nagging and little problems daily. Barely getting any sleep because she can't keep the rooms apart at night when she wanders and being woken up in the middle of the night by her just blasting into my room and starting to talk. My dad has it worse, he gets even less sleep because they have to share a bed. We don't have that much space.

I've asked my dad for over a year now for some help for my mom, just like a daycare or something like that and he just yelled at me for ""wanting to deport my own mother to some home"" and brushed it off. I graduated highschool this year so my head wasn't in a place where i could organise something like that for my mom, too. I'm just so exhausted all the time. And so is he. Lately my dad has been leaving me alone with her for days at a time like once a month. That worked out fine until a year ago but now i'd have to stay home 24/7 for her. She cries when I leave only for a few hours to meet my friends. Sometimes my dad starts to binge drink and is not able to care for her anymore. This always lasts a few days too but lately it has happened more often. I told him specifically how shitty his behavior makes me feel but he will just agree and then not change anyway.

He has been physically abusive in the past and frankly I don't like either of my parents. I would be a lot happier without them in my life, but they are both so dependent on me and I feel so sorry for them. My mom can't help being ill and my dad lost the love of his life, his wife of over 20 years. I understand the, but I hate them. And I don't know what to do anymore. I try to move out but I just can't afford it right now and I'm so scared of leaving them alone.

What if my dad starts to drink again, but this time, never stops because I'm not there to guiltrip him into stopping? My mom will be even sadder all the time because she won't understand that I'm a grown up now and I need to move out. They fucked my life over and I feel so bitter about the version of myself I would've become if Alzheimer had never affected my mom. Now, everyone in my home is just incredibely depressed and uncontent with their life. Family and former family friends all ditched us the second my mom's illness got serious...","Okay, you realize that you need help not just for yourself but also for your parents.   
I'll offer some advice and support.  


>*""I'm not feeling well as is. But the worst thing is, I feel so alone. Even though I have great friends now and a good therapist. They just don't understand. They can't help.""*

You already have sought out help with that and that's good.   
It shows how capable you are and aware of your situation.   


Under normal circumstances, a lot of what you described there is very common, I had those same issues growing up even though I was very popular in highschool I also felt VERY alone, very often and went through bouts of depression.   That's pretty common for many reasons.  


But here's the good part.

it's all about your own perceptions and how you process things.  That's the trick right there it's under your control to how process things and react.   It's taken me a lot of work to start seeing the glass half full and I had to make those changes as a matter of survival. You can do that as well.   It's about choice and making choices vs *letting things happen to you.*  


I'm dealing with a lot of severe losses and trials int he last few years and I'm caring for my advanced alzheimers,  bed ridden father right now.   It's a lot easier to deal with it all if you take it in small steps and realize your are in control.  


So, [in my state we have some programs](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/in-home-supportive-services) available that you can apply for and that a caregiver such as yourself (because that's what you're describing)  can get paid by the government.    
What I suggest is that you  research this, dig into it and then when your ready present it to your father as an idea.     
This way you can get someone to help and or you can get paid for doing the things you're already doing daily for them.

Check in your own country/state and see if there's something like that available as well.   


regarding your friends and such,... I get it.  
People don' know how to react and it's difficult so they distance themselves.   
All my parents friends vaporized with my fathers disease... it's very common.  


Don't worry because that's transient and frankly speaking you'll emerge from all of this a lot stronger and better than they will be going into the future.    


Regarding your father.  
IF he's taking off for a few days, then he's got a issue.  
It's not right that he's burdened you like this and you're doing a very noble thing with helping your mother and him at this time.   I know it's hard... but it's also something that can be changed too.

So what I'd recommend is that working via negative energy to ""guilt trip"" your dad isn't going to work long term... it's going to make things worse.   They drink to escape from such feelings and troubles, you'll have to change tactics and get your dad pointed in another direction.   Ask your therapist for help and suggestions.... certainly you can get a group therapy thing started with you two.     The drinking is a symptom of the situation and  a poor coping mechanism, all of that can be changed I'm not a big fan of pills but you might ask if he could get a a short term antidepressant of some sort, nothing wrong with it, we can all agree that losing a wife like this is very difficult and depressing.   Either way, he's got to learn to not drink like that.

Also, your mother might be able to be put on something that will ease her symptoms of frustration and anger.  That will improve the home situation a lot from the sounds of it.  (it's a very difficult phase of the disease)  Contact her physicians and see if she can get prescribed something.    


I think that should be your first move to help correct things.  


The government stuff will likely take a month or two for the paperwork but you can get started on keeping people from bottoming out.  Seek out an agency and get some advice from someone as to what programs and services you might be able to access for yourself.   


That should help a lot... this disease is TRAGIC and DEVASTATING and so there's lots of help out there, you just need to access it.  I doubt that your father even knows that this stuff exists as he's got the wrong impression there... there's a lot of steps and things to do before you get to that   


Then you'll be able to work on other things   


*Just remember, one step at a time.*
I agree with much of the good advice here. My heart goes out to you. My mother had early onset when I was very young. I did not have to care for her, but my growing up was the worst and I was never close with my parents. I left at 18 and never returned. I visited. Although my life was brutal and sometimes still is because of my growing-up years, I have created my own personality and likes and family and friends and interests and am happy. I persevered. I do whatever I need to do to be mentally balanced and happy. I’m 57 now and loving life. I have my own family, and we are, for the most part, very close. I have tried to be to my children the mother I always wanted. My sister has early Alz. Like my mom, she began to exhibit strange behavior in her 30s. She is 64, and, I believe, In the final stage. I don’t live with her but do what I can, keeping in touch with texts, FaceTime, visits, meals.  Alz has been in my life for decades. 
This is kind-of a ramble, but I hope you work very hard to make a good life for yourself. I guess my advice would be to get your life situated - school, job, place to live, etc. One step at a time. Take care of yourself first. Prob sounds selfish, but that’s how I feel.
I just want to start by saying how awfully sorry I am for your circumstances. It truly breaks my heart to read your story and see that you have been robbed of your teenage years and your happiness. Your mother sounds like a beautiful person outside of the disease and it is so sad to how they become a former shell of themselves; I know this because I have experienced it personally. 

My first and foremost thought that I REALLY want to drive home to you is that caring for your mother and trying to control your dads choices (drinking) is absolutely NOT your job, nor is it in your control. You are now an adult and you have been taking care of your parents long enough, it is time to set yourself free and take back control of your life and do what is absolutely best for YOU. It’s all about boundaries and everyone has the perfect right to healthy boundaries and it sounds like yours have been eroded thanks to your circumstances and the responsibility that has been placed on your for so many years now. 

I understand you must feel terrified of the risks of what could happen if you are not around, but your dad has made the conscious decision to not put your mother in a care home, so as much as I hate to say it, your mother is your dad’s responsibility, as they made a vow to each other “through sickness and in health”. I wouldn’t be surprised if he might make the choice to drink less if you do so choose to leave because he might realize the reality of the situation and know that he longer has the luxury to drink as he wishes because he will no longer have the ability to pass the responsibility of caring for your mother onto you. 

It sounds to me like he relies on you a LOT to take care of your mother and I believe in turn, this gives him the freedom to disappear for days at a time and binge drink, but would he continue these such behaviours if you were not around? I would imagine he wouldn’t, although of course I do not know him or know his capabilities nor intentions. I would like to think though that he would have enough wits about him to be an actual adult and realize that he is the adult in this group and he has a responsibility. 

Again, it is his choice to not put her in a home and especially with that being said, it is NOT your job to care for your mother in lieu of her not being in extended care. You are not qualified, nor obligated to stay. 

If you are able to move out on your own, I would highly encourage it. It will be very tough to separate yourself from the dynamic but you MUST put yourself first for once. You deserve to be happy and although there may be hiccups in the beginning, your older self will thank you in the end. And even if things do go awry if you do move out, it is NOT on you!! You were not put on this earth to be your mother’s keeper, or your dad’s when you are so young and have been robbed of the opportunity to be your own person and do what makes you happy. 

In my own situation, I help care for both my in laws who both have Alzheimer’s, but I have also moved my life and have not been held “hostage” to care for them as you have. You deserve of live your life. Helping care for them should always be a choice, and not an obligation. 

I’m sending you so much love and my sincerest condolences for your situation. I know how awful this disease can be for everyone involved, it is truly challenging at the best of times to deal with. It’s time to put yourself first and do YOU!!! Best of luck to you and your family. ❤️
What country? It will help people help you if we know where you are.
Idk if this is what you needed to hear, but make sure the food you prepare her is as low as possible in processed fats, specifically fried food. While saturated fats might not be better for your heart it you live a sedentary lifestyle, but they are much better for your brain in terms of the oxidation most unsaturated fats go through. Idk how common knowledge it is, but an extremely strong link between processed fats and Alzheimer's has been made that 95% of the population is genetically at risk to.
I can relate and empathize with you. It's challenging to take care of family members who have medical issues that make them dependent on you.

Check with your insurance if it covers home health care giver services (they send someone to your home to help take care of your Mom).  She may need to be included as a dependent on the insurance plan in order to get coverage. It sounds like your mother qualifies for it since she is dependent on other people and cannot take care of herself completely. If you are in the US, check if your Mom qualifies for Medicare: [https://www.hhs.gov/answers/medicare-and-medicaid/who-is-elibible-for-medicare/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/medicare-and-medicaid/who-is-elibible-for-medicare/index.html)

The care giver would help with day to day stuff like preparing meals (possibly some cooking), cleaning, getting dressed, laundry, and other medical stuff ( putting lotion on skin ,etc.). It would be worthwhile to research that. Even if you get several hours per day of care giver services ( 3 to 5 hours), that's better than nothing.

I don't know if you're a religious person or not, this simple prayer may help:

 ""God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference""

Good luck to you.
I'm sorry you're going through this. I hold a very controversial stance on Alzheimer's denial: it's abuse. You're facing realities that are vital for your mom's welfare. 

Your dad is responsible for your mom, whether he wants to stay in denial or act responsible; legally he is responsible. He cannot leave her for moments at a time, much less days. 

I've dealt with this. Neglect is abuse and eventually there will be physical abuse, perhaps. Bruises appear on the sufferer's forearms, fingers and teeth get broken, all blamed on ""falls"". 

But eventually, there's a tipping point. I went to court and very gently began getting custody of my mom by suing my stepdad. The financial agreement with him to separate my mother's money from joint assets was shamefully small, but at least it was something. It's all been used on her carers and now I'm into my savings. 

Are you ready to take on full responsibility for your mom? As harsh as it may sound, I'd move out and get my own life at 19. I have a son older than you and it's been a hard choice to be solely responsible for my mom in late-stage Alzheimer's. 

You're not responsible for your mom and you get to choose. If you're gone, your dad's deficits may wake him up, but he may choose to stay in denial. Then there are legal consequences to his behavior. He will have to get help for her if he doesn't want the state taking over. 

It's really awful to lose both parents, effectively, to Alzheimer's. But you can have a life with more options. Your dad can't dump this on you without compensation, and your mom's money can go to her care, regardless of your dad's mindset. 

Someday perhaps a diagnosis will bring mandatory advocates assigned to the ""case"", but for now there are resources. You can call alz.org if you just need to talk. I have called them when doctors, my therapist, and my family didn't have the answers I needed. 

Of course I wish you all the best. Take care of yourself. Whatever you choose, you're not responsible for your mom. You get to decide how to help.
My mother was diagnosed when I was 11 - sharing so you can know someone else has been through not the same exact pain as you, but something like it. The isolation you experience can be so incredibly infuriating, and saddening. It makes sense to feel bitter with everything that has happened in your life. I am still learning how to handle those feelings and enjoy what I have, since this is the life I have to live. Allowing yourself to have fun is actually a major accomplishment, though that might sound impossible right now with how exhausted you are. 

A lot of people who have experienced different childhood trauma recover along similar paths, so there's community to be found in that. Seeing that you are looking toward a future where You are the person you take care of is an excellent sign of your resiliency. You're doing a great job handling a very difficult situation.
You *are* too young, and I'm so so sorry you have this weight on your chest. I am 26 and I feel like screaming, how how how how- I'm only 26.
Hello u/redascherrywine

Won't even pretend to understand your sorrow, rage, and despair. Cannot ever know what it's like to lose mom to early onset with you knowing her for less than half your entire life.

As impossible as this will sound, you must protect yourself by having compassion for them both because 20 years is a long time to be married and watch the woman whom you both loved disintegrate before your eyes with her dry skin and former sparkle like a forgotten show with those they loved most leaving early forever when the party was over. For now, as best you can, leave all the shitty stuff done to you by your parents and their friends in the manure pile.

Today, you have taken 19 spins around the planet (give or take a few months) which means that the perspective you have now is not informed by age but rather by tortuous experience that is devouring y'all whole. Your mom's early onset means EVERYONE needs help - NOW!

You have proven already that you have what it takes to protect your parents since they cannot release themselves from their own suffering to see what you need from them.

Here is some immediate wisdom from one with almost 50 turns around the planet with six relatives having died from Alz since own age 13 (for whatever that's worth):

1. When your dad is not around and you are certain to be safe, PLEASE contact the local domestic violence shelter for advice on developing a safety plan for you and your mom in case your dad turns violent again. There is no shame to call and you can reach them (free) 24/7 even if you have no reason to think that your dad will become violent again (his drinking makes this a much more volatile situation especially with him disappearing on you for days at a time - this behavior by itself is emotional abuse).
2. Dementia emotion drives exhaustion and rage which can (literally) be deadly or cause actions (including self harm) that you can never take back. No matter what, you MUST accept one truth that you already know: Both your parents cannot cope with sorrow and you are wiser from the benefit of their failures but you must NEVER be led by them. It's time to OWN your power as the only functioning adult in the household. YOU are IT, kiddo (sorry that you don't want to be - it's shitty and time to dig yourself out of the manure one turd at a time). See if you can get your friends to help you with small tasks such as running errands or making calls. It sounds like your friends would be delighted to help as difficult as it may be for you to ask. Never feel guilty - just ask - they can say no or reschedule for a better time as convenient. Those who truly care will help you.
3. Today, pick up the phone and contact a Nurse Case Manager (Registered Nurse or higher license) who will come to your home to provide a medical exam and evaluate your Mom's condition. The purpose for this visit is NOT to put your Mom in any facility. Instead, tell your dad that you are simply having a trained professional to come in and give advice to you both on next steps; and, it will hopefully be comforting for you and your dad to be able to ask questions about all possible next steps.  This visit will cost y'all about $125 per hour but it only takes about 2-3 hours (max - if not less) and will give you information that you need to help make informed decisions about your mom's care going forward. Plus, if your mom's condition was to worsen where she couldn't return home, then you have this person on your side to give medical expertise to assist the emergency room staff or to answer any random questions for as long as you want (day or night).
4. Consider getting another therapist that specializes in cognitive-behavior therapy. If you have been as up front with your current therapist as you have been in this Reddit post, then I am dubious that this therapist is providing you any effective or compassionate help.
I’m sorry   
my mom got diagnosed in 2017. During my mid thirties and I have been her full time caregiver ..I feel so bad for you since you never got to experience a normal teen life , but yeah I have to sacrifice all my time monitoring her from 11am to 9 pm ...my brother had to move back home because i couldn’t do this alone. He’s been a big help. He currently works at home as an accountant. I feel so bad because he was living a good life in San Diego with his own house and everything but had to sell everything & leave ...   
but I do love my mom and regardless of how Much she annoys me because of this disease. I still gotta stay strong. The only time me and my brother have freedom is during the late night hours from 10 pm till 10 am because my mom is sleeping. She doesn’t wander around like some Alzheimer’s patients.   
im just curious is she on any type of medication to help her control emotions. My mom has been on a anti depressant the neurologist prescribed and she has been more calm.   
Also I did have to quit my full time job ..but I was very fortunate to find side hustle gigs like doordash or Uber eats. I make $1000 or more each week. Just delivering food and my mom also comes along. Yes there are times when my mom gets annoyed or Emotional because I’m at the restaurants waiting for the order. Maybe you can work for one of these companies and bring your mom along while your delivering. Then you can save money.",2021-09-26 18:47:14,redascherrywine,pw45y4

Alzheimers,Suggestions to deal with my wandering father,"My dad was diagnosed about 3 years ago and is still in pretty good condition (has trouble conversing, can't follow multi-step directions, etc), and we're going on a family vacation next month.  We'll be staying at a beach house on vacation, and my sister and I are a little nervous about Dad having issues wandering around the house at night since it'll be a completely new place. 

My sister and I have each had experiences where Dad got lost in the middle of the night in our homes recently, and are wondering: does anyone have suggestions about ways to alert my mother if he leaves their bedroom at night?  Is there a sort of portable alarm system out there? Does anyone have any tricks they've used while traveling with an Alexander's patient? Thanks!","When my dad went through that phase we put a long string with bells on the door handle. So we'll you opened it they would clang loud. It worked. My mom would forget sometimes and open the door and scare herself. Lol. Those also have these alarms that I think are peel and stick that you could use. Or maybe switch out the sticky part for a command strip.

Something like this: https://www.harborfreight.com/door-window-entry-alarm-94983.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=12169617963&campaignid=12169617963&utm_content=116466576949&adsetid=116466576949&product=94983&store=209&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu8msQ8qNZhyIutiSt1YuG-YatvSxeY1Z-we3qU_D_QmlAr9DsUX1e8aAp7pEALw_wcB

We also used door knob safety covers and those worked great keeping him out of the garage.
You can buy cheap door/window alarms that make a loud noise. I put these in my parents apartment when my dad was still living there.
We used simple locks on everywhere.
Travel door alarms.  You can find them on Amazon for $15 each.  We have the Lewis N Clark brand and they worked well.",2021-09-26 11:04:41,rust-e-apples1,pvvl2a
Alzheimers,Dad with later stage alzheimer’s keeps falling at nursing facility.,"My dad is 73 and has rapidly declining later stage Alzheimer’s. He kept falling down a step or two at home, so we moved him into the memory care unit of a nearby nursing home 3 months ago. He started off ok, but is now refusing most food and liquid. This leads to him falling even more frequently, (3-5x a week) and he gets combative and aggressive with staff when they try to help. He just qualified for hospice today, but our issue is with him still being ambulatory, he’s a fall risk at all times. We don’t know what to do, as his risk of falling would happen anywhere, but we’re afraid he’s going to get kicked out of the facility. They said we can hire someone to watch him 24/7 and it’s an extra $700/day. 😑 Obviously this isn’t the first time this has ever happened to someone with ALZ, but we keep getting these emergency calls and not sure what else to do? Hospice is going to get him on seroquil, which i’m praying will help somewhat. Has anyone been through this before?","My Mom is also a fall risk, although she hasn't fallen in a couple of months. We ended up hiring a private caregiver for her 8 hours a day, and the staff tries to keep an eye on her the other 8 hours of the day when she's awake, popping in every hour to see if she needs a bathroom trip. Not perfect, but it's working so far. We talked to them about alarm systems and raising the rails on her bed, but California has a lot of laws about not constraining seniors, so none of these were an option.
Have they suggested that he use a walker or wheelchair? It’s not ideal but transitioning to mobility aids is typical in these situations. The difficulty lies in getting the person to use them, and in my experience it can take weeks sometimes months before the person is able to adapt and use them regularly.

The change in medication may help, but could also contribute to even more falls. Seroquel and other antipsychotics prescribed to dementia patients usually increase fall risks because of things like syncope and sedation. If the memory care does their job they will monitor him while his body adjusts to the new medication, which usually takes a week or two. It’s important to observe changes—good or bad—during this time, especially if his mobility is affected in any way. They should be looking for things like loss of balance, shuffling, etc. I imagine the hospice nurse/doctor started him off with low dose of Seroquel?

As for eating and drinking, do you know why he is refusing? It is a matter of selection, lack of appetite, the people he is around(his environment), etc? I have one gentleman who always has anxiety when it comes to eating because he thinks he has to pay for the food and doesn’t have money on him. But generally speaking, refusing to eat and drink is common so it’s just a matter of being creative and finding a solution that works best for your dad.
This is exactly my situation right now with my dad. I’ve been to the emergency room three time in a month. He gets very combative when they give him showers. He’s gotten very weak so he’s been calling a lot too. My dad is in a wheelchair now but there are times he will just get up and then fall. Hospice will be a great help. They will adjust his meds so he’s more relaxed. Hang in there!
A friend's father was similar.

A big, tall man, but he loved to roam around the place. The challenge was he forgot how to walk at times, resulting in falls.   

It was either restrain him or accept that falling is detrimental to his health. He was a kind and sweet person but forgot how to walk. 

End of the day he was happier, and just accept ""yep I fall"" and would get up and sit down. Since he was happiest that was the best thing they could do for him is accept falls weren't good for his health, but he was happy.
These falls are common cause of death, you have option to convince the person for slow walks, or not walking, or use wheelchair and accept only walking with a person, cover every furniture with sharp and hard endings with soft protection, make the person wear a nice beret all the time to protect head from open injuries, create a lot of holding points around the places he walk etc etc.",2021-09-26 01:27:00,yeauxleauxx,pvnkrb
Alzheimers,Power of attorney. Has any of you been through this yet..? I'm really not looking forward to it...,"I have two older siblings and we haven't had the discussion yet of who wants to become power of attorney...  


Some questions i'd appreciate if anyone could answer:  


1. Is it possible that the position be shared? Would that be beneficial? What downsides would there be?  

2. What exactly is involved with being power of attorney?  

3. How easy is the whole process of getting started  etc?  


Thank you","1. I believe it can be shared but seem to recall there would be a priority order based upon your decided preference: 1st, 2nd, etc.

2. The only purpose for POA is to make decisions in the event your loved one cannot or does not want to do so. In general, there is Durable Medical Power of Attorney and a different type that is for financial or other matters. Also, regardless of which type you have, make certain that each financial account your loved one has (cash, investments, pension, etc.) a Beneficiary Form on file with each entity. It’s not enough to have Power of Attorney and whatever the will says (if there is one) doesn’t matter, either. Without the Beneficiary Form, each account must go to Probate Court (which can take years) for a judge to decide on how to distribute any remaining assets in the estate (small or large). Of course, check with a board certified Estate Planning attorney in your area to be certain.

3. Overall, the hardest part is gathering all the documents that the attorney will need but this will help you save tons of money since you can negotiate to pay a flat fee rather than an hourly rate for doing all the work yourself (instead of your attorney or their law firm doing this for you).

Above all, NEVER do this yourself (it’s the only way to ensure you can legally protect your loved one and their assets). Check with the State Bar in your area to find a board certified Estate Planning attorney with a clean disciplinary record) this is free to do and won’t take long.
After my experience,   I STRONGLY recommend is power of Attorney when you see the first signs of dementia you get that taken care of and with their approval and while they're still able to help you.  Otherwise paranoia might set in and you'll be in a MUCH more difficult situation with someone that refuses to see a doctor for an exam and still has total control over everything in their lives.

getting their cooperation and approval for managing their life decisions  is far easier and better than having someone avoid the threshold diagnosis and fight you at every step. (it's a tragic nightmare)  IF you have to form a committee to kept checks and balances within the family then so be it.

It's better to have one responsible person in charge.decisions via committee are often base on  the lowest common dominator.

But that's better than someone being upset about something and making a big mess over it all.

Depending on the situation *what is required varies.*Meet with a lawyer or two and get some free opinions to help establish the lay of the land for your laws.  (do this now)

The process of taking control away from someone is always going to be difficult emotionallyBut it's a required step to help protect someone from being taken advantage of, used, abused *and to keep themselves protected from themselves.*

I can't understate it enough how important this is and how important that it be done early while the person can help you along with the process and not fight it like my father did.

Contact the local lawyers association and ask for a free referral/opinion list.

They'll give you some qualified lawyers for the local bar and you can explain your situation (briefly) and they'll ask you questions and give you their opinions on different possible courses of action.  This should all be done for **no change** (customarily)

**That's where you start.**
In new york it is pretty simple to set up.  My mother had her done.  But POA ends at death.  Something to remember.   The executors take over at that time.   It's a good idea to have them as the same.  

I only used the POA for about a month to pay her bills.  The more accounts and obligations they have will make it more difficult to run.
Look up your laws where you are to be sure. My sister and I share POA so it is possible. We both have to be on things like bank accounts. Medical POA is usually a separate thing, so don't forget to get that done too.
Get competent legal advise in your state.  My dad was my mother and his mother’s poa, but when he died suddenly, it all ended without a backup person.  My brother and I had to petition the court for guardianship of them.  We both were co guardians and that worked out for us.  But we were totally on the same page with their care, he’s a dr and I was the one near them.
I’m in Washington. I’m the sole POA for my mom, who is now in memory care. My younger sister is the backup. Same with executor in mom’s will… I’m the executor, sister is the alternate. I still run major decisions by my sister, so she’s aware of what is going on.

First, remember that (most of the time, at least), the person granting the POA is the one who decides what’s in it, hopefully with the help of a good estate attorney. What you can and can’t do is in the wording of the POA. In my case, I have complete control over her and her well-being. I have to decide where she lives, pay her bills (from her own accounts, fortunately, more on that below), her medical care, etc. Other people are doing the day to day work of feeding her, helping her bathe, etc., but it’s me who’s responsible for making the decisions. It can be a huge responsibility, and (unlike raising a child) you know the only end will come in grief when they finally pass.

I was granted POA in the fall of 2019, when mom’s dementia became serious and she could no longer live on her own. The only requirement in her POA was a determination by her doctor that she could no longer make her own decisions, which in our case was no problem. The doctor provided a written statement on clinic letterhead. A copy of that statement was provided with a copy of the POA to everyone who needed it: health insurance, her retirement plans, some of her investments (some I already had POA over), her bank…I can’t even think of them all now. Essentially, every government, social or business entity that she held an account for or paid money to/was paid money by needed a copy of the POA. I made a copy shop very happy one September afternoon.

It was time consuming getting all the ducks in a row, so to speak. I’d already been given POA over most of her investment accounts a few years before, though I’d never done anything with them. Another beneficial thing was that my sister and I were also co-owners/signers on her bank account, which meant there was no hassle about banking (though we had to provide POA to get into her safe deposit box and her retirement account, since she had a pension from that bank). My mom was a very organized person who put forth a lot of effort getting her affairs in order before she needed to. Alzheimer’s runs through the women of her family, so she had a good idea of what was coming.

Try to make sure your parent at least has a listing of all their accounts, safe deposit boxes, etc. It makes things sooo much easier. The most curious thing thing on my mom’s list was the little notation of “long term care insurance” with no other information. It was by luck we discovered the particulars of her paid-up long term care insurance plan, which is a godsend for her memory care!

Fortunately also my mom had sold her house several years before and moved into a retirement community, so we didn’t have to worry about preparing and selling the house, which would have been a whole new level of hassle even with POA. I did have to take her car keys away and sell the car, however. Some POAs allow the person to be “reasonably compensated” for their work; my sister told me I should take the proceeds of the car sale as part of my compensation. 

The worst part of being POA is being the person who has to make every decision. The absolute low point was the day we had to move my mom from her independent living community to a completely different facility for assisted living and, not long after, memory care. She was so angry she said she regretted giving me power of attorney. Of course she had no memory of it a few days later, but it was still my mom, in the voice she’d been talking to me with for 63 years, saying this to me.

While it may or may not be legally allowed to share the POA, I would think there’s a real chance it would be even harder than for one person, especially if the people sharing the job are physically distant. Sometimes you have to make decisions quickly, get stuff signed right away, etc.
Please look into a revocable trust. It gives you durable/medical/conservatorship and will prevent loved ones items from going through probate. Even with no one fighting the estates, my father and sisters things sat in probate over 3 years. Mom w ALZ, I just cannot allow it. Seek legal counsel for sure.
There are two kinds.  Medical power of attorney and durable power of attorney.   The responsibility can be shared in Texas but these things may differ by state.  If you aren't familiar with the documents, you will possibly need professional advice, however I know there are ""do-it-yourself-kits"" online.  You should hurry, it will not be a valid document if it is signed by someone who is confused or is on certain medications.
We went with 2 people as POA with a back-up. I was listed first since my schedule was most flexible and I always dealt with any crisis first but the siblings always knew I would consult them first as I often needed their wisdom to make choices.  The sibling that lived closest was put as #2 so if something needed a signature she could drive an hour to deal with it instead of me having to make an 8 hour round trip just to sign papers (luckily everywhere that needed my signature was willing to email me the forms and I could sign them via adobe signature app and send them back the PDF or else fax them via my husbands office).   We put a 3rd sibling on at the end of the POA form saying if #1 and #2 were unavailable #3 could make decisions.",2021-09-25 06:47:51,tinytempo,pv4g6y
Alzheimers,Dad was diagnosed yesterday. What to do while his symptoms are still mild?,"My dad has been having memory issues and confusion for the last year or so, and he finally agreed to get it looked at. Turns out that he has early stage Alzheimer's. I'm still processing, obviously, but have worked in healthcare long enough to know that there are some things that should be handled early while he still has (most of) his faculties.

* He is in his mid-70s and lives with his wife (my mom) full time. Given his lifestyle habits and other comorbidities, I expect that his prognosis will be on the shorter end of normal.

* He is a practicing healthcare worker, but has been informed that his license will be revoked due to his condition. This is very distressing to him, since he found a lot of meaning in his work.

* My parents are middle class and both are still working, though they had planned to retire in the next year or two. They have a nest egg and were not particularly concerned about finances in their retirement life until now. Now, we don't know what to expect as far as medical needs, costs, etc. They own their primary home outright, and have a condo with a 15yr mortgage they bought a couple of years ago in preparation for downsizing. They have a financial planner who was helping them with retirement, but I don't know if she's familiar with costs associated with Alzheimer's.

* My mom has a much better health profile than my dad, and it's clear she was suffering from caregiver fatigue even before this diagnosis. How do we ensure that her needs continue to be met and that this disease doesn't negatively affect her wellbeing as well?

I guess my question is: What should we be thinking about right now, while he's still pretty aware and able to make important decisions? Are there any good resources that you recommend? Given how new this is, we still need to have a robust discussion on next steps as a family, but I would like to come to that discussion with a good sense of priorities and how to get through this.","Medical and financial POA.

Discuss with both parents, their end of life wishes. 

It's slightly easier to move a parent before it gets bad, rather than once there is no choice but into care.
Find an elder care attorney first off.  They can help guide you through what's coming and make sure that dad's wishes are met without hurting mom.
Somebody shared this advance directive in another thread recently. It lets people indicate what level of care they would like at different stages of dementia. It's not a legal document, just a way to communicate our preference ahead of time.

[https://dementia-directive.org/](https://dementia-directive.org/)
Write down any family history or stories - go through pictures while he can still explain.  Write down his favorite bands, music and movies. Books as well. Ask if he’d like, once he passes, donations be made to a charity he likes. 
If you have other siblings make sure everyone is in the same page with care etc. cuz that can get messy. Been going through this for the past year. My mind is now in hospice care / sometimes health can fade faster than you think.  All the best
Get all of his papers in order. Power of attorney, health care proxy, etc. Consult with an elder care attorney.
Get Power of attorney (both medical and financial) squared away for both of them, immediately, as well as a medical advanced directive.
Find something to give him purpose. A hobby like gardening or social activities. Losing her job was the worst part for my mom's diagnosis, nothing to occupy her time.
Are you in the US
Both POAs, will, passwords, car titles ect. 

I put my daughter on my checking account just in case I go first.
Well Spouse Association for your mom! Many of our members' partners have Alzheimers and other memory-related issues. [wellspouse.org](https://wellspouse.org) or r/WellSpouses for more details. 

Best wishes to you.
One thing to think about is that if anything happens to your mom, it can be so painful to have to shove grieving aside to get your dad through it. I've been there after my dad went from a yearly exam to being told he was perfectly healthy to having a brain tumor diagnosed following a stroke and ending his life a couple of months  later. We didn't have time to grieve that loss as our mom needed us.

Work with an attorney. You definitely need POAs and a will if it's not in place. Advance directive while he's able, and if there is even a slim chance he could end up in assisted living, talk to his doctor about a COLST/MOLST or whatever it's called in your area. Doing a COLST as my mom's memory slipped was a little more challenging than it had to be had I known it was a requirement for assisted living.

It's also a good time to look at the home and what would make it safer. My mom's depth perception became an issue earlier rather than later. She kept missing steps and falling. Sturdy rails, grab bars in the bathroom, get rid of any decorative rugs that may slip. She also became a master at turning back on the gas if we turned it off to keep her from using the oven or furnace in the summer when we had to go out. I came in on a 90 degree day to find she'd turned off the AC and had turned the furnace up as hot as it would go and turned on the gas to get the heat running. We had to put up stop signs everywhere to keep her from touching the gas valves, thermostat, or AC controls. Eventually, we moved her for her safety as she started to not recognize her house, even after living there for 50 years.
Contact your local Alzheimer's Association. They have information resources and access to services. These are people who have been through this before. Very helpful.
How was your dad being diagnosed as early stage Alzheimer?

What kind of test was performed to come to that medical conclusion?
Get financial and medical POA
Please consider getting the book: The End of Alzheimer’s by Dale Bredesen, MD. Even if your dad doesn’t have Alz, there might be hope to either slow or reverse his condition since it’s early in the disease; however, it’s not a cure.

In addition to getting this book, please see if there may be a medical doctor in your area who is trained in the Bredesen treatment protocols (also called ReCode) because there are patients who have reversed their dementia through a stringent commitment to heathy eating, no sugar or starchy carbs as well as daily exercise and consistent sleep. In addition, with information based upon an individual’s DNA test results (done with a blood draw), there will be a tailored treatment given to address one’s unique genetic code based upon ongoing scientific studies which are shown (to date) to be most effective in combatting the disease. 

In addition, for anyone who may want to know, the genetic test can tell anyone their risk to develop particular conditions including Alz which is known to have a genetic component. Those who carry the apoe3/apoe 4 gene combo have a 30 percent chance to develop Alz whereas those with apoe4/apoe4 combo have a 90 percent chance. 

I wish we’d had this book before seeing six relatives suffer and die from dementia because now there’s maybe something we could have done to stop it. My Mom was diagnosed three weeks ago with Alz and we are following these protocols in Texas because, right now, it’s our best chance to help even if it doesn’t work!

Please never give up trying to slay dementia! Now, we can try, but it’s never easy or guaranteed!
Record every damn moment, talk talk talk. Exercise together and get sun and fresh air as much as possible.",2021-09-24 13:30:20,bateneco,puoklg
Alzheimers,Question to those of you who saw your parent/parents slipping into beginning stages of Alzheimer’s,In what ways did they act differently during early stages of Alzheimer’s? I’m wondering because I think my mom (63) might be in the early stages of Alzheimer’s but it’s hard to tell.,"My dad repeated things a lot. Like we would be on the phone and he would tell me something and then a few minutes later tell me the exact same thing the exact same way
My dad was just diagnosed yesterday with early stage Alzheimers, and I'm obviously still processing. While challenging to accept, it isn't particularly surprising, since we've been noticing that he's been acting differently over the last couple of years, with what feels like more substantial changes over the last year.

The things that we noticed:

* Difficulty remembering names, which manifested as describing someone by their relationship instead (eg: him asking ""How's your son doing?"" as opposed to ""How's [bateneco jr.] doing?""

* Occasional confusion about where he was (eg: him saying ""I'm going to run over to [my favorite coffee shop] for a bit"" even though we were traveling in another state.

* Got lost while driving in an area that was relatively familiar to him

* A little more withdrawn, particularly in group conversations...just not saying much, getting tired and excusing himself early, etc.
My mom was pretty good at hiding it for a while (which is probably common), but the things we noticed first were these:

- Issues with keeping up with bills/money. She would forget to pay them, or think she had already.

- issues with buying things from tv shopping shows. Specifically jewelry tv. When I finally decided it was time to force myself into her finances I found over 70 purchases in one month. She would forget that she'd ordered something even earlier that day apparently. When we went through her house moving her in with us we found a bunch of unopened packages from them.

- I noticed she started telling stories I had heard my entire life differently. People involved would change, outcomes were different.

- I noticed she started to lie to answer questions she didn't know/remember the answer to. Usually short term simple things like whether she had eaten or not.

- Repeating things she had just said a few minutes earlier.

- eating habits went downhill. We noticed she would do things like have ice cream, then forget and get more ice cream, then forget and have more a little later. Edited to add: after she did this she loudly and angrily asked who the hell was eating all the ice cream. Which, lets face it, was pretty funny.
In addition to agreeing with /u/No-Consequence-9952 ~

It's pretty normal for people to occasionally repeat the same story they told not 5 minutes ago.  And it's pretty natural for us to say ""Dude, you just said that!"".

In the ""normal"" version of this, you'll get a response like ""What?  Seriously?  Oh, wow, I must be losing my marbles!""  They show some level of awareness that it's not ""business as usual"" to repeat things like that

With my mom, there was no such awareness.  She was completely unconcerned, almost as if *you* were being a bit of a weirdo for mentioning such a thing.  And not in an offended way, not defensively, just ""Sheesh, whatever..""  

And then 5 minutes later, repeat the story again..
A big red flag is when they become incapable of performing regular, essential tasks, like paying bills or taking medication.

My mother paid her bills online, and one day she called me, frustrated to tears, because, ""My bank changed their entire website! I can't figure out how to do anything!""

When I went to help her, the bank's site was exactly the same as I remembered it; she simply had no reading comprehension. She stared at a button that read, ""Pay Bills Online"" for minutes, then threw her hands up and said, ""I give up!"" So I took over for her. Just to give an idea of how much of a change this was for her: in her work as a shot-nurse, she had, maybe three years prior, taught her entire work office (of much-younger men and women) how to renew their nursing certifications online. She was very much computer-savvy.

This lack of reading comprehension spread to other things, as well; when she and I went out to dinner, she couldn't understand the menu, and complained that, ""They've changed their entire menu, and removed all the things I liked!"" So I had to start ordering for her.
One of the odd little things I noticed..

You know how your Mom always has her pet things she rags you about? You always forget to blah, blah, or you should call me more often, etc. etc.

All of that stopped with my Mom. She completely forgot to nag, which sounds like good news at first until the penny drops and you figure out why.
A lot more anxiety/paranoia especially at night. Also, they bought multiples of things thinking they didn’t have it already
One of the first clues for me was my mom called me one afternoon and said we hadn't talked in weeks. She'd called me just two hours earlier to tell me the same things.

Then there was another situation about a year later where she was having a very hard time remembering anything. She called it brain fogs. She'd just started taking cholesterol med her doctor prescribed, so we assumed it was the medication. I'm not so sure anymore.ld retire or he would be forced to fire her. This was very unlike her and it worried me.

Her doctor wrote it off as grief as her sister had died a month earlier. Meanwhile, I kept going back to a situation that had happened a few years earlier. I got a call at 8 p.m. that my mom took a wrong turn on the way home and had no idea where she was or how to get home. I had to figure out where she was from the landmarks she gave and figure out where to go. She was 30 miles from her house, 60 miles from me. I still have no idea how she ended up there.

Then there was another situation about a year later where she was having a very hard time remembering anything. She called it brain fogs. She'd just started taking cholesterol meds her doctor prescribed, so we assumed it was the medication. I'm not so sure anymore.

I pushed her doctor to get the referral to the memory care clinic near her. It took months, but I succeeded and she was diagnosed with MCI, which progressed to Alzheimer's within a year. That was almost 12 years ago now, but I can go back about 16 years when I noticed subtle things that I now question.
Obsessing over things - ""did the mailman come?"" Confusion. Talking about people & events from 30 years ago as if it was now.  Eating less, and then the associated weight loss. Having to remind them to eat, go to bed,  take a bath, change their clothes.

Take her to a DR. Its best to get a diagnosis, and gauge the level of advancement of either Dementia or Alzheimer  (if that is what it is),  so you can begin planning and adjusting for what is ahead.
With my mom, I noticed a diminished ability to focus, becoming more withdrawn, and some surprising logic gaps. But the big one was when she couldn't remember people she'd known for decades. 

For example: before I ever thought Alzheimer's, I noticed her driving ability declined, especially driving & trying to hold a conversation. She couldn't drive safely & talk and if she focused on the road, she couldn't follow the conversation. 

At home, she'd get very focused on completing a task - like she had to ignore everything and everyone else until that task was done & things had to be done in a very specific order or she'd get annoyed - she had always been much more flexible even into old age. In retrospect, I think that rigidity was because it was how she could be sure she'd completed the thing correctly. 

I connected the dots during Christmas card season, I noticed she was studying the Christmas cards, so I asked her what the news was and she said, ""Oh, they didn't write a letter. I'm just trying to remember how we know them. We're not related, but I know they have twin girls and that older boy and..."" Then proceeded to tell me everything she knew about them & it was all stuff you could infer from their Christmas photo. This was a family friend she's known for 20 years who actually lived with her for about a year after college & still stopped by to visit whenever he was in town. 

If you're noticing sudden personality changes or behavioral differences, it isn't necessarily dementia, but it is still be a good idea to get it checked out. The obvious memory lapses where they seem surprised when it is pointed out to them - not like forgetting a word or a name they instantly know again, but like they are having to take in that piece of information like it is new again - that's a bad sign.
[deleted]
\- Numbers/concepts stopped having meaning. (When he asked the date, I would tell him, and then he would ask what 2017 (the year) meant.) Couldn't do basic math (used to be able to run addition/subtraction/multiplication/division of multiple digit numbers together in his head).

\- Easily frustrated to the point of towering anger and threatening body-language. Dad was known for being even tempered, calm, and patient. In the year before his diagnosis, he smashed two land-line telephones to pieces because of malfunctioning phone lines or forgetting the number he was trying to dial.

\-Loss of spatial awareness - this one's hard to describe, but essentially not being aware of your surroundings, backing up/walking into things/people, tripping over curbs or steps much more often. Being unable to tie shoes, line up buttons.
My mom started talking less on the phone. Her hour conversations turned to 30 minutes because she couldn't remember news to update me on.
When we had family dinners, my dad would get quiet, when he used to be the life of the party. He could only make the most basic small talk, like “Isn’t this (setting) lovely?” He also had problems with spacial reasoning. My mom would ask my dad to put something away in a closet and he couldn’t figure out how to make it fit.
The first one: Repeating of questions they had asked (and received answer to before) several times in same hour

And around the same time: reduction in normal activities (especially reading), and a sort of more distant than usual stare when FaceTiming.
My dad was diagnosed with early onset at 60, four years ago. 

I did not notice much the first year. Little things forgotten. Chores, times. 

The second year, he never used to run late and now he always does. Bc he forgets about things he needs to do beforehand. And then forgets he was doing this things. 

Third year, he’s a jackass lol my kind and compassionate father has lost his tact. He can be rude to people in public, and was not a confrontational man before. 

This year, he forgot my moms bday, Valentine’s Day, and Mother’s Day. Night before he tells me to get cards for him. Which is devastating bc he is known for picking the best ones. I did my best.
My grandmother would start getting lost coming to our house, a 25 minute ride she did for 20 years. Once she hit a mailbox with her car but didn’t remember where- that’s when it fully hit us. It’s genetic on my moms side so now I know to keep a close eye.
My mom started socially isolating, making excuses not to talk on the phone and canceling plans. She also started nervously clearing her throat all of the time.

However, we didn’t pick it up at that stage. She started getting anxious about everything and lost a ton of weight.  That started appts that eventually led to more.
The first thing thing was word searching. She couldn’t think of the word she wanted to say. Then she started having a hard time calling us. “I tried to call you but the number was wrong!”  Then her long distance service on her land line got accidentally deactivated so she would get weird automated messages and thought we were just too busy to talk to her. I called her provider and got it resolved but she couldn’t understand what had been wrong and what had been fixed, just kept going in circles talking about how we were too busy or in meetings which is why she couldn’t get through. 

Her bills were a mess but her boyfriend got her set up with auto billing instead of encouraging her to have one of her kids get power of attorney and take over her finances. He was an accountant so he should have known better. By the time we got her declared incompetent, it was a scavenger hunt trying to figure out what she had and where she had it.
Our big red flag was asking the same questions over and over in a short period of time, i.e. over a single sit down dinner. We don't see her too often, and she's pretty socially shy, so we just assumed she didn't know what to say and would keep asking my wife ""how are your parents doing?"" or something to that effect. Finally we convinced my Dad that something was up and they got her checked out.. probably 3 years later than they should have.
With my dad, it was little things at first, like he would be telling a story and sort of leave out the middle of it. Or a point he was trying to make, etc. Like, if a normal train of thought went A>B>C, he would sort of go from A>C, and leave out the B. Or he couldn't figure out some basic things that he wouldn't have trouble with normally. Like in the beginning he was helping me sign up for some account online, but couldn't figure out how to go from one page to the next, like hit the submit button or something similar. And a little bit later on, but still in the early stages, he would just forget certain words or terms. He needed help getting online, but instead of saying ""I need help getting online"", he said ""I need help getting to the world."" because it was the ""world wide web"" to him, and I think his browser icon had a globe on it or something.
I think the first things we noticed about my dad was that he was starting to look for things in the house in a place that we had never put it since we moved into that house.
Doing stuff wrong that they had done right for years, decades even.

Like getting lost on the way to or from work. Cooking a recipe they knew by heart and screwing it up. 

They will still seem normal in other ways, and no friends and most family members will not notice anything wrong. But people they live with will wonder, and it will look like this. Making mistakes doing things that are generally second nature to them.

I remember during a diagnostic, my dad couldn't remember what year it was or who was president, and didn't know where he was. But that was a bit after he got lost coming home from work.
The thing that I notice first is that she couldn't deal with complex problems. My job took us to the Midwest and now we were looking to move back to Pennsylvania. She suddenly was evaluating homes differently. Any single flaw, the tiniest thing, triggered a hard NO. Before this she talked through homes with minor problems, discussing costs to make changes. Her ability to deal with complexity just disappeared.
My mom forgot things that she’s taught me. The Boxing Day tsunami, she was complaining that they used such a foreign fancy name for a wave. She taught me that word way in elementary, when she was showing me some magazine. It kept progressing and it took her time to come up with words.
Unfortunately I’m either experiencing the same thing or I am magnifying it in my own head. I dunno.
My Dad would not have memories of things he just did or conversations he had earlier in the day/earlier that hour. It was different to normal forgetting because he couldn't be reminded that it happened - for him it was like it had never happened.
One of my mum's earlier signs was a growing lack of confidence - for instance, she'd start to cook a roast, but would have to double check with several people how long it should cook for, and then she'd worry that the meat would be over/under done (even though it was fine).  Very early on, there were a few isolated incidents ... she couldn't work out how to turn the shower off once; another time (probably 12 months later) she could remember how to turn the car headlights on.  Slowly the repetition of stories would start, along with forgetting words/names/events.
Missing social cues, conversation-wise.  Struggling with basic technology (tv remote, laptop).  Driving skills degrading.  Withdrawn instead of his usual social self.  Once on a business trip he got lost and didnt know how to use his phone to find his hotel, police helped him as they saw him walking down a road at night.

Alzheimers,With tied hands,"Today we tried taking my grandmother into a nursing home that specializes into taking care for dementia patients, but she tried to run away. She was very aggressive and basically the home refused to take her in. We can't take her into another facility because the same thing will repeat again nor we can hire a nurse to look after her because of her behavior. She has been on antipsychotics, but they don't seem to calm her at all. I (25yo) have been her main care giver, but I can't emotionally handle this situation any longer. I am tired of having to chase her around the apartment building a few times a day, her trying to beat me or yell at me. My family also refuses to look after her. So this entire situation seems very hopeless. On the other hand I can't just leave her she is the person who raised me.
Has anyone been in the same situation? I now that I should probably take legal actions, but this will probably take months.","Just because one won't take her, another might. Go to the hospital and ask for a psych hold. The words to use are ""She's a danger to herself and others."" That happened with my mom and she had to go out of state, but she's in a facility now that is a great match for her. They are trained in Haldol injections, which kept her from flying into a rage at everyone around her. Do I feel guilty that she's so far away, sure, but I know trying to be her caregiver was taking a toll on my mental and physical health. Eight months later, I'm still undergoing medical scans and tests to figure certain things out.
I understand your situation. I had similar experiences with my mother... Very upset, combative, hitting, mashing. She had mobility problems so she could run away. 

The nursing homes wont accept her because she is a danger to others and herself. 

A story about my late mother. In the final stages mother was admitted to the hospital for an infection and aspiration pneumonia. She was treated and released to a nice rehab facility. The staff was advised of her condition and behavior. She was in constraints most of her time there while she there recovering. She was approaching the end of her rehab stay. The NY State would not allow my mothers care at home (long story). She was not a good candidate for any nursing homes. Its the worst situation. My father found a nursing home after weeks of persistent calls/interviews. She was admitted as a resident. Two weeks into hee stay she had a fight with another resident. A week later she fell and broke her femur near the ball. She went back to the first rehab center for hospice care/palliative care. She declined quickly. Two weeks later she passed.

I feel for you and your situation. Check with your local ALZ Association for nursing home advise.
I’m so sorry you have to deal with this. My mom wandered off sometimes but then was wheelchair bound by the end so she couldn’t just go off. I don’t have any advice, just I’m sorry.
Memory Care Director of a care home here - when I have residents that are combative I make sure I look inward first.

Is there any way that she might be in pain? Tooth infection, sores on feet, bottom, incontinence? Hungry? Loud noises? Boredom? Major change in medication? Too hot or too cold? Uncomfortable clothing? 

The answer to all of these could be fine and it absolutely could just be the part of her brain that is being affected by the disease, but it worth making sure you check all of these boxes before resorting to medication. 

If she continues to be a harm to herself and others, you should 302 her (involuntary commitment to the psych hospital) because I doubt she will go on her own. They will be able to sort her meds out here, safely. It's not my favorite solution, but sometimes when it gets to this point, it is necessary.

I really hope you get some relief soon. Please feel free to message me privately, I handle situations like yours all of the time and it is a huge passion of mine. I firmly believe those suffering with a form of dementia are extremely misunderstood. 

Best of luck to you, she is very lucky to have you

As /u/WantDastardlyBack mentioned ""Danger to herself and others"" may be the key to the right kinds of services.

One possibility ~ You say the anti-psychotics don't work.  I don't know how many different meds of this type have been tried, but I'd suggest making it well known to the prescribing Dr. that the current medication isn't helping.

My mom never had the level of aggression your grandma seems to have.  But she got put on Prozac (antidepressant, not antipsychotic) before it was determined her memory problems weren't caused by depression.  Later she was taken off the Prozac, and turned out even though technically she wasn't depressed, her temperament got *much* worse without it, hostile, uncooperative, just all round mean and nasty.

So there are other drugs to be tried besides antipsychotics.  (Additionally, there are quite a number of different antipsychotics).

Seems to me her Dr. should be will to try every possibly psychoactive drug before throwing in the towel, and if they're resistant, I'd say rattle their cage, be a pest, nag them to death (if you see what I mean!)

It might help if you have some specific alternative medications in mind to ask Dr. about ~ Based on my story, you can ask about Prozac.  You might post another question to this sub asking specifically about what meds helped with aggression, and you could crosspost in /r/dementia , and /r/AgingParents ..

Good luck!
Great resources here:  https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving
It may seem hopeless, but you do have options.

First off, I think she needs her medication regimen changed. Her current meds don’t seem to be controlling her behavior and anxiety. You could try talking to her current physician and letting them know your struggles. Maybe she needs something that could be given for anxiety as needed (PRN) to help in particularly stressful situations. You could also take her to a hospital and let them know that she is a danger to herself because she is not able to care for herself and doesn’t let others care for her. They may be able to help you find a place for her because they have case managers/social workers that do this all the time. They can also give her medicine to keep her calm and safe. With the way she is wandering, she does need to be in a memory care or locked facility so she doesn’t wander somewhere she could get hurt. 

You are doing a great job and I’m so sorry you don’t have much support. Try reaching out to the local alz association to see if there is at least a respite program in the area to give yourself a break. This is a marathon, not a sprint and you have to take care of yourself in order to be there for her.

Alzheimers,Grandma speaks gibberish nonsense and we don't know how to handle it,"I'm not the best at explaining things, so please bear with me.

My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and it's been hard on everyone. But most recently, she's been saying gibberish all the time. It is completely involuntary and uncontrollable. It goes something like this- ""babababbababa..."" There's also a lot of other noises and sounds involved, but mostly this. She goes on for hours at this and not to mention, it's extremely loud. I'm worried sick that her vocal cords might tear in the process. 

My mom and I are her primary caretakers now. We are trying our best to calm her down but it seldom works. Our doctor has prescribed sleeping pills, but we don't wanna give it to her everyday as it has too many side effects. My grandma is 80 and she can sleep on her own, most of the time. But, right now, it just went completely out of control. We tried to make her tell stories, whatever she remembers, and she tells it. But the moment the story is over, the gibberish starts. I don't think she is even aware that she is doing this. It breaks my heart to see my grandma like this. 

I would appreciate any advice on how we can deal with this. It's been weeks since my mom and I slept properly and it is just painfully exhausting for everyone.

I apologize for errors, English is not my first language.","Sounds like her doctor prescribed Ambien or a benzodiazepine.  There are other sleep medications you could try such as trazodone and mirtazapine which have less serious side effects.  Seroquel is an antipsychotic that can help with sleep and behavioral changes as well.
Turn on some music and even better if it has visuals. AXS on direct TV has been great.
You might ask him about Seroquel. It’s tranquilizing, and has antipsychotic benefits, also.
It sounds like she gets ""stuck"" repeating herself -- it's involuntary, and stopping is beyond her control. I learned that the speech area in the brain is one of the early areas to start dying off in an Alzheimer's patient, so maybe her ""baby sounds"" are a form of regression. (It's good that she can still have conversations, though.)  

When she starts vocalizing that way, try to divert her attention to break the rhythm of her repetitions. If she's able to eat, give her a treat she enjoys, sort of an oral trade -- a popsicle to replacs the babbling. (And btw, I learned it helps to hand the treat to her physically as you offer it so she can see and feel it. Patients have a difficult time comprehending and making a decision when asked something verbally. They need other sensory cues as well.

As u/rudderusa suggested, music is amazing as a diversion and for some patients, it changes the atmosphere like magic. The ability to enjoy music and recognize familiar tunes remains with patients long after other brain functions shut down. It's a gift.",2021-09-22 15:34:37,thelonelyasshole,ptf5xm
Alzheimers,Update on alprozolam/xanax for anger/insomnia,"Hello all!
I posted a couple of months back about the doctor prescribing my dad alprozolam to calm him.
It made his insomnia,anger, wandering and delusions worse.
When we took him to the hospital they said that Xanax can be disinhibiting instead of the intended calming effect.For my dad, it was like somebody took the dial on all his symptoms and cranked it up.

I'm posting this for the purpose of information. It's not going to be everybody's experience, but I wish I had known this was a possibility when the doctor prescribed it for my dad.

Stay strong everyone. This disease sucks!","My mom was the same way. They switched her to Haldol eventually and that worked best, but now she's progressed and is in a wheelchair, so her doctor stopped all meds.
Started my wife off on Clonazepam which helped calm her but she was still getting up at all hours of the night, hard on me. Doc then put her on Seroquelle (sp) before bedtime and it is much better for both of us.
Thanks for sharing. This post might help me later with my dad.",2021-09-22 00:11:09,Nichoala,pszmq9

Alzheimers,Alzheimers Gma is Abusive *tw violence*,"Hi all, first time posting so bear with me.

My 89yo gma is nearing the end, I think. She has been diagnosed with Alzheimers for several years, but her state has declined rapidly since the pandemic started, I think partially due to the elimination of her limited stimulation- church and bingo. 

My husband (25m) and I (29f) have been her primary caretakers for going on 3 years. In her normal life, my gma was always a friendly, cheerful person, typical grandma shit. I can't say we had the closest relationship, as she is pretty religious and I am not, but she was never a mean or malicious person. That has changed dramatically, and I'm at the end of my rope. 

My husband and I got married in dec2019, right before pandemic started. So during our still very new marriage, when we should be enjoying ourselves, the whole world went on lockdown and we were constantly caring for my gma. We have had to do the typical alzheimers things- she's completely incontinent, constant repeated conversations, locking the pantry/fridge so she wouldn't eat literally everything in the fridge (including jars of mayo or sticks of butter). She had been throwing some fits for about the last year and a half, but in the past month these fits have become violent. She has threatened me with a knife, swung a hammer at my husband, and today, broke my bedroom door by smashing her walker against the doorknob repeatedly, while I desperately tried to lead a meeting for my work from home job and couldn't get her to simmer down.

She spits on us, hits us, bites us, calls us horrible names, accuses us of stealing from her, lies constantly. I know it's the disease but my sympathy is rapidly running out. She doesn't quite qualify for hospice care yet, but I'm at a loss because my safety is at stake. I can't even reasonably defend myself, because if I push her off and she gets hurt, it's going to look really bad. 

The cops don't bother coming any more, they've been called several times due to her yelling and screaming at us. They know by now we're not abusing her, she's just completely off her rocker.

I feel very isolated here- my mom has been somewhat helpful but is also an extremely busy woman. Her siblings are almost no help- one never visits except for $ and the other lives really far away and can only come occasionally.  It is causing a lot of strain on my marriage, because when we first came here to help out this hecticness was not part of the agreement. I should also mention that we do not stay here for free and we are not freeloaders- in addition to giving her care, I pay rent and buy my own groceries, pay my own bills etc. I'm literally paying to be abused. I just want to go one day without being yelled at, called a bitch, etc.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I guess i just wanted to vent. I'm wondering how close to the end we are- does anyone have any similar experiences? Thx for reading if you made it this far.","The situation you describe is not sustainable.  You and your husband will run out of time, money, patience, energy, love for your grandma, love for each other... it all drains away because being abused is soul destroying.  All caregivers need to have boundaries, and give of what they actually have to give.  This person is no longer your grandmother, it's a patient who doesn't care about you and cannot be trusted, and whose needs exceed what you can possibly supply over the long term.  That doesn't mean throw her out on the street, but best for everyone is to take care of yourself first.  You know how on the airplane they always say place the oxygen mask on yourself first and then assist your child?  It's the same thing here.  You can only help in a meaningful way if you are intact.  What that means in practical terms could be any number of things, but I think it's pretty obvious that it means your current situation must change immediately.

Your grandmother could still live a long time like this, so in my opinion you need to be thinking about a different living arrangement, almost certainly a place such as a memory care facility.  There is a local number in my community which is a mental health hotline at the local university, and they have a 24 hour mental health emergency number and intake process.  I have it in my phone at the ready at all times.  So far I haven't needed to use it, but if I were in your situation (I was close recently) I could easily see myself calling it and/or going there.  Maybe there is such a place in your community.  If you look into memory care, read the reviews and ask around.  There are good ones and bad ones.

Prepare for family members to hate every choice you make, but unless they are prepared to help in a meaningful way, they don't get a vote.  My heart goes out to you and your husband and I wish you the very best in all you do.
Something that hasn't been mentioned yet is that going to a memory care/nursing home might actually help your grandma's symptoms in some ways. She will have more socialization and more caregivers to assist her. Agitation around not being at ""home"" is definitely common, but trained professionals are more equipped to deal with these episodes. Rather than the police, you may want to look into getting a social worker involved who can provide better assistance with helping to find placement and coordinating care. You can find one through your local/state area agency on aging or through the state board of social services. Your doctor or health insurance provider may be able to recommend someone as well. Whatever you decide, I sincerely wish the best for you and your family.
I can relate to your frustration! It sounds stressful and -- well-- SCARY to have someone assault you verbally or physically when you're trying to help them! 

There are some strategies dealing with Alzheimer's patients that a woman named Teepa Snow teaches. I found her videos extremely helpful, actual lifesavers when my SIL and I were learning how to care for my brother. I'll share some of the most helpful videos. She's good at explaining what's happening in the brain of an Alzheimer's patient and how to be supportive & empathetic -- but also effective at motivating them to listen to you and follow your guidance.

I’m new at this but would consider medication under a doctors supervision. Perhaps not the first time but it sounds like a trend, so it’s really the best for everyone especially her.
Yes my dad was something like that when i was in hs. He never threatened me with a knife though, but he did try to break the door down when I was doing homework and locked the door so he wouldnt trash my room several times a day. He had also at some point had my mom in a headlock (i wasnt at home). 

Do you send her to day care during your work day? Maybe if a place has a good rep for maintaining covid protocols? Or maybe even a home, if you think your safety is under threat. It doesn't feel great to consider ""sending them away,"" but.. If your new marriage and physical safety is under threat, id seriously consider it. 

Also.. Have you been keeping in touch with her doc over her agitation? There are meds that can keep them calm/sedated. I think my dad was on some bc he was a *strong* angry Alzheimer's guy. And im pretty sure at least one person reading your post will suggest cbd, but i don't have any experience with that. Whatever you do, just consult with thier doc first tho. 

 Unfortunately from what I know, and from my experience, the only way this gets ""easier"" without intervention is when the Alzheimer's gets worse, and they are less mobile :( . Sorry you are going through this.
She is not meaning to lash out, it’s the disease. The examples you are showing are key to showing you can not help this way anymore. She won’t be able to change. I would look for a memory care facility and they can help her focus on being calm, get her some meds to help her get maybe back to normal. Keep her safe and keep her occupied. It’s not giving up as some people say. You are just starting your life out with each other, that is important too.

Reach out to aplaceformom.com they do not charge for finding a place for your loved one, they also can help you find ways to get financial assistance. 

I will probably get downvoted again, that’s alright. I know not every person is the same. The ones that are triggered by suggestions like this, probably has way different circumstances than this case, or my case. If it works for you and your loved one, I am happy for you and yours. And I’m happy you couldn’t understand. Peace may be with you.
I don't have any additional advice to add to those that have already replied, I just wanted to say that I feel for you and you have my sympathy.  Best of luck with it all xxx  (Oh, but I definitely agree that some people will judge you no matter what the outcome or decision - but unless they're holding up their hand to take care of her, or contributing in some other practical and useful way, they don't get a vote in what happens next!)
I'm just baffled that you aren't getting paid by the family members. It's either paying for hospice or for your care. At least, if you are compensated financially, it's easier to treat it as a job.
Ask her doctor about medication, when my mom became violent her psychiatrist prescribed phenazepam, I'm not sure if it's available in your country. That day  I finally got about 5 hours of sleep. First time In months. It was wonderful
In our case that behavior started about year and a half before ""the end"", but our case was very aggressive and it was just 5 years from the diagnosis to the end.
There's nothing I can say that you haven't heard before, just try to take care of yourself, try to rest as much as possible, don't feel guilty for feeling angry and don't let this disease to overtake your life. You can do it❤️
Talk to a social worker. If you don't know of one, call the local Alzheimer's Association chapter, memory care clinic, or the Agency on Aging and ask for one. I've been there and have a cousin going through it now. If your grandmother is declared a danger to herself and others, they tend to take better action. Police are untrained for mental health is far too many areas, and that limits what they can do. Once she's declared a danger to herself or others, they'll look into options to help you. Adult day programs, a memory care community, or having 24-hour caregivers to help you out. My mom was put on Haldol until she required a wheelchair or was bedridden. That stopped her from trying to harm others. My cousin's mother is going to go to an adult day program in the day and have 24-hour caregivers to help during the night until they get her a bed at a memory care community.
My mom went to daycare only.  If your gma can get meds that calm her down and she can go to day care you will get a break.  If your gma has money that you can use for her care, then do it.  Don’t worry about what the family says, you are the one doing the work.
I work on a dementia unit at a nursing home doing activities, the stage your g-ma is in, most definitely calls for long term care OR a lot more outside help then it seems you can get at the moment. I would recommend contacting Medicaid and seeing what they can do for you. She’ll have a lot more stimulation, activities throughout the day, full time carers and 3 meals + snacks a day. For your own mental sanity, at least look into options.

I know it’s not easy, and you probably feel like you are abandoning her. But do you think your real g-ma you know and love would want her to hurt you or feel unsafe around her? She’d agree with that kind of decision if you had to make it. You can still go visit her and spoil her and love her, but the stress and bitterness won’t be there. You can’t take care of anyone else if you can’t take care of yourself first.

Alzheimers,Groundbreaking Research Identifies Likely Cause of Alzheimer’s Disease,,,2021-09-19 17:21:20,IDislikeHomonyms,prgslq
Alzheimers,Do you think she's sick or just mean?,"My mom has been acting strange for a few years now. Having serious conversations and making life changing plans then saying we didn't. For instance when I was pregnant we had a big discussion about how she wanted me to move home to the farm and raise the kids and look after her. That wasn't my plan but we decided we would because she's on a small income and we could pay her bills. It would also save us rent money because she owns the home so it would help everyone.  That and not having to constantly drive back and forth to help her. I gave notice for my apartment and started to pack. Then she said she would never want me to move home and acted like I imagined it. Thankful my super gave me my notice papeback and said he'd forget I ever gave it to him. Another thing was she repeatedly told me I wasn't pregnant with twins because I wasn't fat. I was like a beached whale lol. I also had ultrasound photos. The babies are 5 months old now and she doesn't care about them at all. It's like they don't exist when she had previously wanted grandkids so badly.  She keeps referring to them as they boy and the girl. As if she doesn't know there names. I read online that dementia can cause lack of intrest in anything 
Do you think I need to put her in a care home? I can't drive constantly back and fourth I don't have time and she's not appreciative when I do come
Or do you think she doesn't like me or the babies?
I'm not sure","Well, does she seem genuinely interested in their lives from time-to-time, or is she consistently disinterested and nasty?  
And have you talked with her doctor about this?
[deleted]
I'm not a doctor, but some of these things definitely ring bells, and it does sound like something isn't quite right. A care home may not be necessary now, but maybe just a doctor visit, just to be safe

It's entirely possible that she doesn't know their names. She might not remember them being born at all, or even your pregnancy. Based on what I've experienced, anything that pulls your attention away from them makes them upset, whether it be eating or sleeping or going to the bathroom (literally anything) so that might be why she's speaking that way about your children. Just a hunch

This is a tremendously difficult situation to be in. Best of luck to you!
Looking back, my Mom started with what I perceived to be personality changes. That was in 2014. She was 80 then and living alone. She just changed. I felt like she didn’t like me. We argued a lot. She was not liking to shower as much. Would go outside to empty the trash in a t-shirt and underwear, no bra, no dentures and become absolutely pissed if I said “Mom, what are ya doing?” It became VERY obvious that she had dementia in 2018 but she was able to function on her own to a degree. She was formally diagnosed in 2020. I’ve been living with her since her diagnosis. The only alternative would be a nursing home. I’m sorry you are going through this. There will come a time when she can’t be alone. Maybe she’s not quite there yet? A neurologist will give her a verbal memory test and order an MRI or some type of scan.  I would try and find a way to communicate with her doctor and maybe he can help come up with a way to get her in for an evaluation. I wish you the best of luck. Just know you are not alone with this.",2021-09-19 19:37:38,Rebecca0626,prj505
Alzheimers,Alz Heimers and COPD. My father is in the final stages of COPD and was just diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. He’s 72. Do you think the COPD could speed up the Alzheimer’s progression?,,"I don’t know for sure so don’t take this as medical advice but I would think that it’s possible due to the fact that COPD restricts the amount of oxygen he can breathe in which limits the amount of oxygen his brain is getting.
Who diagnosed the Alzheimer’s? There is such a thing as oxygen deprivation induced dementia. Unlike most dementia or Alzheimer’s it is reversible if oxygen problems are solved. But that not be possible if copd is that advanced. I’d just suggest getting a second opinion if you haven’t with a specialist as treatments may vary for diagnosis of Alzheimer’s vs dementia due to oxygen problem.",2021-09-19 07:50:48,Selmalove,pr6i2a
Alzheimers,"Grandfather ""escaped"" from memory care facility on his second day.","This past Friday we moved my grandfather to a memory care facility that specifically houses people with Alzheimers and dementia. He was becoming too much for my grandmother to handle on her own. He is still pretty sharp sometimes but he has started wondering off and leaving the house, which is what prompted the decision. 

Well apparently last night he left the facility without the staff even knowing he was gone! He eventually came back inside (thank god) asking where they had parked his truck. In my mind this is completely unacceptable. Another spot opened up at a facility that is closer/nicer but we are worried about moving him to a new place. We don't want to confuse him or upset him more than he already is, but we also want him to be safe. 

I don't have any experience. Is this a common occurrence? Are we overreacting by being outraged?","Memory care units need to be locked. They can use alarm bracelets but a locked unit is the only truly safe place.  My MIL was in an assisted living until recently, she had a wander guard bracelet and constantly cut them off. She was charged $250 for every bracelet.
>Are we overreacting by being outraged?

Not in my opinion. If he tends to wander, he needs to be on a lockdown unit, that takes security seriously. You may want to look at the second facility, and inquire about that.
I hate to tell you this but the care in most of these places is mediocre at best and generally well below the veneer of care/compassion they put forward. 

I moved my father from one place to another once it became apparent that he needed to have better and more individualized care but even the “highly rated” (and quite expensive) place we settled on for the last 18 months of his life was disappointing when I showed up for unannounced/late visits. 

The night shifts in particular are understaffed with a single nursing assistant responsible for an entire floor (approximately 30 residents). 

These places are highly profitable and they don’t get that way by providing anything beyond the bare minimum of care they can get away with. 

If I could’ve kept my father at home, in hindsight, I would have done that instead.
""Dad, now that we've tried this place out, we have an appointment for you to try another one. Which shirt and pair of pants do you want to wear?""  (Distract attention toward an easy task, to  lighten the announcement about a change.)

Avoid explaining your reasons or giving too many details. A matter-of-fact tone works better than pleading, asking his opinion, or asking him if he's OK with the plan. Moving is just what's going to happen next.  Don't make it a big deal; let him know you understand the inconvenience and in spite of that, he's going to like the next place a lot.

I found with my brother (now approaching late-stages) explaining why or giving any details can be stressful, both because of comprehension difficulties and because it triggers alertness (fear) about an upcoming change that they didn't know about. Most Alzheimer's patients live moment to moment and get confused when too much information is coming at them, especially when it has to do with any time other than Right Now --  like future plans or yesterday's visit with Alice.

So avoid over-explaining or trying to get his agreement. He probably will resist, because this is all different to him, but you know there is no other safe option although he doesn't understand that. You have to think for him now, which probably feels really weird (edit: weird to both you and him!)

.... It may take a  week or two, but he'll adjust, especially if the new facility has competent caretakers who understand dementia! They do this professionally and know how to approach, manage, and encourage patients.
I'm sorry you're going through this. Sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right facility.
What if it was winter and he wandered off into a field and froze to death?

You are not overreacting.  This happened to a nursing home near us.

He hasn't been there long, so go ahead and move him.  It will all be part of the same transition.
It happened to my mom twice. The second time, they gave us 30 days to find her somewhere new. What I learned is that while memory care units are locked, fire codes in many areas require a bypass in case of a fire or other emergency where staff may be too panicked to enter a code. In the last place my mom was in, pushing on the door handle 10 times overrides the system. I get the need for the bypass, but I think it's also ridiculous when most every Alzheimer's patient I've seen does push on the door handle trying to get out.",2021-09-19 10:24:29,greeneyedmunster,pr8w4v
Alzheimers,"Father has Alzheimer’s, mother isn’t coping","UK here. Our dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. He’s 71 now and is at the late stage where he can’t wash, dress, toilet or eat independently. He shuffles rather than walks, and will wander aimlessly if given the freedom to do so. His speech has deteriorated in the past year from a couple of words and whimpers to now only a word or two of assent with considerable prompting. He lost a huge amount of weight in the past year and was hospitalised last Christmas for just over a week. When he was released into our mum’s care, he spent days on a hospital bed downstairs, with her looking after him. We honestly didn’t think he was going to pull through, but he gradually did. He has a permanent urinary catheter and has recently started to wear Depends due to some fecal leakage.

Our mum is a nurse, 69 years old, and still works 2 or 3 night shifts a week. She pays local people to stay overnight with dad, but has refused any professional social support services. She lists a number of reasons for this - the cost, the inconvenience, that she doesn’t want strangers in the house - which change from day to day. Dad went into a care home for a few weeks last November whilst mum had an operation, and when he came out he had deteriorated so she is strongly averse to putting him in a home again. She says that it’s the cost, the concern, that she doesn’t know how she’d cope without him, and that she thinks if he was put in a home he’d be dead in 6 months. But she’s exhausted. She’s sleep deprived, angry, concerned, physically in pain, unable to make decisions, and trapped in a cycle of coping for a while, gradually sliding into a complete meltdown, getting a bit of a breather, and then repeat.

We called Social Services last year. She went ballistic. They reviewed things and eventually closed the case as ultimately he wasn’t in grave danger. He was fed and clothed and clean, and there are adults much more vulnerable than him. He remains on a care home waitlist but even if a place came up we don’t think mum would do it.

There are limits to what we (her kids) can do to help due to work, families, etc. We could possibly do more, we admit. But the worse dad gets, the more personal care he needs, and we can’t commit to that. 

Really, this is just a vent. There are no solutions unless mum gives in and gets professional social support. Or ends up dead or physically incapacitated herself (though honestly, we doubt even that would stop her). It’s a mess :(","This is similar to my parents.. Except my mom went into retirement a little earlier than she planned, to take care of my dad full time, and she didn't pay anyone to take care of him at home. Eventually she was ok to send him to day care a few days a week, so she could do stuff like get groceries and such.   She also got him back in worse shape whenever she was forced to have some other facility or individual watch him for more than a day or two, so she really didnt trust anyone else with him. Even his docs would say she was taking such good care of him, but noted it was a double edged sword, and it was almost like she was taking too good care of him.

My moms health did get worse as a result. Blood pressure probs, diabetes, increased drinking, of course stress, all came up for her, but not for him. Shed be depressed, angry, crying hysterically, begging for help, sometimes insisting she didn't need any help, in cycles too.  But she wouldn't let go, and it was clear he was being well taken care of.  So no one could get her to send him to a home. 

I tried to check in often, so she wouldnt feel alone. I reassured her often that if she ever wanted to stop it was ok, even dad wouldnt want her to burn out over it. But because she was the primary caregiver I felt it wasnt my call.  When i visited (once or twice a year), i tried to get things cleaned and fixed, looked at whatever mail or paperwork that needed to be taken care of, tried to troubleshoot her tasks and routines to make them easier to manage. When he finally died, after almost 20 years, it was at home, and we were all there. It took her a bit to mourn but not super long. I pushed her to do social things before and after he died too, like volunteer and do senior sports things, and I think it helped. I wanted to make sure she had some routine that was not revolving around him. Shes actually doing well now. Her health probs she picked up are well under control, and shes got friends and goes out and does stuff. Physically active, learning new things and hobbies, went on  trips. Her docs are now impressed with how well shes taking care of herself. 

Anyway I don't have any advice for how to get your mom to change. I would just say to take good care of her, to make sure she doesn't go down with the ship. Id support whatever she wants to do, and not *force* her, but would encourage and reassure her its ok to ease up and delegate more of his care, but to me its their call. 

Its especially hard now with the covid stuff. I don't know how it is where you are, but she might be giving up more control than can be anticipated if she puts him in a home, because policy and rules seem to change often depending how bad the pandemic is going. 

But its possible for a mom to go through this, and come out ok, maybe a little beat up, but happy, if shes got a good support system for *her.* Good luck.
What do you mean by ""professional social support""?   It sounds like he could use nursing care - catheter duty, bathing, etc.  

You kids could help with the expense.  It would also be nice if one of you would sit with Dad while another takes Mom out for a show or fancy restaurant dinner or trip to a beauty salon.
I'm so sorry you're all in this shitty situation. You're right, there is not much you can do until your mum is ready to accept help. But do get social services involved a bit more (could you convince mum to let them come in the mornings to help him bathe and dress?), ask the GP for referrals and resources in their area, e.g respite, day centres etc, get an occupational therapist in to see what adjustments can be made in the home to ensure dad isn't at risk of falls etc. Find out what help would be available to your mum as a primary carer (there are usually a few charities that offer counselling sessions, for example).

Your mum may be suffering from carer burnout, and at the risk of sounding harsh, if she doesn't look after herself then she's no good to anyone. But it's probably neigh on impossible to make her see that, so be patient with her and be ready to swoop in as soon as she cracks (it will happen). Have initial convos with care companies in the area to get an idea of what they'll do and for how much. 

Are there things you put in place to ease the workload a little? Hire a cleaner? Someone to cook a couple of times a week?

I know it's hard to help someone who's stuck in this vicious cycle, but please don't stop trying - your mum can't see the wood for the trees right now, but I'm sure having her kids as part of her team give her strength.",2021-09-18 08:54:34,treacledor,pqlwok

Alzheimers,Life expectancy for early onset alzheimers?,"Is it different (and how) from regular alzheimers? Looking into internet resources I still don't get what to expect for a person with severe alzheimers at 63 years old.
Wondering if someone has useful/trusted resources to read on this matter?

* I am just trying to prepare myself.","My dad is 71, diagnosed 5 years ago. He can't follow directions, orient himself, or sleep more than three hours at a time. The only baseline is that it sucks.
It is different for everyone.  My mom was diagnosed at 56, 6 years ago and she still drives and works full time.
I have heard that early onset typically progresses faster, but every person is different. You say she already has severe Alzheimer’s? This is a very good resource for understanding what to expect, even if it can’t give you an exact timeline 

https://www.healthline.com/health/stages-progression-alzheimers
It all just so depends.   My mother was diagnosed at 60 with early onset…likely FTD. I’ve heard that early onset most likely isn’t Alzheimers.  I’ve heard of people with early onset living as little as a few years to one lady in KS living 30 years.  Unfortunately, there’s no telling.  My mother lived 13 years with it…she was pretty healthy otherwise.  

The Alzheimers association website is a good place to start.  There’s also the ‘stages’ 1-7 that can help guide you as to what to expect.  Good luck.
Already some excellent answers here. 
One other factor worth knowing with early onset is that diagnosis tends to be later, which can skew the stats somewhat, and make symptom progression seem more rapid. Doctors are less quick to suspect it in younger people, family can be slower to confront symptoms, etc.
My mom was diagnosed 11 years ago and is only now starting to move from stage 6 to stage 7.
My dad has very severe and rapid on set of Alzheimer’s at 63 and he died when he was 69. The first two years of his diagnosis weren’t as bad but we could tell he was declining fast. The last four were hell.  He had primary progressive aphasia and severe behavioral issues. I cared for him until I couldn’t. He was kicked out of 4 day cares, 5 in the house helper quit, kicked out of 2 memory care centers one that specializes in difficult behaviors, went to 2 Geri psych units (one he went to twice so total of 3 stays), and ended up being placed in a state run psychiatric nursing home. Once you’re there, you have no other places to go. It was very sad and very hard. My grandma, (my dads mom) had Alzheimer’s when she was 70. Hers was classic textbook case. She repeated herself and forgot things. She died two months after my dad at the age of 93. They both had testing/ studies done during all of this. My grandma had genetic markers for Alzheimer’s but her biological son (my dad) didn’t. My dad did have an autopsy/ donated to science, they found that he had severe Alzheimer’s and that was his cause of death. I hope this helps. If you need to reach out to me feel free to!
Mom was diagnosed at stage four-ish (couldn't draw a clock) at 66 six years ago. I had to get custody two years ago. She's just now lost her ability to read a sentence or easily sit down in a chair, use a fork, hold any semblance of a conversation. 

Meds can make it worse, diet makes it worse, and it just gets worse. But in reality, we could have several more years with her before she becomes unable to swallow. 

The worst part is constantly readjusting to her behavior, as if we didn't realize she could get this bad. She's pleasant, but communication is really hard. She speaks in meaningless idioms or word salad and thinks I'm her sister. 

No one visits and she doesn't know them anyway. 

Take the time you have with your person as precious and prepare for a long haul of indefinite suffering. There's no silver lining (past a certain point in the disease), in my experience.

Alzheimers,Caregiver - assisted living vs. career advice,"Has anyone left their career to take care of a parent with dementia ?    At what point do you move to assisted living?   My mother is 75 with dementia, heart + kidney issues.  

I have been taking care of my mother now for 5 years and she needs someone to remind her about pills, take to doctors appts, feed her, laundry, etc.    She has several medical issues that often require med changes or doctor visits nearly every week.  She know who I am but gets really confused about most things.  My other sibling has cancer and so I have 100% of care.

Assisted living with in memory care unit will likely cost $3-4k / month.   

Financially I can afford to take a few years off to take care of my mother, and wondering if I am crazy to pause my career to be with her over the next 1-2 years.   I would guess she will have to be in assisted living or nursing home in 3-4 years.","Crazy? No, of course not. You are in a fortunate position. You should do this if you **want** to. Definitely be sure to take care of your mental health as it will almost certainly suffer.
You wouldn’t be crazy for doing this…after it’s all said and done, either way, you’ll find peace with however you chose to navigate it all. 

I sort of did this.  I ran our own business with my abusive ex.  I finally had to leave him for my and my unborn baby’s safety.  I made a deal with my dad to help him take care of my mother while he worked (he couldn’t/didn’t want to retire yet) and I raised my child.  

My brother lived 2 states away and was no help…both he and my dad were in a bit of denial as to how bad she actually was.  The kicker was that they both are/were drs.  She was at home far longer than she should have been for all of our sanity sake. She was even still driving when I came back and I had to be the one to draw the lines.  Over all, I’m glad I did it, and I’d do it again.  

It took a toll on all of us…me, my daughter, and my dad.   Didn’t seem to phase my brother though.  For me, it did socially suck…my “friends” didn’t get how difficult it all was and pretty much ditched me.  But I did manage to meet a wonderful, understanding man and we did marry through all this. Things didn’t turn out good for my dad.  He passed from a heart attack  9 years after her initial diagnosis. He (thankfully? I guess?) died 7 months before my mom and he didn’t have to make the hard end of life decisions.   

My dad did reluctantly put her in adult daycare for about a year and then full time care the year before he and she died.  It was an absolute necessity by that time and was the best thing for all of us.  He should have done it earlier, but the cost was really too much.  For us it was more like $6-7k per month.  We also were paying for dad’s mother to be in full time nursing care at the same place, so double was extremely crushing.  

All in all, you figure out what you can manage and what works best for you and your mom.  I’m sure whatever you do will be the right decision.  You seem very caring and capable.  Good luck!
I have heard of people getting a job in the assisted living memory care center so they could be with their loved one more.
Op-- no you're not crazy.  I took care of my mom for 20+ years.  At first it was just stopping over once a week to help with household chores and meal prep after her heart attack.  Then I sold my house and moved back in with her. She developed diabetes and then alzheimers.  I still worked until the last two years.  I was able to keep her home with the exception of 3 weeks she had to go to a nursing home after she broke her hip. 

I agree,  some of the best memories I have are of the time we got to spend together.  I wouldn't trade that for anything.  

One suggestion is to look into respite care while she is still aware.  Strangers in the house are difficult but while she still understands who you are it will be easier. This will be crucial as the disease progresses.  Caregiver fatigue is real and it can take you to your breaking point.  Utilize any and all resources available. 

I think it's lovely and loving that you want to do this for her.  You're an awesome person.  Just remember to take care of you,  too.
My husband had Huntington’s Disease. I left my job (l worked in the memory care unit at assisted living) to take care of him. Everything you mentioned your mother needs I’ve done for my husband, and of course the residents in my unit. I loved my job, but I don’t regret one minute of leaving it to take care of my husband. Your not crazy for wanting to do this. I think it’s a great idea
Have not left a career to care for a parent but am an only child where both parents were diagnosed with Alz (dad died in 2017). From this perspective, here are a few considerations:

&#x200B;

1. Before quitting your job, please consider hiring a board certified estate planning attorney in your state that can help you navigate the Medicaid system. We did this for dad in Texas and it was a lifesaver because they enrolled him in Medicaid for us which was an outstanding emotional and financial lift (since my parents were both only children). Also, rather than pay the firm an hourly rate, look for a reputable attorney (both from online reviews and most importantly from the State Bar that regulates attorneys in your state so you can confirm if their license is in good standing) that will work for a flat fee. For dad, mom and I had to do all the legwork to gather all the  requested documents for the firm (which was a brutal grind) but the payoff was that the attorneys only charged us about $1,600 to handle everything from start to finish (in 2017) including going to court for us after dad died. In brief, this whole process is too complex to fuss with going it alone.
2. Since your mother needs assisted living care, please have her evaluated now (for free) by the Hospice Care in your area. These programs are typically supported by public and private donations and will help your mother to be evaluated by their staff medical doctor to see if she is within 1-2 years from dying which could allow her to qualify for hospice as well as any housing options they may have to offer. With eternal thanks to a coworker who did this for her dad, we were able to have my dad fully cared for more than the facility could offer after the attorneys got him to a nursing home with Medicaid. His care (since he qualified for both hospice and Medicaid) only cost $350 per month at a nursing home which normally costs $6,500 per month! Regretfully, Medicaid generally does not cover assisted living but you may want to ask your state's health and human services department if there is a Star+Plus Waiver Program that may help to cover any assisted living costs. This is also why it's MUCH easier to just hire the estate planning attorney before doing anything else because doing this alone is difficult even if you're not already a caregiver! One other point: In case anyone's wondering, Medicaid is a reimbursement program (never free money). This means that any money remaining after someone dies will be used to pay back Medicaid with any available funds; however, it's the best system we have to avoid paying these costs completely from our own pocket which most could never afford in the U.S.. See also: #1.
3. Consider hiring a Nurse Case Manager to evaluate your mother. For about $125 an hour, these are licensed RN's (at minimum certification level) who will come to your home and evaluate her and to be in your corner in case something happens. For example, in dad's case, he was taken to the ER when one day he couldn't walk. The ER doctor was going to discharge him to our house (where mom was his primary caregiver) and we tried to explain that the house was neither accessible nor could mom care for him since he couldn't walk and they lived too far away from any in-home care resources. Immediately, we asked the Nurse Case Manager to help and she spoke to the ER doctor and explained to him dad's actual living situation and how it was impossible for him to go home. Because this advice was coming from another medical professional (rather than us), he wisely chose to send dad to a nursing home and he was later transferred to the Medicaid facility once it came through only with help from the attorneys. In total, we paid the NCM's about $600 and it was worth every buck!
4. Are you sure that you can afford not to work if leaving means trying to rejoin the workforce later on? Generally speaking, it seems you won't want to ruin your own financial future as most folks probably can't afford not to work; and, being out for 1-2 years could decimate any savings which can be harder to overcome the older we get. If you're not sure, then consider talking with a licensed Certified Financial Planner in your state (IMHO, it's better to go ahead and pay their fee than to let them sell you financial products and not charge you a fee). In this way, you're dealing with facts and hard datasets based upon your current and projected financial situation (rather than guesswork).
5. For your emotional care and to help your mom, then please know that some states have group care (for example, adult day care) that could allow you to continue working and have a caregiver during the day. In Texas, these are typically more affordable than quitting a job.
6. Across the country, Covid-19 has made dementia care even more challenging as we know because hourly caregivers are never paid enough. This might seem like a good reason to quit your job (and maybe you must); however, I hope these other options may give y'all some respite!
Someone else's story. A nurse left her job to take care of her mother.  Years later the mother dies. The daughter said it was very hard to get back into a nursing position with all that time lost. The technology changed, the protocols changed. Hospitals didn't want to spend the time bringing her back up to speed. She couldn't find a job in her field, became homeless, did various odd jobs, until someone gave her a rent free room. She got into home health care services, and has clawed her way back. 

The big question is, can you take a break in your field of work and come back to it later?",2021-09-16 11:26:34,sportsguyred,ppfhd0
Alzheimers,Recruitment for Alzheimer’s Disease Caregiver Study,"\*\*Need more participants for the study! 

Hello, 

We are part of a research team at the Emory University School of Nursing. Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN, School of Nursing, Emory University, and her colleagues are conducting a study to explore racial/ethnic differences in the attitudes toward Alzheimer’s Disease among midlife women who are family caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer’s Disease.

Currently, we are in the process of recruiting participants to enroll in the study. Please note that this is online-based research and does not involve human contact, so participants are free of COVID-19 concerns. 

We are looking for midlife women aged 40 to 65 years old who can read and write English; who are online; whose self-reported racial/ethnic identity is Hispanic, non-Hispanic (N-H) White, N- H African American, or N-H Asian, and who are family caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer’s Disease. Participants will receive an electronic gift certificate of 20 dollars for filling out the Internet survey and an additional electronic gift certificate of 50 dollars for participating in the additional social media discussion.

Alzheimers,A Good Lunch,"My partner of 25 years has Alzheimer's. I recognized the symptoms three years ago. She doesn't eat well enough. So I try to get her eat. Today, she asked for an specific item, a Southwest flatbread chicken pizza. The problem is that the deli that sells them had pared down their menu and her favorite is no longer on the menu.

But I had to try.

The girl, had years with the company, behind the counter knew the item, and put together an order with the individual ingredients and ""make a pizza"". My partner had her Southwest flatbread chicken pizza for.lunch. She ate her slice with joy. 

My caregiving plan is to keep her safe, healthy, and give her as many happy moments as possible, and this lunch touched all three.","This makes me cry happy/sad tears.  That small kindness meant so much, and we should all behave this way.  My Dad has Alzheimer's, and those small kindnesses when we are out in public mean the world.  I wish you and your partner the best.  This is such a hard thing.
I find most restaurants are happy to oblige. My mom always wanted a BLT, but not everyone had them. When asked though, I never ran into a problem. I always tip extra and back at home go right to their FB page and Google reviews and offer kind words for that reason.
I love this. I have been missing my mom so much lately and reading things like this just makes me smile. 

It is about making them happy. I can't imagine how confusing everything is to them, so a lunch or meal or snack that they love? What is there to lose? My parents never really ate at fast food restaurants a lot...but when she got bad? She wanted Subway! Ha ha ha ha, it makes me laugh even 2 years after she has been gone. 

Many hugs to you OP. Hang on to those happy moments.",2021-09-15 20:58:56,Opinionsare,pp32q8
Alzheimers,Sweet Music Moment for Grandpa,,,2021-09-15 14:03:13,SarahMT12,povfx3
Alzheimers,My Mom has long conversations with people in the middle of the night!,"I hear her speaking to someone and nobody is there, she’s not on the phone. Her voice is strong and clear. She’s laying down with her eyes closed, very peacefully. I don’t know if she’s dreaming or hallucinating. Has anyone experienced this?","Not quite like that, but in my mom's Alzheimer's community, a woman used to sit in the corner on the sofa and talk to an FBI agent in her purse. She would open the purse, put it on the floor between her feet, lean over and talk to the FBI agent about their latest case. I know it was a hallucination, but the stories she spun with that agent were hilarious.

The weirdest my mom did was a bit alarming. I was driving her to her orthopedic surgeon's office and all of a sudden she started slapping at the steering wheel. She kept saying that there was a ""fat, bald guy"" sitting on the dash above my speedometer. I could not get her to stop slapping the steering wheel, so I had to safely pull over and wait for him to go away before I could drive again.
My father-in-law does this. I think it’s a way of processing the day’s events. Almost like verbally dreaming, if that makes sense.
I just experienced this tonight. My grandmother usually watches TV, tonight I found her just laying on the sofa laughing - TV turned off. When I asked her what she was doing the said she was listening to some commentary and shushed me because I was interrupting her. That for me is a hallucination rather than a confabulation. Try speaking to a psychiatrist about what you are experiencing. We had to add an antipsychotic to her treatment. Good luck!",2021-09-15 15:07:06,Nini2935,powo9b

Alzheimers,Anyone else having problems with a POA,"So Mom is stage 7.  I have her POA and am handling Dad's estate.  I have had 2 different financial institutions reject the POA.  It is so frustrating.  One told me I needed a new  one.  If she could handle her affairs well enough to make a new POA she wouldn't need a POA.  The other wants a guardianship.  It says on the first damn paragraph the POA is to avoid a guardianship.  Besides the guardianship system for seniors is riddled with fraud.

I am just trying to take care of my mom.  Why are these people making it so damn hard?","Rules might vary by country, but in Canada I know my mom recently found out that theres a medical POA that everyone knows about, and financial POA thats basically never mentioned.
Your lawyer should be able to figure it out.  Banks are notoriously careful about accepting POAs, as there are many different levels of powers that can be granted within the POA document.  You might try to find out specifically why the first bank rejected it.  Requiring a guardianship is nonsense.

One of the reasons they make it so hard is that they could be sued if they mishandle her money, and there are lots of cases of familial disagreements and misunderstandings (and larceny) around old-people's cash. It's not all bad, but it can be a hassle, especially the first time. Once you get through their nonsense, it will be much easier to deal with them in the future.

One common solution is to just get your name added to her bank accounts.  It's one way to handle her financial affairs with minimal hassle.  Hang in there!  Good luck.
My grandmother only set up medical POA. I think we're too late now to get a regular POA, might have to go guardianship route now. And this reminds me I called Lawyer on Friday and her office hasn't called back yet.
\>>>>>>>Besides the guardianship system for seniors is riddled with fraud.

Is it ever!!!!! Watch the film ""I care about you"" with Rosamund Pike and you'll see just exactly what a money-stealing racket it really is. I can only say if anyone is in danger of needing a guardianship and has lots of money I'd advise to hide that money well because for many professional guardians it is a license to steal. Legally. They'll give your loved one minimum care while they use subtle tactics to divert your money to them or people who work with them. who then get a piece of the action.

Alzheimers,Do people with Alzheimers feel fear?,"Bit of a weird question but when I think of how I would react (I'm a 24 year old guy with a hopefully normal brain) to forgetting someone who is saying they're my son/daughter or other close family member, it would freak me TF out. I'd be hurling questions around trying to understand who this person is and why I don't remember them.

But when I've seen my grandfather go through the same scenario with his children he seemed almost unbothered. He didn't start asking questions or trying to understand who the people in his house were he just sat there and asked his wife who the people were every now and then.

Do people who suffer from Alzheimers forget things so quickly that they don't have time to get scared or do they just loose the ability to think logically and rationally about situations?

I know it's abit of a hard question to answer but any answers are appreciated.","When you say you'd freak out knowing you have Alzheimer's, it may help to know that by a certain point fairly early in the disease, Alzheimer's patients don't know that their reality has changed or that they aren't acting like themselves or thinking clearly. For that reason, they aren't grieving the loss of their intellect or memory the way you and I would as ""normal"" thinkers. It's a blessing for them to be unaware like this. It protects them. 

If they traveled back in time to the way they were when they were ""normal"" and from there looked into the future to see their eventual decline from Alzheimer's, it would be a distressing, scary view -- but when they're in the midst of the disease, they live moment to moment without remembering themselves as they were and without analyzing what's happening. 

Before then, in the earliest stages, they're probably aware that their thinking isn't sharp or  they're forgetting or misplacing things, and it worries them. This may be why they avoid going to the doctor; they want to avoid hearing a diagnosis they fear. 

You and I can monitor our own thoughts as if we're outside ourselves looking in. We can ""think about our thinking,"" recognizing when we're confused or when we don't understand or forgot something -- but an Alzheimer's patient loses that ability. They live moment to moment without perceiving their own cognitive processes, unable to make enough connections to analyze, predict, or control what's happening. They don't know that they don't know, and their sweet cluelessness protects them from the mental suffering and damage to dignity that we worry about. Small blessing, but I'll take it.
My mother (stage 6-7) is and has been terrified. Can't be alone, in the dark, nothing really helps. She has started seeing people despite being on antipsychotics. Just about all she says is ""I'm terrified, help me, help me.""
My mom is at the point where she doesn’t always remember I’m her daughter. She’s never been freaked out when I’ve reminded her. She usually just says “oh right!”

But there was definitely a period where she was freaked out and terrified about other things. When she knew something was wrong and was with it enough to know it might be Alzheimer’s- scary stuff. There was also a period of time where she would have really vivid dreams that she was convinced were real. First one to pop in my mind is she dreamt she went on a walk and came across a man who had been hanged with his tongue cut out. She was traumatized by that but of course it hadn’t actually happened.
Depends on a number of factors; sometimes Alzheimers comes with a big dose of paranoia; everyone's plotting against me, they're sneaking around behind my back, etc. My dad is currently convinced his wife of 30 years is having an affair (she isnt).

There's also different types of fear. I know right now, Dad's terrified of being left alone. He's also become very scared for his friends (he can't track time, so anyone he doesnt see daily seems like they've been gone forever/might be dead)
Yes, they can feel fear.  One reason is they have little control over their lives. They have to follow the rules of someone they may not even recognize. Another reason is things don't make sense or they don't recognize their surroundings.
Depends on the person. My mother kept freaking out thinking that strange men were coming into her apartment and stealing her stuff. She would run down the corridor bothering the neighbors, or call 911 telling them all kinds of crazy things. 

Eventually as she lost more cognition she calmed down somewhat, but still resisted doctor’s appointments and things like that.
Yes they do. My dad was afraid people were trying to kill him, and sometimes me. But its true he never seemed fearful of not knowing who these randos in his house (his family) were. 

But, people with Alzheimer's also do a bit of confabulating: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation which i think requires a *verbalizing* of something false.. But i would think some of the processes (theres lots of theories) behind the confabulating could also be behind the ""normal- looking"" front that Alzheimer's people have sometimes. Im no expert tho.
Unfortunately yes, they can feel fear. Obviously it depends on the person and the stage, but the potential for them to be scared is there. 

As an example, my mum is 64 and was moved into a care home earlier this year. She was diagnosed about 5 years ago (but we suspect that it could have been diagnosed a year or two earlier if she'd been tested). Up until the beginning of this year, she was always aware of her diagnosis and the effect that it had on her and she would sometimes cry about it, which is a perfectly understandable reaction. She still remembered who her close family was, even if she couldn't always remember their names. 

But earlier this year, her condition took a nosedive and she became terrified of her sister, who she lived with. She was convinced that her sister wasn't who she said she was and was looking to harm her and myself. Absolutely nothing would convince her otherwise. I tried showing her pictures of them throughout the years, in case maybe she had it in her head that her sister should have been younger than what she was, but she would freak out at just the sight of the photos. She stopped letting her sister care for her and couldn't even tolerate seeing her in the house, to the point where my auntie had to hide in her bedroom the entire time and sneak in and out for going to/from work. 

I have never seen my mum as scared as she was during this time. She was absolutely petrified and had frequent moments where she was convinced that we had to get out of the house because we were in danger. There were times when I'm sure she was delirious  because she would look and talk to empty spaces as if there was something there, and look at me in horror as her Alzheimer's twisted my words into something completely awful. She would go around the house in a panic and literally start to tear her hair out in frustration and fear.

So yes, people with Alzheimer's can absolutely feel fear, and it can be just about one of the most distressing and heart breaking things to see because sometimes there's nothing you can do or say to calm them down.
I’m a geriatric social worker that specializes in Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia. I have had the privilege of facilitating an early stage support group with people who are in the early stages of dementia. I have gained SO MUCH insight from being apart of this group. They talk about your question. But from what I have experienced, the concern has been about forgetting their loved ones and if their loved ones will be ok after they pass. I have been facilitating an Early Stage Support Group since 2017 and that has been the main fear. I encourage families who are in the early stages to make sure they have all their legal paperwork in order and make sure they have a plan in place for the future. 

Regarding those who are in the middle stage of dementia who are experiencing delusions or hallucinations they absolutely can experience fear - but it’s also possible that they don’t seem to be  bothered by their hallucinations. It just really depends. I once worked with a husband and wife. The wife had dementia and the husband was her caregiver. He would tell me that she would always see people in the house. They didn’t scare  her, but they were more of an annoyance to her more than anything. She would be so annoyed by them because she was trying to figure out how she was going to feed all of them and figure out where they were going to sleep. It was actually a really funny story. Her short-term memory was awful so after about 5-10 minutes she would completely forget about what happened. When she would “see” the people again, it would be like she saw them for the very first time.

I hope this helps! ❤️
It depends on the stage. My mom is in constant fear.
I agree that your toughts that it would likely seem very scary !  I am worried that I might have it and I know that is scary to me.
I definitely believe they can. It not, you wouldn't hear the stories or experience the situations where your parent/loved one walks into a room, sees you, thinks you're an intruder, and pulls a gun, knife, etc. and attacks. My mom broke a nurse's wrist one day when the nurse took hold of her arm and she freaked out.

I believe the answer is a resounding, yes! My mother is afraid to be alone at night. She is also very afraid of falling.",2021-09-14 17:10:24,SomeRandomGuy360,pobqmd
Alzheimers,Fake Group Makes Me So Mad! 😡,"I have an aunt who has dementia (I don't think she is aware but her family certainly is) so I looked around Reddit for a group to get some support and just feel a little less alone. So I looked at one of the groups here, which is titled ""Alzheimer's Group"" and the description says something like ""for people dealing with Alzheimer's to share fun new discoveries in their lives"". 

Upon looking into posts/comments, it became clear early on that it's just a bunch of 12 year olds posting dumb comics and poking fun at Alzheimer's/dementia. I made a comment explaining how frustrated it was and that my aunt probably won't remember my name somewhere down the line and how this is not funny and makes it harder for others to find legit support. They responded ""what you mean this is hilarious"". So I made one more comment, basically feeding the trolls a giant feast. It just makes me so mad. I even pointed them in the direction of a sub specifically for being silly and immature, and pointed out that I'm also subbed to it.

Is there a way to get this fake group taken down based on the sensitive and painful nature of the topic? Has anyone else dealt with similar in that group or others? Thanks.","It's a ""satire"" sub so those are technically allowed. I've had a lot of trolls recently posting that stupid comic here. I'm banning one pretty much every day.
Once in a while a dope who belongs in that sub posts in here. Im just glad if they stay tf out of here.
A while back someone else had a similar experience, so I tried to reason with the mods of that group to change the description to make it more obvious that it's not a real support group. They did update the group description to say ""Serious discussion belongs in r/Alzheimers or r/dementia"" at the end but if you don't know where to look it's easy to miss. I tried to figure out how to report it to the Reddit overlords as well but they really don't make it easy.    


Unfortunately, as long as they keep to themselves, I don't know if there's much we can do about them.  When we had a bunch of shmucks from another sub posting an offensive meme over here from a different sub, I was able to get in touch with that sub's mods and get them banned, since they were violating rules by posting over here.

  
What I've discovered from dealing with the trolls from these groups is that they're either oblivious to how cruel and insensitive they're being, or actively reveling in causing others suffering.

The other mods here have done a great job of approving relevant posts and removing offensive ones, and we'll keep trying to be vigilant for people who try to actively harm this community.

In the meantime, I'll reach out to that group again to remind them of civility and explore if Reddit can do anything about them.  If you're able to DM me any records of the post and what happened to you, that could help as well.
I saw that too, looking for help with Alzheimer’s, find a bunch of Garfield comics. Like, WTH?",2021-09-14 18:31:28,JillyMarie1987,pod998

Alzheimers,"Grandmother was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Dad not handling it well","Looking for advice on how to be supportive to my dad while he navigates his mom being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

In the beginning of this year, my grandmother was diagnosed and my dad is having an extremely difficult time navigating it. We were all together this weekend and when my grandparents left, my dad had a breakdown saying she's not the same and this person isn't his mom. You can imagine how heartbreaking this was to see and I just hugged him not knowing the right words to say. :( I could really use advice on how to be supportive to him as he goes through this, this was the first time he opened up to my brother and I about the toll it is taking on him emotionally.

My grandmother was always an extremely happy person, one of the greatest joys of my life. She now frequently gets angry and grumpy, and often times forgets about her diagnosis and will call my dad or aunt and ask about it. This is all truly gut-wrenching. I would greatly appreciate any advice you might have to offer","I'm sure you know, but there's a really tough road ahead. Constant temper swings, confusion, non-sense - all normal behaviour will eventually go out the window. It's going to be very important to remember that her actions are solely the result of her disease and not her being willfully difficult or nasty. You'll be giving her your best care because of the woman she was throughout her life, not what Alzheimer's will reduce her to. As for advice, I often try to remember or write down the memories where my dad was at his best. It helps to sustain me through his (and my) most difficult times. Truly wish you the best of luck through this. Feel free to DM me if you want to hear some of the strategies I've used to adapt our relationship.
I'm not sure how much advice I have for you, Alzheimers is something that needs to be endured. He will go through his process, best way to help is to be there when you can and help with the simple but tedious things like giving care takers a break from having to always watch grandma. 

My dad has it, his mom had it before him. I saw what it did to my grandmother and knew my dad wouldn't really be there anymore in a short while, so in essence I said my goodbyes early, at least internally.  my dad is still around but it's not him anymore, but I still take care of him and comfort him, but my relationship has changed, partially to protect myself emotionally from the long decline that is ongoing.
I'm sorry for the situation you and your dad are in. Alzheimer's is a cruel disease.

Encourage your dad to talk to you about how he's feeling; better yet, encourage him to seek help from a therapist or at the least a local Alzheimer's association (google them).  If your dad only feels comfortable talking to you, make sure you have ways of looking after yourself - the stress of watching a parent (and grandparent) go through this is incredibly hard.

Quick suggestions off the top of my head - give your dad a ""day off"" every so often, and look after your gran, so your dad can have a break without worrying whether your gran is okay.  Likewise, try to help out by doing some shopping, cleaning etc, so he doesn't have to always think about all the things he has to do.

Don't try to tell him you know how he feels - yes, you're going through this too, but it's your gran, not your parent.  It's a really different situation.  

Do lots of research about what to expect in the future.  Each person's alzheimer's journey is different, but it's good to have an idea of what to expect.

When your gran gets cranky, try to distract her. Try to remember that a lot of her behaviour is coming from frustration and fright. Part of her recognises her behaviour as 'not normal' and this must be so scary for her.

Along the same lines, if your dad ever snaps at you unreasonably, or is generally short-tempered, try to keep in mind what's going on for him and how stressed he is about everything - maybe cut him a bit of slack and try to be more forgiving/understanding.

Brainstorm with your dad about things you can give your gran to do, so she feels useful - maybe give her a bundle of papers, and ask her if she has time to put them in date order, or sorting buttons into sizes or colours.  (Doesn't matter if she gets it right or not - the point is she feels she's being useful).  

I'm not sure how old you are, or what level your gran is at - but hopefully you may be able to take some suggestions from this and other posts.

Give your dad lots of cuddles - you don't even have to say anything, just let him know you love him.

Best of luck with all that's coming xxx
I care for my 90 yr old MiL and at times I’ll admit it’s been very hard. (I’m retired but my wife still works.) I think one of the biggest hurdles many carers must face is the sense of frustration followed by guilt. You and he just have to remember that any upsets will be forgotten within minutes by your nan and you and your father must try to forget it too and move on.

It’s absolutely true too that despite what he thinks part of her character still exists in there and anything to bring that out helps fight off the all too prevalent depression she will undoubtedly suffer. Very often her anger and grumpiness will be a direct result of her condition. It’s not personal. It’s often simply frustration. For you nan and your father. Try to imagine being told that you’ve lost x number of years of memories or that someone is saying they’ve already told you something umpteen times, even though you would swear in a court that they haven’t. It’s also important not to continually correct her if she says something that you all know to be wrong. Just agree and move on. She’ll have forgotten it within minutes anyway.

Others are absolutely correct with the advice to keep your nan occupied with tasks or little puzzles and games and maintaining her independence for as long as possible is paramount.

I don’t know where you’re based but I also have to say without the fabulous support we’ve received from The Alzheimer’s Society (UK) I don’t know how we would have coped over the last 2 years. I for one have definitely learned a heightened sense of respect for carers, paid and unpaid, particularly those family members who are trying to cope alone.

I wish you and your father well and please pass on the message that he is not alone. There are day centres for occupational activities and care homes that will offer temporary respite all available or reopening now.
All the best.

I’ll add onto some of this as I’ve experienced this with both of my parents now. 

The first thing is that your entire family is going to be walking through this sort of distorted “fun house mirror” of life for quite a while.  Things will be volatile and emotional because it is terrifying for your grandparent and parents.  The past will get framed and reframed in ways that will be uncomfortable and any old tension or secrets will likely be unearthed by this emotional earthquake.  I’m sorry to have to say it but like I said I’ve been through it twice. 

Your parent will want to protect you as I did with my son.  I didn’t want him to have to bathe his grandmother after she messed herself and to have to see her naked and confused like that. My son was angry that I pushed him out at those times but we’ve talked as adults and he’s since understood (even if he disagrees).  Giving your parent a break to just take a walk or see a movie without guilt will be a great help. 

Your parent is also likely scared that they are looking at their own future in front of them. I can tell you from personal experience that such fear is never far away once “Al” is part of the family. 

Now I will give you some good news.  In my mother’s case, once she got through the initial shock and fear and anger, that we shared a lot of joyful moments.  Her genuine delight of seeing me come through the door every time made me feel such love.  Telling her about the good things (college and grad school degrees) or promotions or even getting remarried made her so happy no matter how many times I told her. 

Or even watching cartoons or old tv shows from her youth have her so much joy. 

The one piece of advice I can give is that you can engage with your grandparent in their world/space/reality.  You don’t have to reorient them to ours.  It’s exhausting to try to do so and it won’t work.  Just focus on their comfort/peace/security and you’ll be surprised that you may find some silver linings in the dark clouds.  

Take care.
There has been some great advice here and I have a bit to share as well.  My mom died with Alz.  My mom was my hero & we were very close.  She was married twice.  I was the only child from the 2nd marriage.  Both her husbands' had passed.  My mom was dissappearing before my eyes and it hurt.  I was afraid.  I could look straight at her in the face needing her normal self and she wasn't there.  I'm sure your dad is experiencing this.  Over a period of 2 years, I grieved my mother's death even tho she had not died.  I could talk to her on the phone & it just wasn't the same.  I cried & cried over my mom before she ever took her last breath.  At a point, my mom forgot me.  People with Alz loose memories that r recent.  They can recall very old memories like when they were children.  My mom went back ""in her mind"" to her 1st marriage.  I didn't exist.  This was very hard for me.  I learned alot & had many talks with my siblings that might not have happened otherwise.  That was good.  I chose to be her friend because I desperately needed a role in her ""new life"".  As hard as it was, I had new adventures with my mom.  Wherever she ""was"" I went with it.  One day we were working together cleaning houses.  She made me laugh when she said, we needed to quit this job cuz this place is a mess.  Another day we were kids going to pick grapes.  Once I was done grieving loosing my mom, I was able to accept what was happening and just roll with it.  I too reached out to the Alzheimer's chapter.  They were wonderful.  Contacting a social worker to help provide routes for assistance was helpful.  Our church helped alot giving me a few hours break.  I am here if your dad needs to talk.  I understand.",2021-09-13 17:56:16,Mediocre-Gazelle-930,pnpdl4
Alzheimers,"Is there a phone that I can purchase that can be ""hung up"" and ""answered"" remotely?","Hi,
My mother has moderate dementia. My father is taking good care of her, but every once in a while he just needs to get out of the house, which means my mother is alone for a few hours.

Lately, when I phone it's about a 50/50 chance that she will be able to answer the phone correctly and she often doesn't know how to hang up the phone either.

So... I'm wondering if there is a phone that would allow me to:

* call

* AND remotely answer for her.

* then allow me to hang up for her.

That's probably a tall order, but if anyone knows the answer, they're probably on this sub.

Thank you.","We had this same problem with my mother-in-law. What we did was set up an old iPad on an arm mount near her chair (where she spent most of her waking hours). There’s an auto-answer setting (General > Accessibility > Call Audio Routing) that when turned on allowed us to FaceTime to the iPad and just start talking with MIL. At first she didn’t like doing video calls so we just did audio-only FaceTime calls. But she eventually got used to talking to us via video. Once she became bedridden, we had the iPad mounted on her bed frame and it really helped. We even had the grandkids call in, which she really liked.
I got an Amazon echo show for this- you can “drop in” anytime, plus it’s got video. Game changer for me, since my mom usually doesn’t hang up the phone correctly and has occasionally turned the ringer off.
Spectrum has something included in their phone service (voice zone) that does it. I have routed all of my parent's landline through my phone because my father will not stop answering phone calls.
I have 0 experience with these kinds of products. But they look pretty good. 

https://familymattershc.com/video-communication-devices-for-elderly/

I saw at least one in there that has an auto answer feature, and is secure - only for authorized users like family to contact the senior. That looked pretty neat.

If you get one, i hope youll post a review hehe.
It's a long-shot, but I have Comcast Business phone for my home office. I can have calls that are not from specific numbers forwarded to another number. I use it to forward calls from my mom's memory care community, my doctor and dentist, and my family members to my cellphone and all others are required to press 1 to leave a message. That ""press 1 to leave a message"" ended almost all spam calls.
Hi! I’m what we did for my mom is purchase a wyze cam from Amazon for $20. We can see what she’s doing in her room and use a two way microphone to talk to her.
I have a View Clix for my mom. It's a tablet screen you can set up that shows photo slideshows of pictures you can upload from an app. You can also use the app or a browser to call via video. The only people with access are the ones you send an invite to. Don't have to pick up anything to answer. once you are done, phone hangs up and photo stream comes up again. You can also leave post it notes on the screen, and upload photos instantly to the device. We used it through the pandemic, and it was a godsend for me.",2021-09-12 18:49:51,1-800-AVOGADRO,pn2ztj
Alzheimers,Eating problems,My grandmother has alzimers and she refuses to eat.  Not only that but she doesn't recognize me anymore so that doesn't help when trying to get her to eat.  Any ideas of what to do?,"Just let her know that you are there to help her. You don't need to try to get her to recognize you. Just assure her that you are there to take off her.

I would try meal replacement shakes like ensure. Tell her it's chocolate milk. My dad does best with a straw, but we have to use metal ones because he chews on the plastic. 

You might need to try foods easy to swallow and handle. Dad doesn't do well with sandwiches because they can fall apart. We also have to guide his hand to the food because he'll forget. Sometimes we will load up the spoon or fork and hand it to him, then he'll place it in his mouth. 

Just try various things. It's kind of like dealing with a baby. They can't communicate so you have to figure it out.
We make hot chocolate with vanilla boost, milk and Swiss Miss packets. On the rate times my grandmother wants a milkshake at home, we can use the vanilla boost instead of milk.
There are specific techniques that help an Alzheimer's patient eat. Teepa Snow is an expert on caring for dementia patients and she often explains their difficulties and demonstrates ways to help.

My wife and I have a similar problem with my MiL. We’ve been told this terrible disease plays havoc with the taste buds so consequently some things won’t taste the same. Therefore sufferers more often than not prefer sweet things.

One thing she does like to do is graze too so we leave packets of sweets like jelly babies and werthers around for her to dip into all day and ensure there are plenty of cakes, crisps and biscuits available. We also just make her a sandwich but cut it into quarters and leave it covered with cling film in the fridge. I also find she’s more inclined to eat if we eat with her.
Hope this helps.",2021-09-10 23:41:41,ke3t,plzzer
Alzheimers,Mom diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s,"It’s almost been a year since my mom was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. She was diagnosed in September 2020 and was 53 at the time. Prior to all this, she was diagnosed with cancer in July of 2014 which then became terminal. I was 12 when she got cancer and was 18 when they diagnosed her with Alzheimer’s. We recently got an assistant (??) to help with her since my dad is the main provider for us and she would always bother him and could barely get any work done. It’s been extremely hard and frustrating because she’s just so difficult. I know it’s not her fault and she doesn’t mean it but we’re both combative at each other and I lose my patience very easily so we don’t have the best relationship. I feel like an awful daughter because I shouldn’t act like this but her personality isn’t the best either.

What makes it worse is she’s like a walking corpse. She’s physically here but not mentally and I can’t imagine how that feels. I feel like I don’t even have a mom anymore and seeing my friends moms talking and just doing normal things hurts so much. My mom can’t drive, make food, take a shower on her own, get dressed, read, understand people telling her to do things, or speak a normal sentence anymore. I’m just rambling at this point but I just feel so unbelievably lost","You are not an awful daughter.  Please be gentle with yourself... this disease is literal hell.
Know you are not alone in feeling this way.  You’re very young and I’m doubly sorry this is happening.  I was 30 when my mom was diagnosed with early onset, but it had taken her away earlier than that.   What helped me was having an older woman who basically adopted me as her other daughter.  She already had 4 adult children…what’s one more? I was/would be totally lost without her. 

Usually there are support groups…maybe even find one online.  That may help.  I wish you well on this journey.  It isn’t easy, but eventually, there is peace.
I really really understand how you feel. Honestly the thing that helped me most was therapy. I felt a lot of the emotions you describe and eventually just sort of snapped - looked into a therapist that same day. It sort of became my hour every week to vent and cry about the situation. She also helped me come up with some coping solutions when I feel overwhelmed which was great. 

So sorry you’re going through this - especially at such a young age. I was about 23 when my mom was diagnosed and it sucks.
I feel the exact same as you. My mom was diagnosed this past July at 63, I'm 31. Everything you feel is valid, sending you love!
I was creating a post to cry out this situation. My mom has been diagnosed with early on set alzhemer 7 years ago.   
Now, she's not my mom anymore. She's a completely different person that makes me cry everyfucking day of my life, because I can't leave her with my father by himself. It's so many stuff, i already have ptsd for 2 months in the hospital due to an EXPLODED appenditis, peritonitis, cardiac arrest. I saw my MOTHER 2 months almost 24/7 wake up, Even when I was in a coma in the UTI she never left the hospital just waiting these 15 minutes everyday. Now she has 50, and she's a person, a functional EVIL person. I can't stand it, i wanna die everyday.",2021-09-10 10:22:05,ThrowRA_idkwhat2doo,plm17z
Alzheimers,"Went and saw my nan for the first time in over a year yesterday, it was heartbreaking","My nan has alzheimers, she’s the sweetest soul and last time I saw her she was perfectly standard - infact she hates that in her care home she’s the only mentally well (? - idk if thats the phrase) one there.

I saw her for the first time yesterday since COVID (so over a year), and her health has gone massively downhill.

She forgot my name, forgot my brother existed (he hasn’t seen her for nearly 3 years but I reminded her of it) and she kept saying how everyone thinks she’s guilty because she killed the head carer’s grandma but she know she’s not guilty but she’s being made to suffer (when she told me she was being made to suffer I had to pry it out of her and she still wouldn’t completely tell me- its definitely not the care home). She says the voices in her head laugh when she’s suffering and if she’s not suffering it upsets them. Her speech has also gone downhill (going from mumbling to mouthing words to talking normally)

She refused to go to the toilet because they want her to suffer. She even asked me to leave (which my nan would never do).

I told my Dad everything and he said he’s going to see how she is when he sees her in a couple of days. He said he’s going to get into contact with my uncle to let him know that the nana we once had is no longer there.

Honestly heartbroken, she’s 84 and I don’t want her to forget me, I don’t want her to go but we don’t know how long she has left","Waaa, so sorry to hear that, it's very sad.  These covid times of no visiting certain facilities has been very heartbreaking.   Yeh, we never know how long anyone has left.  Sad.   :(",2021-09-09 13:44:30,starconstellation,pl2phf
Alzheimers,Mom is more confused and paranoid,Didn’t know how to handle a situation this morning. Mom has a yorkie we’ve been waiting weeks to get groomed. I had her looking a pictures because she didn’t like his last cut. She decided all the pictures were scams and they didn’t have dogs and a bunch of other things and refused to let me take the dog to get groomed. I didn’t handle it well. I had a headache and was feeling irritable. But I didn’t even know how to get around this,"Sometimes, you won’t be able to. The best thing you can do is roll with the punches, drop the subject, and bring it up again the next day. She may have forgot all about her original answer.

Be grateful she’s  still around. Enjoy her better days. Laugh when you can. I am grateful I did this. My mother is end stage now, and probably won’t last the rest of the month. I would give a lot for one or two more good days.
When my grandfather was getting to stage 4. It scared me. He never got angry. Like I had never heard him raise his voice. One day he asked to play chess(he taught me how to play) and although I was making the right moves he abruptly ended the game and told me “if you are going to cheat then we won’t play” That’s when i knew that it was bad. I’m praying for you. I just lost him this past friday. Try to have as many laughs with her as you can.
Honestly, I lie a lot. We had to take my mom's dogs away. Her doctor felt she was okay living alone as long as we had cameras and someone spent the day with her cooking meals, and we disconnected the gas to the stove. So we tried that for a while. I would spend the day, cook meals, and leave after her dinner to go cook for my kids and husband. I'd watch her take the dinner I cooked her and feed it to her dogs. They were getting everything, including chocolate, coffee, and onions.

At that point, we had to take her dogs away from her. We told her they were just at the vet getting their rabies shot. She knew that was important. so she was okay with it. When she'd ask again, we'd repeat the story. I had one dog living with me, and the other was living with another sibling, so we could make them reappear for visits, but then they'd go to the vet again. She never remembered it to question us on our lies.

I wouldn't tell your mom you're taking to get her dog groomed. I'd make up an excuse and go do it.
I’m so sorry for your loss.  My mom and I have had a good relationship after I wasn’t a teenager anymore. But she often would say things before thinking how it might make the other person feel. She’s quite opinionated. Most of the time I just let it go and make excuses to others about her not having a filter sometimes. Today it really bothered me the way she spoke to me and she has really been out of sorts all day. I think I felt afraid that she is going to start moving to the next stage
Her saying that the pictures were scams makes me think she may be having psychosis related to her condition. I'd make sure to bring it up with her doctor and keep an eye out for other delusions or hallucinations.  

As for how you deal with it, the other suggestions here are great and the answer is probably a combination of them. If she were to claim something completely wrong again - birds don't exist - I'd say, ""Well that's interesting"" and change the subject (or activity, location; whatever works). That way you're not fighting the delusion but you're not encouraging it either. Hopefully that keeps her from getting agitated or aggressive. In this particular example something like, ""If they're scams then let's put them away and have a snack. Let's go to the kitchen and pick something out.""

Best of luck to you and your mom!
Would a mobile pet groomer offer a solution or would that be upsetting to have a stranger come to the house/driveway? 
Are you able to get your mother into the car with you and take her along? Calling ahead to explain your mother's health could be really helpful for an employee to know to approach her calmly and cheerfully and to spend a little extra time to explain what is happening.

The way I see it, almost every adult has experienced a loved one with dementia or is at least aware of what it does to people. And most are more than happy to help out even in small ways.",2021-09-08 17:01:18,NanaDof4,pkj4c4
Alzheimers,"Back wall neighbour has Alzheimers, we're worried about her","Me and my wife live in a condo sharing a back wall with this kind little lady who we've always maintained a good relationship with. Over the last year, we've noticed a switch in her temper, she's become much more quick to anger, and her usual old lady forgetfulness was becoming more common and on more significant details. I got my first hint of something wrong when I noticed her dinner table covered in post-it notes and reminders.

Fast forward to yesterday and her grabbing me in the parking lot to show me her old wedding pictures, but confusing her wedding with her sister's. We invite her over for dinner, and she re-asks the same questions three times over the course of the meal, repeatedly expresses surprise that my wife has an accent (she's American), and when discussing the health care system differences between both countries, asks with genuine interest if the United States are a developed nation (don't worry, we held back the many jokes that came to mind at that moment). More importantly, she recounts an anecdote where she yelled at the pharmacist for writing on her pill bottles ""For Alzheimer's"", which made her incredibly angry, because she says she has a bit of a depression, not Alzheimer's, and she won't have anyone implying that her occasional memory lapses are Alzheimer's, she finds the idea insulting.

So, we're worried about her. We're not extremely close, we're just friendly neighbors, but we know that her family situation isn't the best. She's not on excellent terms with her only remaining daughter, which she accuses of only wanting her money; she has one sister she's still in touch with, and she accuses her of scheming with her father when they were kids to have her put in an orphanage. Don't know how much of these is true, she does show some signs of paranoia and seems to make up or mix up stories a lot. We want to make sure she has a proper support system in place and people to rely on when the Alzheimer's gets really bad, even though she's extremely hostile to the idea of a retirement home. We also obviously want to make sure she doesn't become a danger to herself, or others around her. We've been periodically bringing her food to store in her fridge and freezer because we know she only eats convenience store meals at the moment. But as her situation progresses, we don't know how much help she's going to need, and we're not even in a position to provide that help as we're going to be moving before long.

Would it be too nosy to contact her sister, or daughter, to see if they're aware of the situation and can take care of her? Especially considering that she certainly wouldn't want us to get in touch with either of them? It's a pretty delicate situation to be sure, and me and my wife are both unsure what to do, or whether we should even get involved, ethically speaking.","Absolutely call her family. And if they don't respond immediately then call your local adult protective services.
Yes. What kippy236 said. Thank you for noticing her and caring.
I called adult protective services for my neighbor. And then told her daughters they were involved. It seemed to help get people interested in being involved.
In the US, I would say contact the aging and disability resource center for her, or adult protective services, and let them start getting her involved in their services.

I don't know how that works in your system, and even in the US, the results can vary widely depending on location.

Many times the only way an elderly person gets placed in a residential facility is by breaking a bone or something; the hospital will not discharge her to home, she goes to a nursing facility ""till she recovers"" and never leaves again.  It's sad that it has to go that way, but that's USA.  (Go ahead with your jokes, they are probably earned!  I sometimes wonder if we are a 'developed country' too!)

Ethics stops mattering (somewhat) as a person's dementia progresses.  If you have a way to contact family members, I would - but how are you going to get their contact information?
It is not nosy. It is community safety. And I say this as someone who let her mother live on her own for far too long because she was also hostile to assisted living (and who also insists she just has memory problems, not alzheimer's.)

You share a back lot with her. You're lucky that she's only eating convenience store meals because she could burn her house down if she got ambitious enough to cook. (We had to disconnect mom's oven.)

Contact the sister and daughter first, then her doctor - she's likely doing her best to conceal how advanced the disease is. Relay your specific observations & have some action items. Sometimes family is paralyzed about what to do next because they know how much the person will hate it. There is undoubtedly some tension, but her characterization of their relationship dynamics may not be valid. Here's some thing you can suggest or ask about:

* It might be good to do a home safety check where a trained practitioner comes to their home for a check-up and observes the setting & risks in her home environment.
* Go with her to the bank & do a joint finance/check-in meeting with them. If your country is even a little bit like the U.S. she's a prime target for scammers posing as service providers, charities, or utilities.

If the sister/daughter don't want to get involved, that's their choice. But let them know you're concerned for her safety and will be getting in touch with her doctor. The doctor will likely be required to report her to adult protective, based on what you've described. It's an unfortunate situation, but it is more ethical to do something than nothing in this case.
She'll need professional care, and if she's alone trying to take care of herself, she may decline faster because of nutrition deficits, lack of routine, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and fear. She may be avoiding medical attention because she's in denial about her condition (much later on, she won't be intellectually able to think about her own condition enough to deny it; she'll just live it without knowing it's happening.)

IMO, it's not too nosy to contact relatives, because her safety is at risk and therefore becomes an appropriate concern! As a neighbor, you're someone who sees her more frequently than anyone else. Her family has no other way of knowing about the changes if they're typically  distant. She isn't likely to tell them herself, since she's resisting the reality of her condition.

Additionally, it's worth looking into ways your local government helps the elderly. In the U.S., every state and county has an Office of Aging through the public health department that can provide resources, information, and professional help. Organizations such as Meals On Wheels deliver meals, for example. Wherever you live (I'm guessing UK?), perhaps there is a similar official bureau or government department that will do the same.

Thank you for caring!  Btw, my brother has Alzheimers (now he's in later stages and in a memory care facility). He started out with almost the exact same symptoms as your neighbor -- sticky notes everywhere, repeated stories, denial of anything wrong. If you want to learn more about Alzheimer's, I highly recommend watching videos by Teepa Snow, like [this one](https://youtu.be/mkRvK26bkTQ) in which she explains what's happening in the brain that causes the changes in behavior.
This makes me so sad having just losing my grandmother to Alzheimer's. My grandmother was at least loved and cared for up until her last days. I can't ever imagine having her to go through what she did alone. I would try to call her family or some sort of service that can help. You are good people.
You are doing the right thing by contacting her family. She’s lucky to have you as a neighbor.",2021-09-08 09:44:14,Grushvak,pkasg4
Alzheimers,My dad was just diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.,"I'm equal parts angry, scared, and sad all at once. He's only in his 50s, I'm only in my 20s, it all just feels entirely too soon. I don't know what to do.

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for your kind words of advice and nuggets of wisdom. I freaked out a little bit at first and now that I’ve had some time to read up on Alzheimer’s and talk to my parents I’m a little less frantic. It’s still a weight on my shoulders but you’ve all given me the realization that this is just another curveball in life, another cross to bear. We have tons of family photo albums and home videos that will keep him young in our minds and in his. And my parents recently retired and downsized houses so they have more time to spend together. It sucks knowing what will eventually happen, and my dad is still in a bit of denial, but we’ll confront it together. Thank you all. I imagine I’ll be here quite a bit in the future, so see y’all around.","Happened to me a few years ago, although older than your situation.  It made me sad.  Since then some days are frustrating, I’m his caretaker now.  Most days are ok, some are good.

Sadly, Covid has made it so he doesn’t get to enjoy these days as much as I wish he could, but I just let him know he’s going to be cared for and that I love him.  I keep trying to remember that as sad as it makes me to be losing my parent, it is happening to him and he needs more comfort and kindness than me.

Good luck.
Enjoy every single moment with him you possibly can. Be as patient as you possibly can. And don’t forget that it’s normal to get overwhelmed and down right frustrated at times. And if it comes down to you being a caretaker do not be afraid to ask for help.
I really get ya. My mom was diagnosed with early onset when she was 61 or so and I was like 23. It’s not fair at any age but man did I go through a period where I was so sad and angry about it. Do you have other family? Another parent in the picture?
Been there. Big hugs. It sucks. I'm sorry.
You'll need some practical support. Groups like Alzheimer's association and aarp have free support groups and and educational classes.. Alzheimer's assoc had in person meetings but now bc covid they are online. But that could help you bc it could make it easier for you to find an ""early onset"" or ""younger onset"" support group. Additionally, i would recommend you find a group that is specific to your area, because resources can vary by county. Heres a place to start: https://www.alz.org/help-support/community/support-groups

You could also try and check if there are state and county offices for elderly affairs, elder care, or similar, to see if they have resources for you. Unfortunately, some of the resources may have an age requirement. But, in some states there are govt  offices to address ""dementia"" which may not have an age requirement. Id take a stab at calling one, and if its a miss, ask them if they can recommend any other office to try. 

Theres some legislation to get more help to ppl affected by younger onset:  https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/small-bills-would-spell-big-wins/ar-AAMfOM7. I know that the Alzheimer's association AIM section was involved with some legislation like this in [2019](https://www.alz.org/news/2019/younger-onset-alzheimer-s-disease-act-of-2019-intr) but i don't know if they still have a role. Id ask your local Alzheimer's association if theres things like this you should be aware of that could benefit you. 

Finally, maybe after making contact w an early/younger onset support group in your area, id find out if looking into things like getting help with elder law or elder care financial planning would be helpful to you. If theres a local law univ sometimes they have clinics and programs that can help. Or maybe you could see if there are other kinds of planning you should look into (like learning about power of attorney, getting a handle on any of his accounts and passwords, etc). 

This is a hard hand you have been dealt. Try to get in as much quality time as you can. Record your happy times with him maybe, with pics and videos. Try to find out what his fav music is/was esp from when he was younger. I wish you the best, good luck.
I am so sorry.  This is way too soon.  If you can, join groups (FB has some good ones that are quite active) to hear what others are doing to manage.  My dad was diagnosed at 61, so it's been several years now for me.  You'll need support, please seek it out early.  I would be happy to talk if you would like.
Power of attorney
I’m in the same boat. It’s superlatively difficult to write and admit all this, but my mother, who’s in her early 60s, is struggling with the same situation. Everything seems so bleak and I’m just so lost.
That’s how it was with me and my mom. In just 3 years she’s drastically declined and different. It’s best to spend and love each moment you have with them in each stage they go through.
I’m sorry. Be sure you get to have the hard discussions while you still can and get all of the ducks in a row. Then enjoy the time you have.
I'm so sorry and wishing you all the strength to keep your mental health in place.
One thing to do as fast as possible if it is not done yet, get the legal stuff in place. In English it is Power of attorney I believe.
My mom is 63 and her mind is almost completely gone, so she's in no mind to sign any legal stuff. Her money and real estate cannot really be handled by her or me at the moment and in my country it is pain in the a** to get this fixed once it is too late.
Best if luck to you.
This happened to me at the beginning of covid when I was 19 and my Mom was 58. I’m here to talk if you ever need, I know how rough the bad moments are. The other comments here are great advice too
Went through this with my mom, early onset is incredible difficult. You will get scared, you will get frustrated. Just remember the person you love is in there, they are just lost. I hope you get lots of good days.
I’m sorry you have to go through this. I feel like I am you, ten years from now. 

My dad was diagnosed in his 50’s and i was in my 20’s as well. He’s now in his late 60’s and all but gone. I have lots of pictures but only voicemail that I saved of his voice…

The “silver lining” is this: everyone loses their parents at some point. No one gets out of here alive. Some of my friends lost their dads when they were children or teens and all they have are a few photos and memories. You have the opportunity of advanced knowledge and the chance to make something to remember him by. 

Record videos of him now. Ask him questions of his life and record his answers. Enjoy what you have now. 

It’s hard to comprehend right now, but when you’re on this side, you will cherish the time and memories…and videos of him.  

All the love I can possibly send your way.
My mother got diagnosed earlier this year, though we expected it and began the process of diagnosis about a year before. She's only 59, I'm 27 myself. 

&#x200B;

Even though we knew it was coming the diagnosis hit like a brick wall and totally destroyed me. I'm slowly building myself back together and learning to live with it. This is definitely a disease that absorbs everyone into it, not 'just' the victim.

I'm happy to talk about anything and everything, it can be a lonely place to be in.",2021-09-07 19:29:59,ThatSpartanKid,pjyowj
Alzheimers,My mom shit herself tonight. That was always going to be my hard stop limit.,"But I still had to clean it up and clean her up because she didn’t know what to do. And then I vomited and it was awful. Oh and there was a huge mess on the floor that needed to be cleaned in the bathroom on top of everything else. Plus the laundry I now am having to do. 

I have three different candles and two air purifiers running in my apartment. 

She is full time in disposable underwear for the past month because she started wetting herself and stopped wiping herself. As much as she wants to hate me for making her wear them, I know I’m right. And they still don’t save me from the fact now that she’s decided she doesn’t regularly have to use the toilet anymore. She peed her bed four times in the past week even with the disposable underwear. And every single time, it is at 7:00 am, which is exactly when I’m supposed to be online and clocking in for work. But no, I’m having to strip the bed, or mop the floor, get her into the shower and clean everything up. I’m so tired of it. 

And now we are really at my literal shitty nightmare and I can’t do anything about it other than pray it’s not a common occurrence, until I can finally get her in memory care. I’m working on it, but it is so overwhelming starting to search and the finances of it all is terrifying. She has a settlement she recently was awarded, and that is helpful, but it’s going to run out so fast. I guess my whole plan of putting it in a trust and thinking we could get enough assistance without having to spend it all first is not as attainable as I thought.

She had a UTI last week and started believing that I wasn’t her daughter, that she had a different one, and I was suddenly in her life like some sort of switched at birth conspiracy that was planned by her mom and her brothers she was going to “get them and sue them.” She’s a bit more back to normal now that she was being treated for it, but she still has brought it all up a couple of times like she was still questioning things. 

I hate everything. I just want her gone and I still hate that I would rather that over having her be here and being my mom. Mom has been gone for several months. She is truly just a shell now.","I never imagined there would be so much poop cleaning. I pop a mask and gloves on before I get started. It helps a lot. 

We've gotten my dad on a schedule with his eating and pooping so that we get him on the toilet at the same time each night. Most of the time he'll poop there. We also have him on a pretty healthy diet with plenty of fiber so his poops are healthy and less messy. 

Definitely reach out to the local Alzheimer's group and see where they can refer you get get assistance. You need help. Don't neglect your mental health either. I had to start anti anxiety meds after my dad was diagnosed. 

Few things to get ahead of so much cleaning is buy some bed pads. They have some you wash (which we use) and disposable ones (we keep those as backups). We use them on his chair and on the bed. It saves a lot of clean up. And to reduce the pee smell we use vinegar and oxyclean when we wash them.

You are doing awesome taking care of your mom. It's so much more than others do. But you need help. It's so hard to do it alone.
Second the idea about a toileting schedule. If mom pees the bed everyday at 7, then if you get her up and on the toilet (if you can) for 0630, it will reduce the mess you have to deal with. 

I wish you good luck with getting a spot in memory care. It is a horrible disease. Take care of yourself.
Is diarrhea common with Alz? My mother has it and I didn't think it was a side effect of Alz.
My mother put soap in her water.  Please move any soap away from where she can get it.  Obviously your mom may not be doing this, but I promise you I had no idea my mom was doing this until I saw it. If you think cleaning it up makes your stomach hurt, imagine how she feels.
ok, love your user name.  Golden Girls for the win.  Always.  
Second, yeah, incontinence was one of my lines in the sand for taking care of my husband's dad.  It turns out I had a lot of lines and some of them were crossed way before we got to the restroom issues, well, mostly.  He doesn't clean himself properly which results in extra laundry because he sits on his bed sheets and gets them soiled.  We are less than two weeks out from moving him into assisted living.  I was just done.  It's so much.  I wish you luck with your search for a community or facility.  That alone is time consuming and exhausting.  Then you have all the stuff you have to get in order to actually have them admitted.  I'm confident we are making the right decision though.  

I'd counsel anyone else in this position to go ahead and start the visits and start comparing communities for when you make the move to long term care.  You don't want to be under the gun and *need* to make a decision.  It would be best to have a top three ready to go and then choose based on bed availability and a second/third visit with new needs considered.
Getting old ain't pretty. :-(
I'm so sorry you are dealing with this.  My LO is not at that stage yet.
Mask up, helped a lot when I was taking care of my bedbound grandfather.
My mother was diagnosed when she was 44 (I was 24). I am now 45 I will never forget the time that she was taking her own shit and throwing it at me and my father- it was unreal! Hang in there!
You can buy diapers and use gloves and masks, spray some nice odors in mask and change diapers like that, then wash the person every time. Hard.. Yes. But she is not a shell, there will be still lots of times that she will shortly be back to normal.",2021-09-06 23:15:43,shady-pines-ma,pjer6t
Alzheimers,Refusing to take medication,"My grandmother has Alzheimers. Her condition is worsening rapidly, but she refuses to take her medication also to go to her doctor's appointment. Can you give me some advice on how I can persuade her. Also I would like to thank you all . Having some sort of support from people who are going through the same thing has helped me immensely.","We use a pill crusher for my dad and mix it in his pudding. If the pill is small enough we just pop it in the food and he doesn't notice. Some pills aren't meant to be crushed so just look at the medication info to see if it's ok. 

And depending on how far along your grandmother is I wouldn't tell her she going to the doc. Just take her. Go get an ice cream or coffee and then head to the doc. I would also talk to her doctors and see what appointments are absolutely necessary or what can be done via zoom. I'm sure they will be willing to work with ya.
I have hidden it in the miniature candy bars.
Is she not wanting to take it because it’s becoming too hard to swallow? If so, I agree with kippy236 and see if you crush her meds. But make she you can before you do it. 

If swallowing isn’t an issue, just tell her is a vitamin or something else. Or just had it to her without any introduction of what it is. “Hey grandma! Here you go. And here’s some water if you need it.” And see what happens.
we are dealing with this too. my MIL is in memory care and yesterday we just looked under the bed and there were about 15 pills under there. she’s been hiding them in her upper lip when opening her mouth to show the nurse. 

we’re hoping we can crush them
We either mixed it in her dessert. Or we would regularly give her a mint and twice a day switch the mint with her pills.
Use a mortar rather than a pill crusher, you get thin dust that can be disolved in ice cream, a sweet syrup, apple sauce. With age they tend to like or savor more sweet things. We went from fighting with my dad to he thanking when we give him his syrup.
Can you crush it when you're not preparing food and have it in a little parchment or wax paper packet or something to drop in more quickly/subtly during food prep time? Or prep that med-laced food at a different time?  If you do this, id double check with pharmacy how far ahead of time you can do this and whats the best way to do this in case it affects potency. 

Can you make like youre actually preparing food for thats for yourself and then switch it when shes not looking? 

Is there someone who can distract her while you're doing food prep? 

For some drugs theres different forms you can get it in, like liquid or capsule rather than something you can crush. I have a feeling this doesn't apply to the drug you're talking about (i remember pill crushing as a necessity, but it was a long time ago). But still, could ask pharmacist for any suggestions or alternatives. 

Sorry, Alzheimer's is awful the whole way through but it sounds like youre in that tricky stage of trying to be sneaky but not offensive. The only solution might be to find ways to be sneakier. :/
What I have been doing, is crushing my dad meds into really fine powder and mixing it water water, and telling him it’s some fruit juice (it looks brown-ish), so I do mention that it’s apple juice etc.

With regards to heading out to appointments, try and see what your grandma says and blend it into a “lie”. My dad is convinced he owns multiple apartments and buildings, so I usually tell him we are off to his “second house” and he usually comes along. Once he’s at the hospital, he sometimes tells me that he has been here before. 

That was awhile back(think 6 months), dad is now bedridden for the most part and tube fed. So just hoping my experience with dealing with your issues help somewhat. Stay strong and take care of yourself too. 💪🏻
Is she living with a caregiver, or alone?

I live with an affected spouse.  By now, I am doing all the cooking and also manage meds.  Most of his are to be taken with food.  I put them in a bartender's jigger, could also be a small jar or shot glass or salt cellar... and put that out along with his meal.  I always check to be sure he has taken them.

Since he has arthritis, knowing there is a pain pill in his meds (along with statin, BP meds, and Alzheimers meds) is enough inducement for him to medicate.

If he lived alone, I am sure he would be messing up with his medication virtually all the time.  It's just too hard.  So this might be why your grandmother can't take them.

As for doctor appointments, he usually enjoys them (we joke about this being our only social life these days).  But for sure, your gran needs someone to accompany her, as well as mentioning relevant things to the doctor and remembering his instructions.

Good luck.  We all do the best we can.",2021-09-07 06:41:29,Unlikely_Attention,pjkkbu

Alzheimers,Covid-19 and severe Alzheimer’s progression help.,Hi I am new to this subreddit my grandmother has been in the hospital for 4 days now with COVID-19 my family and I had expected some progression with Alzheimer’s but not like she is now. We got news from the doctors today that she has progressed in one week as much as she would have in 3 years she’s now being aggressive not eating using the bathroom or anything that she was doing before. My family is going to put her in an assisted living home because she’s going to need 24/7 assistance. I don’t know what to ask for as far as help or things that we can do to make my grandmas time better. Is there anyone with resources or help groups just anyone to talk about this would be greatly. Thank You in advance.,"I'm not sure how covid progresses Alzheimer's, but it could have been the mix of a Change in location plus the not being able to taste or smell anything. If food has no flavor, mixed with Alzheimer's I can only imagine what they are feeling. I know when my mom got covid she basically stopped eating, and unfortunately that was what killed her. Don't want to scare you obviously, but that is what happened to her.
I'm so sorry. I really am hoping the best for your grandma, mine went through pretty much the same exact thing (minus covid) after a doctor gave her seroquel during an ER visit for a UTI. She went from living on her own with family checking in on her every other day, to the hospital, to assisted living then hospice... within 3-4 weeks. It was awful but she was also the type that couldn't stand the thought of not remembering/having to depend on ANYONE so it was very much her time/her choice. Which brings some sense of peace I suppose. 

Anyway, from a medical standpoint though, they do know that covid seems to attack the brain in younger people (I think the age is mainly due to the significant amount of grey matter your average 20 something has whereas as we age we lose a little each year and there are too many variables to rule out/lack of preliminary scans just before covid to compare to in order adult's.)",2021-09-05 22:42:15,jarfyxX,piqpmz
Alzheimers,Sometimes you just have to see the funny side.,"My dad loves Activia yoghurts. He eats one/multiples day.

My dad does the same - my mom has to hide food, or he will eat everything in sight.  We took him to a graduation party and he was literally taking peoples' cake off of their plates and eating it.  Thankfully, it was family, and we could rein him in.  I guess I'm just glad he's still eating.  Best to you and your family!  You do have to see the funny side.
My wife got out of bed in the middle of the night and said ""It's time for you to get up right now."" My daughter laughed really hard and said she had heard that 1000 times. My wife can hardly speak but that can out clear.
I love the funny sides. My grandpa is lost and has been for years, but never ceased to be a kind human being - this is something I truty cherish. One day my father told him he loved him.

Alzheimers,Suggestions for things to take apart for an Engineer with Alzheimer’s?,"My grandfather has pretty progressed Alzheimer’s, going on his third year. He lives in a memory care unit and we visit him multiple times a week. He’s been an engineer all his life so he keeps trying to take things apart, I.e. pens, his hearing aids, the remote control. The occupational therapist has suggested giving him things we don’t need anymore to take apart or things for him to build. Does anyone have any suggestions for things like this? We can’t give him real tools because we don’t want him to get hurt, but also we think he will start taking everything apart around him. Just something interesting to keep his hands busy. Any suggestions would be appreciated!","How about a Lego set?
We made my dad something similar to this to fidget with, along with a number of locks and keys.  It works for awhile.  Best to you and your family!  https://www.alzstore.com/activity-lock-box-dementia-p/0088.htm
Small appliances. Iron, mixer, toaster, power tools. Buy at goodwill, and remove the power cord. My aunt did this for her overly ambitious kids. If there's someone you can team up with who is a welding artist, maybe they can use the metal parts in some art project.
I was looking at Techno Gears as well as Lego sets with gears.   Your grandfather might not have any interest in a disassembled object, so a family member could put the robotic item together for him to take apart.

I understand about not letting him have any tools.  My sister's father in law had dementia and before he was placed in memory care, he liked to ""fix"" things.  Nothing like finding a screwdriver in a light socket where the bulb used to be.
Based on OP's description of what Grandad usually does - he likes to take apart small plastic items. Legos are put-together items that 'break' if you ask me. Looking for something to snap, slide, twist, and generally fidget sounds like the way to go. The dollar store might have some weird doodads he likes. Doodads for Grandad ;)

It'll be trial and error - both for what Grandad likes, and what caregivers are willing to put up with.  It's a balance of finding what stimulates and what frustrates too.

My LO loves linens. She takes apart her bedsheets and blankets every hour. We have to hide the kitchen and bath towels or they'll end up ""folded"" all over the house. But it gives her something to do.

Best of Luck!

This may seem too juvenile for him, but I gave my brother (late stage 5 Alzheimers)  this [box of nuts & bolts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BTRS4RD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to fiddle with. When I gave it to him, I said, ""These toy bolts and nuts are all mixed up in this box. My neighbor's son wants your help with them.  When you have time, will you match the colors and shapes, and screw them back together?""   He ""played"" with them and lined up matched, screwed-together pairs on his window sill. I'm not sure how long it held his attention, because the length of our visit was limited, but I could tell it interested him enough to keep his hands busy for a while (but admittedly, not as much as taking apart every picture frame in other patients' rooms or disassembling his lamp).  I'm visiting him again later this month if they don't extend the Delta Covid quarantine, so I'm curious to see if he's used them at all (I live 4 hours away so I only visit once or twice a month).
There are various versions of Rubik's cube that might keep him engaged for a while. There is a 2 x 2 cube, Rubik's Twist and Rubik's Snake.
The activity boards with locks and switches, and sorting nuts and bolts, which others have suggested, sound like good ideas.",2021-09-04 00:17:47,lavalamp17,phkopu
Alzheimers,Should you move furniture around on someone with Alzheimer's?,"My FIL has Alzheimer's and MIL is primary care giver on paper but has my wife do everything.   MIL decided she wants us to rearrange the living room.  It is the only room FIL spends time in.  

I think making a big change could confuse him more.  She also wants more chairs which will add trip hazards.

Any suggestions?
Thanks","No.
Yeh, I tend to agree with FieldWelder - no, don't move furniture around on them.  Unless they're really minor changes - and I sure wouldn't add more chairs or unnecessary furniture. I took unnecessary chairs & furniture OUT of my mums living room.  Made it MUCH easier for her, and much safer.

  But Idk, if MIL has some really good reason for wanting to add more chairs?   Or if the rearrangement would in fact make it easier for FIL?    Good luck!
We have given away most of our living room furniture.  It looks sparse, but it's a lot easier to navigiate with a walker.

MIL needs to understand that life is going to be like this, a lot of sacrifices and accommodations, until FIL leaves the home.  

Of course, how you get her to accept that point of view is another conversation entirely.
the only time it should be moved is in order to make the space more open and reduce trip hazards/ make the space work better for the occupant. never add unnecessary furniture to ANY elder’s house! why add trip hazards or make walking paths smaller?? you can change the art on the walls though to add interest
I will throw this out there with our situation. My dad doesn't care. Didn't care when mom and dad moved from their house of 30 years to my home. Didn't care when we moved stuff around. It all depends on how he reacts to stuff. 

I will say the area around his chair only has safe things for him to grab. The area rug is large enough that it covered the whole area and wasn't trippy. We have to help my dad walk now so we always have a hand on him.

Your mom might need a change because she's there all the time. So maybe suggest changing wall art, decor or even a fresh coat of paint. Maybe new furniture covers or pillows.",2021-09-03 21:58:48,Nude-genealogist,phinxm
Alzheimers,Don't live nearby - how do you help?,"This disease sucks. Just heard from my dad that my mom isn't recognizing some of her friends anymore, and can't properly put together the right clothes for an event or outing. And he's really struggling with full-time caregiving. 

Those of you who don't live near your LO, how do you help out? I'm trying to rearrange schedules to spend a week there every 4-6 weeks or so (thank goodness for flexible and remote work), but would really like to do more from where I am.","My siblings have helped out long distance by ordering items our mom needed, like a transport chair.  

Is there something that could make your dad’s life easier?  A cleaning service you could pay and arrange for?  Food delivery so he doesn’t have to prepare as many meals?  

Does you mom like to talk on the phone? Mine can ramble on for hours- and keeping your mother engaged on the phone could give your dad some time to himself.

Full time caregiving is exhausting. You are kind to come down and help every month or so.
I have been here, I was about 800 miles away. It is super hard. Here are some things I did and things I would suggest. 

1) Still call your mom. The conversations might not make sense, but there may be a point where she can't talk on the phone at all. So do it now! This will also give your Dad some respite.

2) Depending on financial ability, check into the memory care homes. NOT to put her there, but sometimes they have a ""day"" program. My Dad told my Mom that she was going to ""club"" and they were going to have activities. He went an participated with her a few times and she didn't really like it, but then got used to it. It gave my Dad a chance to get his hair cut, run errands or just plain take a nap! 

3) Check into home health, even if it's just one or two afternoons a week. These can be put under a preface of ""Nancy is going to come and water plants"" or whatever... Your Dad can leave tasks ""Nancy"" and your mom can do together, like empty the dishwasher, fold towels or household tasks like that. 

4) Freezer meal programs are great to look into, my Dad was not used to doing ALL the cooking. There was a place where he lived you could go and put together meals that would go into the freezer and he could use them 1-2 times a week so he didn't have to do so much cooking. 

5) Find a hair dresser that your Mom knows and is familiar with your Mom. Get an appointment set up every week for a wash and style. Again this is just as much for your Dad as your Mom. It makes her feel special and gives him an hour or so break. 

6) Go shopping for her and get clothes that are easy to put on, elastic pants maybe and button up shirts...then he doesn't have to worry about getting her hair fixed. This can also be an opportunity to find some mix and match clothes...so whatever she puts on will match. Oh...also a silk pillow case for her hair to last longer. 

7) As hard as the conversation is...tell the neighbors if/when your Mom starts wandering about, then they know to help her. 

8) Get used to not telling her no and don't try to correct her. Just go with the flow, if you say no and try to correct her it's just more confusing for her and she might become agitated. 

9) If they have a doctor team...see if you can go with them on your next visit. You might ask some questions that are beneficial to your Dad AND provide you with knowledge as well. 

It's a lot OP. And it's super hard being far away. Just remember every visit you see her, that's the BEST you're going to see her again. So just hug and love the heck out of her, you won't regret it. Many hugs to you.
Giving your dad any amount of time away from caregiving is one of the best things you can do to help, we almost never get time off, real time off where we can leave the situation and not worry. Of course, that comes down to exactly how much care your mother requires and whether you can do everything that your dad does. Thank you for thinking of your dad in this way. It is very kind.
I was closer, but even an hour away was exhausting. Ultimately, we had to move my mom into assisted living. If I bought her clothes or took her shopping, she'd start throwing them away as soon as I left. If it wasn't familiar, it went into the trash. I spent so many hundreds of dollars on clothing that she trashed, and we didn't always catch it in time to stop the trash guys from picking the bags up. She was great at remembering to put out her trash, yet she couldn't reheat a meal without setting it on fire.

She started wandering and that was the end of her being able to be at home alone. Her memory care doctors suggested we put in cameras to check on her each day, and we had a neighbor of hers in our phones if we needed help. Once she started wandering and telling people that this was not her house and to take her home, living alone wasn't an option.

The first assisted living place was a poor fit. The second was amazing. They did a fantastic job with her for the two years we could afford it. She made friends, she enjoyed herself, and it was nice knowing she had expert care from people trained and certified in Alzheimer's care.
I’ve had clients that lived faraway help pay for caregivers to come into their loved ones home. Or pay for a caregiver to come in twice a week to give the other person a break. 

That’s a great way to support your loved ones to make sure they are getting the rest they need! I hope that helps! ❤️
Get some caregivers come in maybe twice a week, from one of those home care agencies.

They can do laundry, pick out a day's clothing for your mom (which teaches your dad how to do the same), catch up on dishes, generally socialize with her, prepare a meal, and just give your  dad a break.  It's good to get this type of in home help accepted earlier, later when it comes to helping bathe her or change a diaper, it won't be such a shock.",2021-09-03 12:32:40,KLK1712,ph8oyc
Alzheimers,Anesthesia and acceleration of Alzheimer's dementia,"It has been demonstrated that anesthesia increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia.  (See e.g.   [Risk of dementia after anaesthsia and surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939441/).)  For patients with existing Alzheimer's disease, if surgery is required, what is the risk of acceleration of mental decline, and are some types of anesthesia worse than others?","That's a good question, and I don't know that there's a definitive or even a speculative answer.  We know that certain events appear to speed progression of dementia - hospitalization, surgery, physical injury and illness, and others - but it's incredibly difficult to isolate what part of those events actually causes the progression. Is it the change in environment with its loss of familiar context? The social isolation, especially with Covid? Inflammation and the cytokines which promote sickness behavior? The specific anesthetic used in surgery? The mode of anesthetic? The type of surgery (the paper you linked to pointed out that five of the eight surgery types were linked with an increase risk of dementia diagnosis within five years, but that three of them were not)?

You've asked a very high level question, and it's not one I could find a quick answer to with a handful of searches on [pubmed.gov](https://pubmed.gov). The members of this subreddit tend to be friends, family members, caregivers, and in a few instances the person with dementia.

Alzheimers,Friends mother sick with Alzheimers,"Hey, my(f20) friend’s (f21) mother (f57)is very sick with Alzheimers. She is pretty alone going through all this😔What can I do to support? What is the wrong and right things to say and comfort with?","Your poor friend - she is so young to be going through this. Thank you for wanting to help her.

The first thing I would suggest is that you find a local Alzheimers/ dementia group in your area, and when you speak with her, let her know that she may like to consider contacting them for advice and suggestions.

Encourage your friend to do as much research as she can into her mum's condition. It will be confronting, but the more idea she has of what to expect, the better.

If she's not already, your friend could attend her mother's medical appointments to find out what stage her mum is at.  Her mum's GP or specialist may also be a source of information for your friend regarding local support groups.

It sounds like your friend has very few, if any, relatives around who can support or help her - but if she does have family, encourage her to get in contact with them.

Your friend will be confused, frustrated, angry, sad - a whole range of emotions, that may change on a daily (or even hourly) basis.  Try to be patient with her, as she may lash out at you in frustration.

Your friend will be experiencing a kind of grief - she is losing her mum, but her mum is still physically here, but it's not the mum she knows/knew.  I can tell you from personal experience - this is one of the hardest things to come to terms with (and I'm a lot older than your friend - I can't imagine how I would have coped at your friend's age).  Please let her know that ALL her feelings are valid - even the ones she doesn't want to admit to having.  I find myself sometimes thinking ""it would be so much easier if she (and my dad) were dead"".  That's a totally normal and understandable thought to have from time to time, even though it goes against everything we might normally think.  She will feel guilty for even thinking it - but I think I can safely say that no-one in her position hasn't thought that at some stage.

I don't know if your friend is her mum's carer, but if she is, some really practical things are: sitting with her mum  while your friend goes out for a few hours; take around some meals that can be frozen, so your friend isn't cooking all the time; offer to do some grocery shopping or cleaning for her. I'm not suggesting that you do all of these every day or week - you need to look after yourself, too - but offering them occasionally would, I'm sure, be gratefully received.

Get your friend to ask her mum about her childhood, any family, places she lived etc. Her mum's long-term memory is probably much better than her short-term - and eventually your friend will be grateful to know this information.

Encourage your friend to laugh - whether it be at the funny things her mum is doing, or something completely unrelated - laughing helps. Let her cry on your shoulder if she needs to (trust me - she needs to).  If there is someone else who can share the caring duties, take your friend out one night and go dancing, to the movies, anything that gives her a break and time to 'forget' for a while.

Everyone's Alzheimers journey is different, and apart from physical/ emotional parental abuse, there is no right and wrong way to deal with it. 

For what it's worth, I'm sending lots of love to your friend and to you xxx
Hey, my dad got Alzheimer’s when I was 21, since then I have been his primary caretaker. Thank you so, so much for noticing that your friend could use support, and she’s very lucky to have you in your corner. That makes a world of difference.

You can always reach out to local and national Alzheimer’s organizations, they have a lot of resources to help you. If you’re in the US: https://www.alz.org/local_resources/find_your_local_chapter. If you’re in Denmark: https://www.alzheimer.dk

Here’s my two cents.

Things to do - Your friend, I’m guessing, is probably going to be overwhelmed with a lot of plates spinning at the same time. She will also probably have made the experience that a lot of people around her are virtue signaling, giving a polite talk about how they would love to support her and then not showing up when she actually needs help. Just the fact that you want to help and you MEAN it is already a huge source of support to your friend.

It will go a long way if you take the initiative to propose a specific action at a specific time, instead of waiting for her to reach out to you. Example: “I had an idea, let me know if this would be helpful. How about I bring by some groceries every Wednesday / watch your mom every other Saturday evening so you can go out / drive y’all to and from the next doctor’s appointment / do the laundry and take out the trash every other Monday,” etc depending on what she needs at the moment and what you can definitely do. 

Unlike many friendships in one’s 20s, with her it will be extra important to make sure to keep the commitments you do make (and not say you’ll help with something if there’s a chance you can’t make it). It’s better to start small and possibly work your way up to big things than to exhaust yourself — caregiver burnout is real!

Since your friend will be giving over a lot of her attention and energy to her mother, there will not be a lot left for herself, or for you and her friendships in general. Encourage her to look after herself, and gift her things she can use for self-care, such as books if she loves to read, tea if she drinks it, massage coupons if she’s into that and it’s in your budget etc. If she lashes out at you or isolates herself from you and other friends, try to be forgiving and take the initiative to reach out. Make sure you’re also taking care of yourself, and find someone you can confidentially vent to if things in your friendship ever get frustrating. 

If you haven’t already, you and your friend may want to consider individual therapy, if you have access to it.

Things to say - This depends a lot on the kind of person she is. If you have that kind of relationship, it couldn’t hurt to ask - “What are some helpful things I can say?” and “What are some things people say to you that are unhelpful?” 

Sometimes she may not want to talk about it and may resent being asked how she feels. You can try saying things like, “Do you want to just sit on your bed and listen to music?” “If you like we can just sit in silence on the porch.” “Would you rather be alone?” If she says yes to the last one, try not to be hurt, and try to arrange a later opportunity to check in with her before you go, like, “I’ll try calling on Friday,” or “Can I pick you up / walk home with you from work/school on Tuesday?”

Sometimes she may just want to vent, in which case she may not want to hear solutions or distractions, but instead have a friend who listens and says things like, “That sounds so hard,” “Nobody should have to go through that,” “How are you feeling about that?”

Sometimes she may want to be soothed. “You can do this, you’ve come this far,” “You’re going to be okay. It’ll take some time but you’re going to be okay,” “It feels so hard now, but one day we will look back at this and be so proud of how you’ve managed this.”

Your friend will hear people who are lucky enough to have great relationships with healthy parents cheerfully describe at length family vacations and mom’s cooking on holidays and how fun dad’s birthday was etc. It always reminded me of what I was losing forever. Events that many of your friend’s peers celebrate (Mother’s Day, birthdays, holidays), as well as the anniversary of the diagnosis, may be especially hard and depressing times for your friend. If you are lucky and your parents are healthy, try not to talk a lot about them when talking to your friend.

A lot of people will say “I know how you feel” when it’s not true. I’ve lost count of how many people told me, “I know exactly what you’re going through, my grandma died of Alzheimer’s when I was 9.” Well no, it’s my parent and not grandparent who is sick, plus I am his primary caretaker, so those situations are not at all the same. Sometimes it can be really comforting to hear, “I don’t know what to say,” “I can’t imagine how you must be feeling,” “I wish I knew what to do, but I don’t.”

Some people will tell your friend things like, “It’s been five years since her diagnosis, why are you still upset about it? Don’t you think it’s time to move on?” So you can help by saying things like, “I know Mother’s Day is coming up and that can be hard. What if we get (someone trustworthy) to watch your mom and you and I can go bike to the park together or hang out at my place and watch our favorite TV show and eat ice cream,” or whatever it is that you two enjoy doing together. 

Sending you all my best wishes for getting through this. ❤️
Offer time. Shopping, and other tasks will help.
The fact that you've even posted this says you're a good friend. I would just ask her how she's doing and her mother. She may want to talk and she may not, but asking is key. 

When things get crazy for her, offer to do things for her or sit with her and her Mom. It's super hard, but having people outside of family is really great for support. 

You're a GOOD friend OP.
My nana has had Alzheimer's for almost 7 years now and helping with care duties and distracting them when they need it are amazing. The best thing that my friends do for me besides those is to listen to stories and look at pictures when I want to reminisce and talk about my loved one. It helps me a lot to be able to just share my favorite memories and show the thousand old pictures and videos I have. It really means a lot that they are there for me to just babble on about whatever I want to.

Alzheimers,How to get a diagnosis?,"I have a family member who shows signs of dementia or Alzheimer's. Unfortunately this person aggressively refuses to get diagnosed - we've managed to get them to a doctor once and as soon as they realized why they were there they simply walked out of the clinic. 

Are there any strategies or ideas on how to deal with this? Most of the things I see online are centered around either getting them to a doctor or handling the aftermath of a diagnosis. Neither of these are the problem - they just walk out if the conversation turns to memory issues.","You could ask them a series of questions just like the doctor does.  I’m sure you can google that.  But if I recall correctly it’s something like:  who is the President, what is your birthday, could backwards by 3 (or some number), show a picture of a clock and ask what time it is.  Write the date in the paper and try again in a month or two, and again later.  This really is all the doctor will do, at least that’s all I’ve seen.  It’s a baseline of where your loved one is right now.  Try again with the doctor when you can.  Do not say it’s for memory.  You could even say YOU are sick and have them go with you.  The entire disease for you will be learning coping and cajoling skills, and watching your loved one decline.  It’s terrible even with the kindest, sweetest patients.  Good luck.
Maybe you could tell the doc ahead of time what the prob is, and then you and doc can describe any evaluations as ""routine"" related more to their age or some other medical problem, rather than memory. Doc could say ""oh i do this to all my patients over 60 bc they tend to have dietary deficiencies."" Something like that.
My mother was like that. Nothing worked until she was in a later stage. That was two years ago we finally was able to get her to a neurologist for diagnosis and after that she progressed fairly fast in two years. Now mom is in a memory care unit for 7 weeks now and not happy being there to the point where she was being a PITA to the staff. Everyday I was getting calls. Then no more calls. Found out two weeks ago the reason why. Over medicated. I took photos and videos. Now the home and one aunt says she has to be like this for her own safety and a condition of her staying in the home. 

Needless to say I’m not pleased.

Good luck OP! ❤️",2021-09-01 16:57:39,goddess_eris,pg2xql
Alzheimers,This is hard,"I've suspected for a while but today we got the confirmation that my mom is solidly in stage 5. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's last spring in 2020 (previously it was thought to be some form of dementia but unspecific at that point).

In any case, she's been really good at hiding how bad things have gotten. I see her twice a week. She didn't recognize my sister last weekend (specifically the 22nd). It was awesome that I had to be the one to tell her (/s). I thought it might have been some form of hallucination. I thought she just didn't recognize her because of this. It turns out, I was correct. She called my sister today and said there was a weird man named (dad's name) in our house and she couldn't find our father, (dad's name). In retrospect, I'm incredibly glad I warned my sister about not recognizing her because she was so thankful this call didn't take her completely off guard. Unprompted, my Dad told us that she wanted to pay him for watching the house and wanted to know where the man who lived there was. My dad says he could only describe it as a hallucination. I suppose I should have warned him this was coming, I thought I had more time. I have a psych degree (undergrad only) and specialized in memory disorders because my paternal grandmother had passed from complications with Alzheimer's.

I'm a bit rambly. Tonight has been hard and I hit the wine a little too much.

I'm not ready for this. I want my Mom back. I'm only 32. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old and I wanted them to know their grandparents like I never knew mine. How is this fair? I miss her so much.","It’s rough, sorry to hear it- I find it hard keeping everyone informed of my moms changes, especially the people who just check in once in a while. 

All you can do is your best, there really is nothing else expected. Take care of yourself.
I feel your pain, I'm 35 and going through this with my mom. It feels too soon for me to be losing the essence of who my mom is and its so unfair that shes losing herself in her mid 50's. 

If your only 32, I guess your mom has to be pretty young too huh? 

&#x200B;

I can relate to your agony about your kids being so young.  My wife and I don't have kids yet so the fact that my mom might not ever really know my kids breaks my heart.

I was in a fog for several months when my mom was first diagnosed but I can tell you that you do eventually find the strength to deal with it and keep doing the next right thing.
I was about 30 when my mum was diagnosed, so I know something of your pain. There are tons of threads in this subreddit that can give you in depth advice on specific parts of dealing with it. The one thing I will say is no matter how bad your mother gets, always remember that she is still in there trying to make sense of the world through faulty machinery, the way you communicate with her might need to change, it is trial and error really. You may see glimpses of the old her now and then, and those moments are to be cherished. Look after yourself too.
I'm so sorry.  Yes, it is hard.  All we can do is share love and availability.
I'm 22 and my dad is 65 and was diagnosed with this 4 years ago. It's though seeing your love one going through this. I'm at the stage where (my dad, never an aggressive figure) is now in the hospital and in the process of looking for a skilled nurse facility because he's too agitated and aggressive to be left at home with family members. There have been multiple instances where he couldn't recognize me as his son and started physical contact with me. It's so difficult seeing your love one slowly kinda lose touch with reality. Constantly being confused by what real and what isn't.
Your mom is still in there. Treasure the lucid moments that you have w/ her & enjoy the time you have left w/ her! It’s a lot of work, but it’s so worth it! She paid it forward when you were a child. Time to pay it back!
This really hits home with me. I recently discovered that my mom has it and I was kinda forced into a situation where I ended up confronting her about it. She has been taking it very hard. It is her worst nightmare come true. She has threatened suicide and today when I came over, she was in her bed so drunk that she could not even construct sentences. She was slowly trying to piece together words. I almost completely lost my shit.

We haven’t gotten an official diagnosis yet but my dad is a retired doctor and he said this had been progressing for a few years now (he didn’t want to burden me with the knowledge). I have a girlfriend but no children yet and I am absolutely terrified that I will lose her soon and she will never meet my children.
I wish you patience. My sincere feelings are with you. I lost my grandmom on July 25, who raised me when my mom was working. I am 29 years old. 

I know there is very little to do, and things will not get better. 

There will be days where you will have to decide she should stay in a hospital intensive care, or with you. We choose “with us” option, it wasn’t going to change anything anyways. But we wanted to be around her in her last moments instead of some machines in a cold room.

I don’t know your mom’s situation. But there are still small things that can make her remember all of you again, that I wish we could practice more with my grandmom. I am pretty sure you know all the meds and supporting pills etc, so I will pass those. But one thing clearly makes difference and we totally easily skip that, walking, small exercises with your help, arms, legs, and sitting under sun with fresh air. 

I took my grandmom to hospital 20 days before her death, after 5 days of arrival from the hospital, she started “not to leave the bed” and within 14 days we lost her. 

When I took her to hospital, her memory was entirely gone, she was not aware of anything, not able to create long sentences, or sentences that makes sense. Only “I am afraid” or “I am thristy” kind of things. But I was speaking to her doctors on the garden of the hospital and I forgot her wheelchair was under the direct sun for like 20 minutes maybe, she said it was hot, and I said sorry, but it’s good for the bones! Then we tried to walk with the help of 3 other people for like 5 minutes until she is visibly exhausted. We came back home, the first thing she said was “(my mothers name), give Orderabi a glass of water, kid is tired!” and we were like crazy happy after almost 6 months she remembered us. 

Also, if you can create an album collecting your pictures with her from different years, names on top of those pictures, like me & my son James  kinda design will help a lot and bringing her old belongings around the house will also make her much more relaxed about everything. Making her wear her old dresses, my grandmom singed her favorite childhood song a month before her death by heart with the singer and cried to it!

These are all small things but believe me, all valuable, every meaningful words she will say will become so much valuable for you, you can also ask questions like do you like to share with me some story with your mom, her name etc and record them with a camera, you can show her this record and say this is you, and keep as a memory for yourself. 

I wish you patience, again. I am here anytime if you need somebody to talk. Take care.",2021-08-31 01:09:33,MorpheusD,pezajp
Alzheimers,"Well, this is just jolly.","Yesterday I asked DH where his walker was.  He said with assurance, ""It's downstairs.""  

Me:  ""We don't have a downstairs.  There is no basement, we just have a concrete slab and the apartment is all one level.""

DH:  ""We DO have a downstairs.""

Me:  ""Where is it?""""

We went back and forth a few more times and all the way to bedtime, and beyond, he went in search of the door to ""downstairs.""  He swore up and down we have a basement ""because I've been in it!""  He was a bit haggard by the end, having tried the door to the pantry, the garage, the laundry room, the utilities closet IN the laundry room, my walk-in closet, both bathrooms, and even looking carefully at the windows.  He insisted, ""there IS a downstairs and I know how to find it, there's a way to get into it without even going outside.""

I suggested it might be better to look for it in the morning and I finally got him into bed.  We laugh a lot at his Alzheimer's (as well as everything else) but I'm kind of afraid to remind him of this incident, not that he would get mad at me but he might spend the next day and a half searching for a basement that doesn't exist.

Just thought this might give someone a smile.  Have a great day, caregivers!","We try to find the humor in it as well.  But, one thing I've learned, I never tell Mom she's wrong or remind her of her mistakes.  Makes her feel bad and then we're guaranteed to not have a good day.
Good for you. Keep finding the funny stuff.
my mom is perpetually packing up her things in preparation for going 9ver to her other house.  There is no other house.  We remind her of this but 5 minutes later she's back to packing.",2021-08-30 10:30:27,UnsightlyFuzz,pej8lh
Alzheimers,How can I best help someone who doesn't remember what they don't remember?,"Sorry, confusing title, I know.

My mum has diagnosed alzheimers. My dad has had an assessment, but we haven't heard the outcome yet - but there's some kind of cognitive decline going on.  

My parents are still living independently, and they are getting on each other's nerves something shocking.  One (or possibly both) keep moving things around the house, and the other can't find said item.  This could be pills, wallets, books etc etc.  These items are often found in the most obscure places.

Anyway, my issue today is: both parents are insisting the other is verbally abusing them; deliberately hiding things; threatening the other with 'being taken away' etc.  I don't know who is actually telling the truth (or the truth as they believe it) and I just don't know what to say to either of them.  They can both sound coherent and make sense (sometimes!), and neither of them seems to remember that the other one is unwell and that they need to be more patient with the other.  Mum (for instance) says she knows she 'forgets a few things' but seems to have no understanding of just how much she forgets, and if we try to explain it to her, she gets upset and defensive.  

Dad is just off in his own little world, ignores mum most of the time and never wears his hearing aids (presumably so he doesn't have to listen to mum repeat the same story/question over and over again).  He will make a statement, apropos of absolutely nothing, and 5 mins later deny saying it.  When we try to explain this is what's happening, he refuses to believe it.

In short, they are both forgetting that they are forgetting stuff and blaming each other for anything and everything!

Does anyone have any tips or hints about how to deal with this?  We're at our wit's end trying to negotiate this stage of their lives, and it's incredibly stressful that after almost 60 years together, they don't even seem to like each other any more.

Any help or suggestions would be gratefully received.  FWIW, I'm in Australia.","Smile and nod, and agree that it must be very stressful to have that going on.... to both of them.  

It doesn't really matter who is doing it.  What are you going to do?  Tell them to stop?  That will be forgotten in moments.  So you smile and nod and commiserate.  The important part is that they are being heard.

Stop explaining.  You're frustrating them and you.  They simply are not able to ""get it"" or believe it.  It's not that they WON'T.  They CAN'T.  (There's a clinical term for this, but I can't remember it for the life of me atm)  

So what do you do?  You smile and nod and commiserate.  You keep things as calm as you can.  You listen to what they are saying even if they won't remember it 5 minutes from now.  Because they won't remember what they said, but they will remember the feeling.
Try to distract them- there’s no real fix for this. It’s tempting to try to hold them responsible for what they do and say, since we’re all so used to dealing with people who don’t have Alzheimer’s- but imagine this...

So, you record your dad saying something. 20 minutes later, he’s denying it, has no recollection- now you show him the video. 

Put yourself in his shoes- in your head, you know for a fact you never said that. But here’s the proof, undeniable- you’re now forced to try to process the hard truth that you may be losing your mind. Imagine how scary that is- 

And he’ll do the same thing again anyway, because this is what the disease does to his brain. It’s not his fault at all. Trying to explain to someone who’s losing their memory that they’re losing their memory is a losing battle, and you gain nothing from it. Awareness of it won’t stop it.

Redirect instead- change the subject, get them to focus on something else- all we can really do is try to make things less stressful for them, AND for us. I find myself losing patience with my mum sometimes, like, I just answered the same question 15 times in a row, can’t you write it down or something- but you have to laugh, it really is ridiculous expecting an Alzheimer’s patient to just not have Alzheimer’s.
You are confusing them with facts.  They are both in denial and there is nothing you can do to change that.  My Mom is the same way.  We tried to explain she has Alzheimer's.  Even in early stage 6 she was claiming there was nothing wrong with her brain.  

You are fighting a battle you can't win.  I'm sorry but you can't explain anything to them.  You will not be able to get them to understand what's happening.  Humor them as much as you can.  Get advice from the professionals. 

Good luck
I can't believe you're dealing with two dementia patients at the same time. I'm helping to look after my father who is displaying many of the same issues you mentioned, right down to the hearing aids. 
Anyway, I'm starting to realize that I've reached the depths of my care taking abilities and he now needs trained professionals. My family and I have done everything we can to manipulate his environment so that he's comfortable but he's progressed to a stage where we can no longer fix his problems. It's taking a toll on all of us. As much as long term care scares me, I know it's the right option. My advice would be to look into it, or at least in-home care. Not sure what Auz offers for assistance, but I hope there's some sort of help you can get. The situation clearly calls for it.
That's a tough situation, I feel with you. 

I think the tips in the thread about redirection and distraction are right, talking facts or sense just doesn't work. Both my parents also have dementia and I can identify with you quite a lot. 
The best advice I've gotten so far is to create a pleasant and comfortable environment/ setup. Talk about your experiences and what you've done instead of asking questions. Bring some flowers that you picked or some bread you baked/bought. Anything that is nice really.

And if you're not up for it, give yourself a break, try to be nice to yourself. If you can, get a break from helping them, you need to live too :-)",2021-08-30 04:19:56,Megan2153,pedu1q
Alzheimers,Advice needed,"Hi friends. I hope to gain some help in ways to deal with my situation so any advice is much appreciated as I don’t have anyone to speak to about this. 

This year my grandma has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s which was a big and sudden blow to our family. She is the closest person to me in our family so you can imagine it was devastating to hear. 

My mother took her in to live with her to watch over her and make sure she’s okay. She watches over her, cooks for her, makes sure she takes her medicines and she is trying very very hard.

My mother is one of the kindest and selfless people I know, she does everything for us. However, she is a very explosive person who often screams and loses patience easily without even realizing how she is speaking. This was a hard adjustment (and still is) for her to accept that her mom is not the same full thinking adult that she used to be and to be aware of the diagnosis. She often gets into arguments with grandma over small things, even though these fights are absolutely pointless as grandma just gets the stress but will forget everything the next day. Not to mention they could be easily avoided. After these fights she feels bad but the damage is done already. I fear that grandmas condition worsens as a result of these stressful situations. Whenever I try to say anything to mom about this or how she speaks to grandma during these periods she gets defensive and screams at me, which also results in nothing being resolved and her not hearing me. 

I understand my mom and her frustration. All of her children live abroad, her partner is also living in another country and due to Covid they cannot even see each other, so she is alone in this and on top of that Alzheimer’s is very frustrating to deal with, especially considering fact that it’s happening to her mom and she obviously feels scared and sad about that. She is doing her best and I know that she is just tired, and grandmas comments such as “I am a burden to you all” just blow her fuse off at the end of the day when all she does is for her family and she barely ever does anything for herself.

I feel sad and hopeless and I worry for both of their states. I don’t know how to approach this.

I wonder does anyone else have a similar situation and how do I deal with it?","Oh, so sorry to hear that OP, it's difficult.  My sister sometimes screams at my mum & myself, even at her best is generally very rude & offensive - it's awful.   Sure, your mother must be having lot of stress, but shouting at you both is terrible, very sad.  

 Looking through the websites for alzheimers .org and dementia .org for your country maybe or any of the English-speaking countries, they have plenty resources, tips, advice, information, etc regarding how to live with the memory-lossed, for themselves & their family / friends / carers.   They also have telephone helplines, if you can even call for support & advice. 

You could also look at mental-health sites, for how to try defuse & de-escalate someone having a stressed-out flip-out.     So sorry Lucky-staff, it's tough.  Best of luck!
As someone who was known to verbally explode from time to time, it came down to depression and really lousy self-esteem. I'd married young, had two kids and did everything for them and my husband, but I lost myself in the process.

 I went into therapy and realized that I never told people no and hadn't put myself first in decades. I wasn't equipped to be the neighborhood ""hey, can you watch my kid while I run to the store..."" and often had the kids of three households at once, on top of my own, and people assuming that stay-at-home mom's did nothing. 

When my second kid was old enough, I tried to go back into the working world after 20 years of working as a freelancer. I had multiple places tell me that I had no marketable job skills after being home with kids for so long, despite having been a virtual assistant for about 15 of those years. It destroyed my self-confidence, but I finally landed a job and was thriving, only to have to quit because my dad passed away unexpectedly. My mom couldn't be left alone and my dad had been her caregiver.

A year into that, I realized I couldn't do it anymore. Your mom may have no idea how to put herself first. If she can do that, it will change her world. My mom was moved into assisted living, and there's guilty, but she also has had far better care than I could have handled.
For me as a caregiver, I adopted a new attitude: Don't sweat the small stuff, it's all small stuff. You might be able to help your mom adopt that attitude. 

Arguing with a person who ability to absorb information and process that information is flawed is pointless. I have found that using the power of suggestion seems to work better than arguing. 

Can you arrange to give your mom a break? Either by going home and taking over grandma's care for a day / few hours or by hiring a caregiver to do it? Your mom might resist but giving her a chance to take time for herself would be good.
All of us who are caregivers recognize what your mother is going through.  The most important thing I can recommend is for her to find a caregiver support group.  If your grandmother can't be left alone, it will have to be a virtual one or even just a support forum.  

She should contact the Alzheimer's resources in her area.  You can help with this, do a google search for Alzheimer's and (city or state).

Another useful contact is the agency on aging for her locale.  They can help her figure out what financial help your mother can access.  Again, google ""aging"" and (city or state).

At some point (and maybe not too distant) your grandmother might be better served in Assisted Living.  This is where financial assistance becomes most relevant.

I try to be a loving caregiver to my husband, but sometimes I do lose it and yell.  He had a hand surgery recently and kept undoing the dressing.  I yelled when I saw what he had done.  After the third time I insisted they put a rigid cast on him so he *couldn't* undo the dressing.

Best wishes to you and your family.",2021-08-29 20:02:06,Lucky-Staff2082,pe6v4z
Alzheimers,Question about last stages of dementia,"Hello everyone,

I'm a young person who has a grandmother than we believe is hit with dementia but her case is rather unique. She had a heart attack a few years ago and we discovered with recent medical checks that most of her brain cells have died ever since however she didn't lose most of her abilities right away, it was progressive and it was something we didn't notice at first.

The most signs we had noticed was when my grandfather passed away in 2018, that's when she came to live with us and we believe that his death was rather dramatic since her state has worsened ever since. At first the issues weren't that big, she could still hold conversations and remember things, she could observe people and give judgement about them, etc. She would sometimes become anxious when being alone and would have troubles sleeping at times but that's it.

2019 things became more difficult, her sleepings difficulties have increased, her memories have declined, we were expecting it so it didn't shock us much at the time, she could still stay by herself when my parents went to work and I would help her when I came from school by preparing us lunch.

2020 that's when the troubles became, she had become too unstable, she couldn't sleep at night and whenever we left her alone in a room because we had things to do or needed to discuss in private she'd wander around until finding us and staying by our side, she couldn't stay alone in a literal way and even if she would be with people she would start wandering from times to times. She could still use her bathroom alone and wash her hands.

2021 my father doesn't live with us anymore and has moved elsewhere because she was too unstable for the family and we couldn't sleep nor focus on our school activites or work, he's currently taking care of her and I visit her during vacations. I saw her this summer, she has become a lot worse, she barely can say more than a few words and 95% of what she says is nosense or unrelated to any events, she can barely count to 5 (she counts our fingers), she can't tell what time it is anymore nor does she remember how old is she. (She still remembers her name)

She forgot my mother's name (despite having lived with her for more than 20 years), she confuses my father's name with mine and calls most people by the same name, sometimes she pronounces random names of people we aren't really familiar with (perhaps from her youth ?)

Another major issue is that she wanders a lot and has become quite agressive whenever we try to call her inside or want to make her sit for a bit (because she hurts herself while wandering), even if it's dark outside she will open the door and leave (my father has to lock the door and remove the key from there and even then she tries to snatch the door away, gives up, wanders around then repeats) 

My father has been on low sleeping cycles for almost a year now, my grandmother sleeps only a few hours and then never ends wandering, she sometimes sits at the balcony but conversation with her is rather impossible and we even have to force her eat sometimes because she stops after every spoon she takes.

Can someone tell me what stage is this ? From what I read it does sound like stage 6 of dementia but I'm not quite sure. Since she had a heart attack her progression has been rather fast compared to how dementia evolves (according to the articles I've read) and it might be due to her cerebral damage. 

For how long can we expect for her to be by our side at this point ?","My mother died within a year of getting to the stage your grandma is in. We had to put an alarm on the door.
My dad lasted over a decade when he was like this. Talking gibberish, but able to wander, could still eat but didn't want to. Everybody different. 

Because shes progressing rapidly tho, and is sometimes not eating, you might consider if shes ready for in-home hospice. It could make things easier for your father. Of course ask her doc (youd need to anyway).
The progression sounds pretty normal and likely has nothing to do with the heart attack. You only started noticing then because you we’re paying more attention due to the heart attack. If possible memory care would be a good place for her. It’s more than one person can handle on their own. My mother in law was recently moved from assisted living to memory care, she has 7 kids and it was more than all of them combined could handle. She’s at about the same stage as your grandmother. Stage 6, mid to late.
This is a typical pattern of progression in vascular dementia, which is different from Alzheimer’s. A heart attack signals vascular problems already. Usually a decline is swifter with vascular but with some periods of plateau. If she has other cardiac related conditions like high blood pressure, it can be worse if they are not managed well. It’s hard to get someone at this stage to take a medication for anything. It sounds like things are changing rapidly now. I’m sorry this is happening.
My grandma is at the same stage as yours, now I know its nothing too unusual for an alzheimer patient.
Widowed MIL would forget to take a bite, if  she wasnt reminded, unless it was ice cream she was eating. Ice cream seems to be a favorite of Alzheimer’s patients.

She never wandered & never got aggressive. 5 of her 6 kids refused to take her in. She walked a daily mile w/ a smile w/me & our dog, but her other kids were bound and determined to put her in memory care. 

No one else wanted to share time w/ her & take turns taking her in, even after being offered the $5000/month it instead cost to house MIL in memory care. 

MIL lasted 7 weeks until NP prescribed destabilizing benzos caused her to fall repeatedly in her room. She broke her femur & no one called 911. She was quickly put on hospice & left to rot in bed. First w/no morphine for a week & then they killed her w/ it. After 10 weeks total in memory care, she was gone. Hell of a way to go.",2021-08-27 12:18:33,Underkodt,pcqk8n
Alzheimers,Dentist - dementia + scared,"My mother is petrified when she goes to the dentist.  It seems like she now had issues with her teeth (cavities, crowns, etc) nearly every month.   

She is so scared when I say we are going to dentist and we have tried some pills like xanax to relax her.

Any tips or is this common for those with dementia ?","Not really but quick story.

My dad was always embarrassed about his teeth.
Recently we lost a week of sleep and could not figure out why the sudden restlessness at night.

We checked his teeth and sure enough a great big cavity that looked infected.

The dentist was great and patient with our needs and even tolerated the extra effort to get the xray.

I held his hands through the procedure while they numbed his mouth and extracted two teeth. It was a pleasant experience and I hope your mother’s dentist is as caring as the dentist we visited.
I found a dentist where the hygienist's grandmother has Alzheimer's. She is fantastic with my mom, and that eases my mom's fear during a visit.",2021-08-26 21:15:07,sportsguyred,pcd035

Alzheimers,Stage 7 What to expect,"Mom is stage 6E on the FAST scale.  She is approaching Stage 7.

The doctors won't give me any ballpark ideas for life expectancy.  I am trying to make sure she doesn't outlive her money.  Internet research says 1-3 years at that stage.  She sleeps most of the time.

Anybody have any experience you can share?","It's so hard to tell. When my mom was diagnosed in 2013 after showing early symptoms as far back as 2009/2010, we were told given her overall health, she may make it 20 years. Her doctor handed us each a copy of Coach Broyle's Playbook and told us that was a good guideline to follow. She was in the 4th stage for several years. Then she skyrocketed and was quickly at 6 only to plateau there.  We're into year 11 and heading towards year 12, and her money is out. We did everything we could, but her rage has been unreal. She tried to attack a fellow resident, then another, breaking her arm in one rage, and then moved on to attacking nurses. All of those ER trips to try to get her mood stabilized drained what was left of her money. For the past year, she's talked less and less. She is now in a wheelchair and sleeps all day. I really expected it to go faster now, but it's still just kind of slow and steady.
I can't answer your question but  am curious what scale you are using to measure? Can you link to it?
Something like this:
[Fast scale](https://pathwayshealth.org/dementia-care/a-look-at-the-hospice-dementia-fast-scale/)
We are currently full fledge stage 6 and no idea what will come next or how long
We're going through the exact same issue. Trying to make their money last as best we can, but no idea how long he has left.",2021-08-24 21:09:29,ImNotBothered80,pb0qmu
Alzheimers,Do any of you use any kind of gps tracker?,"My dad is still in the early stages. But getting worse fast. Easily confused whenever he's in an unfamiliar place. Which pretty much means whenever he leaves the house now. But also won't admit how bad he is, so he keeps insisting on going out. Sometimes takes the car keys and goes before any of us realize he's gone. 

Said he just went to the corner store for coffee. He was gone almost 3hrs. Can't even account for where he was, doesn't realize he was gone for so long. 

He won't wear a bracelet or necklace. Keeps loosing his phone or forgets to charge it, so a simple phone tracker app won't help. What else is there? Shame we can get him chipped like a pet lol.","It's time to make sure he is never alone. When talking to professionals I was told several times that gps trackers create a false sense of security. If it's on the keys he may walk off with the keys. It it's on the car he can walk away from the car. In the shoes, he may take them off. 

We stopped letting my dad drive. And we put bells on the door so we would hear if they were opened. We also put one of those slide locks at the base of a few doors because he would not think to look down there to unlock it. Then later we used those door handle caps to prevent toddlers from twisting the handles. It's was a tough time but eventually he stopped trying to walk away. 

We stopped my dad from driving early on because he tried turning on the headlights with his foot like back in day. He could easily forget to break, or hit the gas instead of break and hurt himself or someone else.

Edit: typo
We put a samsung tracker in his favourite jacket, but that doesn't always work with the hot weather. Bought some apple airtags and attached one to his keys (which he compulsively grabs before going on a walk). Did mean Mom had to switch her phone. We also put a Ring security system in, which has 'door open' notifications that can be sent to the phone, so Mom knows if he's gone out the door, rather than having to do a room-to-room visual check of the house to find him.  


The other part? You \*need\* to confiscate or control the car keys. Walking is one thing, but in a car, he's a danger to others.
Tldr: I downloaded Life 360 on my grandmother's phone shortly after I left for college, and it helped us find her in a snowstorm a few months later. I think it's worth it, that, or I used to use a Tile and slip a thin one in her purse. 


So, I had previously lived with my grandmother from 2009 to 2015, and was heavily involved in her life, especially after mu grandfather suddenly passed. She was, and still is, my everything. But, back then she was still incredibly sharp and stubborn and could not sit still for the life of her. She worked and volunteered and did anything to keep her from being home alone, while I was at school. She was adamant that there was nothing currently going on with her, and that she would notice and let us (my folks) know. 

Late 2015, I went off and started college an hour away, and kept up with weekly phone dates and visits on the weekends. But, by then I started noticing her slip, she wasn't fully there, and would sometimes struggle to carry on a conversation or remember where little things were. She was still incredibly active in her community, and was not willing to stay at home all day long doing nothing. So, around Thanksgiving of 2015, I downloaded Life 360 on her phone as a way to keep track of her. My mom had access to her location too, that way we could both check in on her. We entered addresses that were frequent locations for her, that way we could know where she was at certain times, which ended up being super helpful. 

A year later, in December, we were hit with a bad snowstorm. It was almost Christmas, and I was back in town visiting folks, and my grandmother was supposed to be staying with them for a few days. We talked on the phone before she left, with her saying she couldn't wait to see all of us and spend time together. She gave us the time she was supposed to be over, and we said our goodbyes. We both recieved notifications from the app saying she had left her home, but hours passed with no word. My grandmother lived no more than fifteen minutes away from my folks, and even under the worst circumstances, would not take that long to get there. Anyways, using Life 360, we saw that she was parked along the side of a country road, and had been there for close to an hour. We managed to find her in the middle of the storm, her  car battery dead and her phone wedged under the seat. She had no idea we had tried to reach her or find her, and in fact was just thankful someone was there to pick her up. 

She's in a care facility now, and although she has no memory of me or knows my name, I'm incredibly thankful that Life 360 helped us find her all those years ago. Another decent program that helps with locating the people you love would be Tile. They've progressed a lot in the past couple of years and have multiple sizes of tracers, even ones that go in a wallet or can be just stick to things discretely. So, if your loved one doesn't keep a phone on them, but may keep a wallet, you can always slip one in with their personal belongs. 

Sorry about the long post, my grandmother is my everything and I'm just grateful to have had a few more years with her. Hopefully you find something that works for your loved one!
You can find trackers on Amazon. Slip it in his billfold, on the key ring, into his jacket pocket. I too wish you could chip them. I understand the moral dilemma, but we’re talking about people who can’t think for themselves anymore and who will never regain their ability to. It would help in so many cases. 

My friend’s partner took the car recently and ran out of gas on the interstate. She got out of the car and left it sitting there while crossing to get to the edge. Luckily, by the grace of whatever you believe in; no one was injured. 

She couldn’t even remember why she was in the car. My friend had stopped to go to the bathroom and she was gone just that fast. I’m lucky my grandmother doesn’t have a car anymore or the wanting to wander around. I can’t imagine having to deal with that too.

we got my dad a [Jiobit](https://www.jiobit.com/) that we can clip to his belt. he doesn't like it but better than losing him if he wanders off
Mf FIL has a tracker from the VA that doesn't work.  We did put a tracker on the car.  Verizon has a device for parents to watch new drivers.  We did that after he took the car once.

There is an alarm on the front door that goes off if he tries leaving that way.
There are insoles you can put in his shoes which have tracking technology. They are pricey but might be your best option as I'm sure he'll always put on shoes? Google 'GPS insoles'
We used a simple device with my dad called iTraq. It wasn't perfect but it was really affordable and we could clip it to his clothes (belt-loop or something)",2021-08-24 12:45:41,kappakingtut2,par3kc
Alzheimers,Predatory Marriage,"Tl;dr

Dad has alz stage 5

Lives with caretakers

Falls in love with longtime friend during pandemic

Changes personality and becomes hostile to fam

Friend moves into house n removes safety measures

They now intend to marry despite his clear decline and impending end

Fam in disarray

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My 77 year old dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in October 2019 and is now in stage 5. He lives with caretakers in his home, a condo in a senior living complex. 

He has developed sleepwalking symptoms and was found outside with no pants at one point, requiring his other son who lives closer to put alarms on the door and for Dad to wear a gps watch. The HOA  people have warned him that the next time he is found outside like that they will revoke his lease! 

During the pandemic he rekindled an old relationship and before you know it he had a girlfriend. Good for him - the old boy has plenty of lead in his pencil as his doctor buddy is prescribing him cialis (it helps alzheimers symptoms?) which powers up his hypersexuality, leading him to spend astounding amounts of $$ on porn. 

After about a year of dating he asks her to move in and he agrees. And this is where the trouble starts.  I know he is free to pursue love and happiness right down to his last day on earth. However, this man has been diagnosed with a progressive and terminal neurological disease and he needs care.

His girlfriend, a 70year old widow we will call N. has so far removed family photos from the wall, saying they bothered her. She removed the alarms on the door placed there to keep Dad from wandering off.  She forces his caretakers to care for her and her dog, causing constant conflicts with these wonderful and competent people. 

She takes him to her place and he stays long enough to miss med doses which isnt good for him. She acts like he is is a normal healthy 77 year old dude and will not dispense meds to him or act lIke a caretaker AT ALL. When questioned by my brother, she says she has no intention of wiping his ass. 

She is insisting on remodeling his apartment and moving his bed upstairs even though we moved it downstairs for his safety. The caretakers are there 24 hours - he plans to cut it to 12 as N will be there. She was with him but asleep when he sleptwalked a few times last month and peed in a sink. 

Dad and N went to his lawyers to draw up an agreement so she can legally move in within the next few weeks.

During the meeting he said they had been together for a year and after another year they would get married. Under normal circumstances, mazel tov! 

But these aren't normal circumstances. First off, he lied to her right off the bat, saying he had only mild memory impairment (MCI) even after he was diagnosed and voluntarily gave up his drivers license which is a huge deal here. Second,  he went to all the trouble of setting up a trust for his kids and grandkid and getting everything legally squared away. But his personality changed within that year and now I guess he has different priorities now?

As for protecting him with legal measures - the state of California is totes cool with alz patients signing on the dotted line as long as they can show they are competent by responding to questions from the notary public or other official.  

My Dad is very charming and could convince any one he is competent to get married. That prevents us from getting conservatorship and getting a restraining order against her. They are in love and love trumps all. Even a fam trying to deal with the long slow death of our Dad. 

There is nothing I can do as N. has totally brainwashed him to the point where he will get angry if you question him. We were supposed to be looking for a nursing home for him when he hits stage 6 - we are all aware of what is coming next for him. The only person that does not seem to know or care is N. I just want my Dad back.","Who is the power of attorney? It has gone too far.
This sounds very difficult. I'm sorry you're going through this. Who is the Power of Attorney? Potentially a conservator could be put in place because if he really is as progressed as you say I would think the courts would agree that he shouldn't be making big decisions like that. Good luck!
Dad and N went to his lawyers to draw up an agreement so she can legally move in within the next few weeks.

If he's got an attorney, you should reach out to him and explain the situation; see if he has any advice.

Also, curious, why would they need to draw up an agreement ""so she can legally move in"" within the next few weeks.  That seems suspect to me.
You need a conservatorship - this happened with my grandpa - they annulled the marriage and conserved him - but you have to file for this
My brother has medical poa but no one has legal. I don't know why he didn't get legal. We just got blind sided.",2021-08-23 20:24:54,COMMODOREXXX,pacf5l
Alzheimers,Confirmed. Now on Aricept.,"The wife's memory has been failing over 2-3 years. MRI and Cat Scans showed up nothing.

After insisting, GP gave us a referral to a psychiatrist specialising in dementia.

Initial consultation led to strong belief on Alzheimer's. Sent us for further tests, both nuclear medicine tests, SPECT and PET.

These tests showed up the temporal lobes plus the rear and top of the brain having diminished activity. In addition to memory, gait and balance would be impacted as well.

Gait, I have noticed already. This failing had led to a fall and a fractured shoulder. After 3 surgeries, all is healing. But 3 lots of general anaesthetic has not helped either.

On Aricept at the moment. Just working out correct dosage now.

Moral of the story, MRI and CAT scans do not always show up the dementia.

BTW, as Australians, none of the diagnostic tests cost us anything. All paid for by the Government.

BTW, wife is 71, I'm a bonny 59.","Oh, so sorry.  The diagnosis, then three surgeries, wow it's a lot, that's hard.  I feel for you!

 My dad had some surgeries in his 80's, the anaesthetic significantly messed up his brain for weeks afterwards - and he didn't even have memory-loss issues previous to that (it's mum who has the alzheimers diagnosis, they've been divorced since decades).  He couldn't recognise what a bar of soap was for, couldn't read or understand even headlines of newspapers, and had been an avid reader.  It was scary, doctors weren't even sure how much cognitive recovery he might make, he was also physically weak.   

 I did quite a bit of (amateur, internet) research re : rehab nutrition for elderly, put him on a fortified diet, got him series of rehab soft physical exercises, his physical as well as cognitive state slowly slowly came good.   *In addition to regular normal well-balanced diet*, extra protein in form of those Sustagen Hospital Formula-type drinks, Up&Go, extra VitC, multiVitamins -- just to give his body extra nutrients to repair with.   Some seniors eat like birds, hard for body to repair when they eat so little.  

For his mental recovery, lot of calm environment worked well for him.  Less confusion, radio or tv babbling wasn't good for him.  His old favourites music, sitting outdoors with interesting view in a park or some such, outdoor cafe on the edge not in the middle of too much activity - all seemed to work well for him.  It was tough as he couldn't read or understand much tv or play cards or engage in much conversation or whatever, and just sitting staring at the wall wasn't stimulation enough either.  Slowly got him onto simple puzzles n what-not.  He didn't like those adult colouring-books but mum likes them.  

Have you been in contact with DementiaAustralia .org?   They have tons of great resources & information on all aspects of memory loss issues, for the memory-lossed and their family / friends / carers.   They were of great assistance to myself & mum after her diagnosis.  I've been her carer for some years now.  Her progression has been quite slow-ish compared to many.   She's still living at home (me too, I moved back)  has govt home-care package, which includes twice-weekly social outings with other memory-lossed oldies, she really enjoys them, & it's great for me to also have time-off. 

 Take care of yourself, you also need time-off for yourself.   I hope have you got her an ACAT, for home-care assistance?  There can be quite a wait-list, but with alzhms diagnosis she ought to be eligible for some reasonable hours.  

 I wish you both all the best on the journey!
Love on her amap and love on yourself for being there.
Apply for benefits early even if you do not think you need them yet. Learned this the hard way.

Also make sure you have all your legal documents like power of attorney in order.",2021-08-23 03:29:28,pekak62,p9ut2z
Alzheimers,My Current Position,"I'm fairly new to reddit posts so I do not know how to exactly format this, but I still wanted to make a post. About two or three years ago my mom was first diagnosed with frontal variant Alzheimer's disease (fvad). Even before this diagnosis I had noticed that my mother would have irrational and spontaneous moments where she would lash out in anger. Whether it be coming home from work, taking me to church, or even just eating dinner. It's an odd thing to deal with this kind of stuff especially since I am only 19, and was first dealing with the situation at a younger age. The main issue currently is that my mother seems to be progressing further at an alarming rate. Recently I had heard that this could be directly related to having covid. A few weeks ago she was tested positive and since then things have been spiraling out of control. Currently my mother is trying to file for a divorce from my father and it is putting an overwhelming amount of pressure on me in the process. She even tries to play a child-like game of winning me in her favor. From an outside perspective I find no reason for the divorce to be even in process since someone with alzheimers shouldn't even be living by themselves. My mother has severe short term memory loss and it concerns me that if she somehow won the legal battle, she would be living alone. For example of such memory loss, my mother will repeatedly ask me questions concerning some of the simplest stuff like classes or even if she fed the dog. While I am at college I constantly get text messages and phone calls from both my parents and it stresses me out.

&#x200B;

Another difficult thing about this situation is that it seems like me and my father are almost crazy because we are the only family members who can actually recognize the change my mother has went through. Some of the family members on my mothers side even act like total assholes to my father and get up in his face. The legal difficulty about this is that my dad cannot just force them out of the house because my mother also owns it, thus she can legally invite whoever she wants over. On top of this, my mothers family members also have her help watch over some of their kids, and have her almost doing a 'task' for the benefit of themselves. It seems like total hypocrisy. Both me and my father fear that they may try to use her so that they may gain access to some of her assets. Something of which I find no reason for. With the progressing rate of alzheimers, we also worry that my mother may one day get lost. This happened to my best friends mother, and she was unfortunately killed while walking along the highway. On top of this, my best friends family was sued and lost a lot of money to the drunk driver who killed his mother. It's sometimes stupid how the legal system works.... The main point of my post though is to gain some outside information on how I might be able to deal with this situation in a more effective manner. Has anyone else had some similar situations happen to themselves? 

&#x200B;

 If I could get any answers in relation to advice on the situation, it would be much appreciated. Much thanks to those of you who read my full post!","Have your dad talk to an elder care lawyer.   There are steps to take now that will affect the future. 

Also, both of you find therapists now.  As time goes on you will need someone to vent to and guide you.   If family isn't there for the 2 of you you will need help.",2021-08-23 02:44:27,xCoronate,p9u937
Alzheimers,Just found out today my mom has Alzheimer's/dementia and at a lost...,So like the title says I woke up to a phone call from my parents and my.mom informing me she had been diagnosed with dementia. I don't even know how to process. She has been my biggest supporter in my.life and secretly the biggest deterrent when I was at my lowest to not take my own life. I have no idea what to do. I'm terrifies of losing the connection we have.,"I’m sorry to hear that. As hard as it is try to be their first her and focus on the greatness of your connection. 

You are strong enough for this challenge, there are many that have gone before you and many that will pull inspiration from your own experience to come. 

Much love.
The connection is strong, worry not. Even when my mother has no idea who I am, we have a laugh, she says the daftest things. Instead of focusing on the bad  (my mother has no idea who I am) I focus on the good (she is still able to communicate, her hallucinations are positive ones, and she is cooperative and not combative) All of these things can get way worse than they are right now but there is little point in worrying, I enjoy every moment I have with her right now.
I’m sorry to here this.  Silver lining is that your mom has accepted her diagnoses.  My mother refused to acknowledge she had it even when she completely understood that her mother had early onset.  This caused her to fight us every time we tried to go to the doctor to seek help.  It has not been fun.  Stay strong!
""I don't know who you are, but I know you love me.""  (Alzheimer's patient to a family visitor they didn't recognize.)

It will be a while (maybe months, maybe years) before your mom no longer recognizes you, but take comfort that even then, your compassion and affection will come across to her regardless whether she can cognitively put together how she knows you or where she is or the date, etc. 

If you share music connections -- songs & artists you both love -- those ties will remain a familiar connection throughout her disease, because (thankfully) the area of the brain that responds to music is one of the last to go. My brother is now in memory care and rarely recognizes me. We were closest during our teens, and whenever I play music we loved at that time, he lights up with smiles, and can even remember lyrics -- in spite of the fact that he can't even tell you his own name.

I recommend watching [videos by Teepa Snow](https://teepasnow.com/resources/about-dementia/), who's an expert in caring for dementia patients. Learn as much as you can about Alzheimer's so you recognize the behavior and understand what's happening to you mom's brain. It helps when you know what's happening so that her quirky and unexpected behavior becomes an amusing version of your mom rather than the doom-and-gloom evidence that your mom is ""messed up.""  She isn't messed up; her brain is dying in a predictable pattern unique to Alzheimer's. But her soul, her spirit, remain intact, although she will regress to childlike naïveté. 

When you grieve the loss of her as the anchor she's been for you, imagine her as a child who needs that security herself now. If you're not able to adjust to her changes and can't care for her yourself, it's OK. Many of us can't adapt to being a caretaker for our parents. You can still care for her by securing in-home care or finding a placement in a well-vetted memory-care facility.
As long as you’ve had a strong connection prior to the diagnosis you’ll still have it, and this isn’t going to be easy for a while but if you take care of yourself and find some healthy outlets and mental health support you will get through it. It’s going to become normal as you learn to accept the diagnosis, and you’ll adjust your expectations and behaviors, but I hope that you have a lot of time until then. She’s still that person for you. She’s still your mom and needs you in her life.
Well I would like to thank everyone for their responses. Unfortunately I got more information today that basically my mom was hiding the severity of her condition from us. My dad informed us that she has frequent episodes in the evenings where she forgets who he is, thinks he is an impostor, somehow thinks he uprooted her whole life in FL and imitated it in NC(we've lived in NC since 89). It already been recommended she no longer drives alone. And my dad is not exactly handling it all well.",2021-08-23 01:56:14,PanthersJB83,p9tmvj
Alzheimers,Lock for car keys,"We had to take the cars away from my MIL (patient) because she's been determined to be unfit for driving. My FIL wants his car back, but it can't be returned until he has a plan for keeping the key safe from MIL. We were thinking about getting a finger print controlled lock box for the car key. Do any you have experience with something like this and have any advice? Thank you!","Does FIL agree that MIL should no longer be driving & is he willing to enforce that? If not, no lock solution will stop enabling. 

If he is on board with the diagnosis, just a regular keycode lockbox where only he knows the key code will work fine. Putting it in a place she's unfamiliar with is also a good idea. (My mom forgot about the utility closet in her garage pretty early on.) 

Depending on the model of the car and how frequently they drive, he can pull the fuse that powers the ignition, that way, even if she manages to get hold of the keys, the car won't turn on. 

If you're worried about his enforcement, you might want to put a camera where they park their car.
Please accept my sympathies - this is such a tough situation for you.

In our case, we eventually had to first just take the keys to both their cars. Eventually, we had to remove the cars (out of sight, out of mind).  My dad still often asks when we are returning the car - we keep repeating that Dr has said he can no longer drive, and we're in the process of selling the cars.  He grumbles and sometimes gets very cranky - but honestly, I'd prefer he's cranky with us, than have him injure or kill someone.  He has NO insight into his condition.  Not to mention, the legal ramifications if he did have an accident (Dr said no driving, therefore insurance won't cover him).  

We explained to both M&D that the money we get for the cars, together with what they save on registration and insurance, can go into a specific 'taxi' account for them, so they can still get out and about if needed.

Alzheimers,Just Venting,"My mom, 56, got her official diagnosis, early onset (obvi) early to mid stage alzheimers, earlier this year. I first noticed symptoms 6 years ago, but it wasn't until last autumn when she got into her car and drove 2 states away, didn't know where she was or how to get home, that my dad finally agreed to have her evaluated. 
Since then it seems like she is progressing rapidly, the medication is helping with agitation, but thats it. 
They rent a beach house every year with an open invitation to us, which was last week. During the 1.5 days i was up there, I noticed she's started confusing my oldest brother for our other brother and my dad. She also wasn't sure of my name. I asked my dad if he was having someone come to house yet, he works full time outside of the home, to which he said no and brushed off. Then he's talking about next year hes going to rent a week at the same house for just the two of them then a bigger house for another week for us kids and our children to visit... im thinking like dad who knows if she's going to be able to make the trip next year.","[deleted]
I hope your father comes round. If she is at this point it could be detrimental for her health to be alone for large portions of time.
My mom started showing signs in her 60s and was diagnosed at 67. What I find is that there are moments it seems to progress rapidly and then it will slow to a crawl. We're going into year 12 this winter, and I wish it would hurry up. She's been miserable from the start. Her biggest fear realized, and it made her talk about suicide non-stop for years. Then she moved to the agitation and rage and attacked people, so they had to put her on Haldol injections, which isn't something memory care communities here could handle, so she was moved out of state. I don't get to see her as often as I was now, and the last visit found her in a wheelchair and barely talking. It saddened me to no end. Sometimes, I look at the cases where it progresses really fast and wish it was the case.
I can't even imagine what it will be like as symptoms progress since my mom was just diagnosed but my.only concern now is .making any memory she might keep a positive one because fuck this disease.
I hear you. Major virtual hugs. My dad was diagnosed with early onset when my parents moved in with me. My mom was in denial for a few years. Insisting that he had always been absent minded. It wasn’t until they moved in and I started spending long periods of time with them that I realized this was no normal. Even after the diagnosis, there was so much denial.
He is in denial. My Dad was the same with my Mom.  I don't think he ever came to terms with her condition before he passed.

Our experience was the doctors really didn't do a very good job of educating us on what to expect.

I hope you can find some resources that your Dad will pay attention to.

Alzheimers,Does anyone have an idea of resources in Michigan?,"My mother is her mom's primary caretaker and recently my grandma has gotten really bad. We don't know for sure if it's actual Alzheimer's or dementia, but she has regular mood swings to the point where she will be speaking (nonsense) in a normal mood and then immediately switch into the most hurtful and mean things we've ever heard. She tries to start fights with members of the house, she hoards loose chips under her pillows, and frequently leaves the house unaccompanied. She was getting in the car at one point but my mom and dad now hide the keys. Now she can't do that, she goes into the woods behind their house or will cross the street to the neighbors houses. Yesterday they found her underneath someone's porch.

My mom isn't sure what to do or how to get help. They've tried talking to doctors, and my mom is her power of attorney, but apparently the Doctor doesn't think she's a danger to herself. Just trying to help my mom get some relief or assistance, they can't afford to pay to house her at a facility that's equipped to help people like this.","It might be painful, but a call to the non-emergency line to your local PD or SD might be worth it, or a call to 411. 

However, if she has escaped supervision, it’s an immediate emergency worthy of calling 911.
Call one of your hospitals and ask if you can speak to or set up an appointment with the hospital social worker.
So, dementia is a symptom, that has many causes, and Alzheimer's is just one of them. Some causes of dementia are fixable and some, like Alzheimer's, are not. Because of this, if you think your doc is not being helpful, you should push harder. You could try asking a doc for a clearer diagnosis or more instruction. You can also try and get a second opinion, especially from a neurologist. 

You could find a support group in your area from groups like this: https://www.alz.org/help-support/community/support-groups
If possible its good to find a group near grandma, because they may know what resources or govt help applies. 
Alzheimer's assoc and sometimes Aarp have free education regarding dementia too. 
It looks like there are 2 chapters in michigan: https://www.alz.org/local_resources/find_your_local_chapter
Alzheimer's Association helps with all kinds of dementia, not just Alzheimer's, so dont be shy even if you're not sure what she has.
Keep in mind a lot of free support groups and education are online nowdays so don't give up if they are far from you. You could call the offices and ask for help, they may have some advice or literature to share. 

Your state has a decent looking page for dementia support (note Alzheimer's assoc and aarp are listed in their page): https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339-71550_2955_29193---,00.html

I would check out all the links on that page. They all look good. Heres a link from one of their listed websites you should definitely check out: https://www.midementiacoalition.org/resources/for-individuals-families . 

You should also find out if your state, county, maybe city has its own government office for ""eldercare"" "" elder care"" ""elderly affairs"" ""aging"" ""seniors"" or stuff like that. Sometimes smaller local offices have resources too. You might be able to find such and office more easily in your phone book, and be able to find out what they may have to help you by giving them a call. This will be especially true if maybe they don't have much of a web presence. I think a lot of rural areas or or towns are like this. 

Counties in the state i am in do things like pay for a day or two of day care, or provide some free in home assistance. Stuff like that. But every county is different, and sometimes theres a waitlist.

Alzheimers,I can't,"My grandmother  was diagnosed with early stages of Alsheimers last year, but her condition is getting worse by the day. For instance today she decided that she was to be wed to a stranger who has called her on the phone. I tried explaining to her that that isn't true and there is no one, but she got very aggressive - she tried jumping off the balcony, bit me  etc. The emergency hotline said they couldn't do anything. I have never felt more unprepared in my life. I'm incapable of taking care of her, but also I don't want to send her to a nursing home. She is the one who raised me and it feels like I am abandoning her, but I can't give her the proper care she needs. Can someone give me advice? She won't tolerate an assistant and I doubt getting her to a nursing home will be any easier. Thank you in advance.","I don’t mean to be a downer but you will need to get some outside help. A nurse or assistant to come into the home or something if you are not able to care for her yourself (which is NOT a bad thing and doesn’t speak anything of you. Being a caretaker is the hardest job I’ve ever had). It really sucked but we did eventually move our mom into a nursing home - we simply were not equipped to help her and it was dangerous for her and us
Her memories are like a box full of Mardi Gras beads. Dementia has rotted the strings so when she tries to pull out that one strand she ends up with a handful of random beads that she's trying to make sense of as they slip through her fingers. Telling her what the necklace should look like doesn't help when she has no string.

The best advice I've gotten is to just go with it. To them, their memories are true and trying to convince them otherwise is distressing, unsuccessful, and it will also make them distrust you. Focus on how what she recalls makes her feel (""that sounds very upsetting"" or ""I can imagine how sad/angry/excited/happy I'd be if that happened to me"") rather than whether it's factual, and gently guide the conversation into less disturbing territory if it's something that upsets her. It's a heartbreaking game of ""Whose Line is it Anyways?"" and it sucks.
You’ve reached the point where you can’t take care of her yourself. The attempt to jump off the balcony says she needs 24 hour care, and that’s something you can’t do. 

I made that decision back in May after my mom got angry one night when I tried to put her to bed, punched and kicked me, and ran outside, trying to flag down passing cars to call the police because her son “was being so mean to her”. It took me forty five minutes to talk her back inside, and that’s after having Seroquel prescribed for her after a similar incident at a supermarket a few months earlier. 

She was in respite care for two months while I unsnarled a few issues with funding, and found a place that could handle her occasionally violent behavior, and has Medicaid beds she can transfer into when her funding runs out. It’s been a big adjustment for me, and I’ve been dealing with a lot of grief this summer, but they can cover her needs 24 hours a day, and keep her safe when she acts out. I can’t. 

It’s not an easy decision, but you can’t keep her safe now. Do what’s best for you both, and start looking for a permanent placement.
When they try jumping off the balcony, or they bite their caregiver, is when you stop trying to do it all at home.

A common ruse is to say you are driving to a doctor appointment, but in fact you are dropping her off at memory care.

Are you getting any support for your situation?  Contact your local Alzheimer's society or aging agency.  They should have some strategies for you.
IF you live in a reasonable sized city you can get some help, there's many groups in all the major nations around the world helping caregivers.   


I found that my fathers transition was certainly aided by medication that included a low dosage antipsychotic medication.  It's made a world of difference in his condition.   


Diet and medication are critically important in treating this condition and improving the quality of life for both you and your parent.   


In my city there's a variety of support groups and organization that offer everything from legal advice, personal concealing, classes/advice and even help with respite care (so you can have a break)   
**I strongly recommend that you seek any and all such services out for yourself to see what is available.**
Talk to her Doc. My wife is much calmer on Clonazepam and Seroquelle (sp). Never argue because you won't win but distract instead. Want some ice cream or a cookie? Music is calming and if you can get it on a screen it is better. I have come to hate Jewel but my wife likes all those high notes.
I agree with the rest that medication does help. Seroquel helped my grandma calm down tremendously. Just make sure to dose properly or they will be very drowsy

Alzheimers,My grandmother was recently diagnosed with Alzheimers. Her condition deteriorated rapidly in the past 2 years since I left home.,"My grandfather moved the both of them to our city because he couldn’t take care of her by himself anymore. My grandmother had a hard childhood with a slew of mental health problems that went untreated for most of her life. She lost both of her parents by the age of 10 and grew up in a time when mental health was highly stigmatized. So, she never got help and became someone who lived very unhappily (depression, OCD, bipolar disorder) but still loved her grandchildren despite her inability to live with a clear, happy mind. I knew her this way as a child and into my teenage years. She was a workaholic who went to workout classes almost every day after work. She stayed up late doing dishes every night and spoke ill of the people who hurt her in the past, sometimes saying things to us we didn’t need to hear as children. I understand now that she wasn’t well. 

Years later, she doesn’t remember my name but she cries when she sees me and comments on how beautiful I am. She always preferred the granddaughters of the family, but I will admit it feels odd to receive such a warm and genuine hug from her after all these years, before which her tormented mind didn’t really know how to be in the present moment and enjoy time with her family. She used to be so fiercely independent, refusing to let anyone do the dishes after dinner, and now I am afraid to let her touch a dish lest it should fall and hurt her. 

Alzheimer’s is a harrowing disease. But I look at my grandmother, and I know she loves me, despite the memory loss. I think of the kindness in her eyes, despite the hardship she’s faced. This is all so strange to process. She is not like yesterday. And from here on out she won’t be.","wow ...  hugs  x

Alzheimers,Does this seem right? (Memory care center question),"Hello, 

My mother in law is in a memory care facility. My father in law is there 5-6 hours a day, 7 days a week, helping her. She also has serious gastro issues in addition to advanced Alzheimers. 

My FIL's neighbor just asked my husband if he could take over a day a week to give his dad a break. His mental health is low, low low. 

We visit every weekend and leave when she gets too tired. We can adjust to visiting for longer periods and helping more if needed.  This will include a lot of bathroom stuff, which my husband is dreading (but will do if needed, of course).  

With her gastro issues she's in constant pain and paired with her Alzheimers and OCD, is absolutely obsessed with bathroom stuff. For example, she is scared of going to the bathroom for nonsensical reasons. Last time I was there I was helping her in the bathroom and she was convinced a man down the hall would kill her if he found out she was going to the bathroom. 

Also, My FIL makes her eat and drink. She wouldn't otherwise. He calls doctors, makes appointments, advocated for her, etc.

I am just wondering if it's normal for a husband to have to do so much care in a memory care facility. I thought this is why she was there, to get more help for actually taking care of herself. Or is this a special scenario? Last time we beat FIL there and she just kept asking for him constantly. I think she was embarrassed. Why aren't the nurses at the facility helping her? Is it just too constant? 

We really had hoped that FIL would get to be a visitor. But he's Definitely still her primary caretaker. 

She is moving to a brand new, super nice facility in October. I am hoping it will help her, but we are worried she will be too far gone to even enjoy it. I just want to know what to expect in this nicer facility. Should I call them? This is so hard.","Hmm, that's an interesting set up. I'm not sure if all Memory care are this way but my dad's memory care (and all the others we looked at) include ALL care. It's all-inclusive, basically. Is it that your FIL is just wanting to help or is the facility requiring him to help?
Why exactly are they paying the memory care facility anything if they need the FIL to do such things. I am thinking you need to talk with them. I am sensing someone is over-volunteering because of love, or guilt, or just because, he will need sat down and told he needs to focus on himself if that is the case.
I can't speak directly to your situation, but my mom is in memory care and doesn't need anywhere this level of attention...at least not yet! The more kinds of care the staff are expected to give, the more they charge. My mom needs daily medication, help bathing and dressing (just one person to help her), and they have to remind her at mealtimes to eat. But they are always happy when family comes in to keep the resident company, help with day to day stuff. So it all depends on service level and what your FIL feels he needs to do.
I'd call and ask what services you're paying for. Although it could be possible your FIL insisted rather than let the staff do certain things?
The primary caregiver definitely still has a role when a patient goes into memory care.  For one thing, it is said that the most beneficial thing you can do to ensure good care, from even the best facilities, is to visit often and be involved.

Although he may be very drained by caregiving, it is an act of love and devotion to continue to urge her to eat, to support her through her pain and illness, and to advocate for her.  I would not try to interfere with that.

Can't the memory care staff provide the same support, you may wonder?  Well, in theory.  But they can't have someone sit close to her for hours at a time.  Errors in prescriptions, inconsistent interactions with staff, and other concerning issues are all too common.

Edited to add:  well THAT was strange, my answer lost at least a paragraph.  Wonder if this place is haunted?  I tried to say, your FIL should benefit by an occasional respite day.  The patient may resist this, but if both your FIL and the facility staff support the idea, she may come to accept it.  Routine is important to a person with dementia, so whatever change is instituted - such as a neighbor substituting - it should be as routine as possible.
Maybe they just assume at this point your dad will do everything since he always has? Maybe you should ask the director to get the staff to help more?

Just moved my dad into memory care. He’s in bad shape, so not nearly as functional as your MIL. My mom also goes over there 5-6 hours a day but she only feeds him and sits with him. If she’s not there for lunch, the staff feed him. They also take care of bathroom stuff, putting him to sleep, etc. 

They do try to leave us alone when we’re there to give privacy. So, maybe it’s just having your dad call and ask for help when she needs it or talking to the director to figure out a plan?
Many care facilities have reduced rates and then up-charge for what your loved one needs.  Perhaps your FIL is paying the lowest rate and doing the extras himself.  Can’t say I’ve seen this pricing structure for memory care though, all the ones I’ve visited had 100%, full care included.
Here, it depends on the rate set by the family. If you're paying a rent based on X hours with a nurse, say 1 hour per day, family members would have to chip in more. That said, with toileting and delusions as issues, I'd be shocked if the care home has her on minimal care. It's time for someone to talk to the director. The other issue could be if your dad has argued at all with the nurses over her care. I learned during a meeting that my older sibling tore into the nurses one day and had to be escorted off the property. Nurses were scared to go to help her if he was visiting.",2021-08-18 11:20:44,metrogypsy,p6tb4l
Alzheimers,venting + can’t sleep tonight,"TW// s**cide - not mine though

I should start out by saying: my mom and I have a relationship like a broken piggy bank taped together. My childhood was not a happy one. I forgive her trespasses in exchange for having a mother. She’s been abusive but less so than my other parent. 

I feel like it’s just all so much right now. My first day as a senior in college is tomorrow, technically today, and I want to be asleep, but I am up tonight thinking about my mom’s eulogy.

I am 22 and my mom was recently diagnosed with mid-stage Alzheimer’s. She’s also in renal failure. She doesn’t actively treat either. She goes to doctors appointments to track her progression, takes vitamins, and takes medication for her blood pressure/blood sugar (she’s diabetic) but that’s it. 

It’s been an absolutely fucking emotionally wrecked summer. She had a suicide attempt earlier this summer when she found out she was in renal failure. She watched her brother die from diabetes and was a nurse for decades, so she was horrified of going through dialysis. She had been abusing pills for years anyhow. When she attempted suicide, myself and my siblings didn’t even know about her kidney problems. She was on death’s door. My dad found her catatonic in the bed. She was in the ICU for days. Then we find out about the kidneys. And a week ago, it’s dementia. 

Plus, while I’m taking care of her over this span it’s punch after punch. She’s not drinking water consistently because she doesn’t like the taste and gets a UTI- then a kidney infection. She vomits. I feel awful for her. 

I am trying to speak with a therapist at school. I am taking 18 hours and working technically two jobs. Plus I (at least part time) take care of her on weekends. There are other times where I am her primary caregiver. 

I wish I could be a kid. My siblings are both a decade older than me. I am so so deeply frustrated with my life right now. 

I know all I can do is accept- but this is such a shitty plate to eat. I know life isn’t fair. I get it. I get it. I get it. It doesn’t make it any better. 

I want to know that my mom will make it to my graduation. I want to know that my mom will know who I am when I graduate.","Hugs to you, and best wishes for your school year. 

As a mom, I am going to give you a little advice I give my kids who are your age. Try to compartmentalize while you are at school or with friends.  You need that time to recharge and you need those experiences.   Times like these with parents suffering suck, and you are really young to carry that burden.  Dealing with all of it could rob you of experiences that I am certain she wants you to have. Take the time to enjoy the moments in your life.
Hang in there, bud.  Hopefully school will help give you a distraction for a bit.
Oh honey. I am so sorry that you’re going through this. My dear mama was diagnosed with EO when I was 14, it has been a long 11 years, I am now 25. 
I was my mothers unknowing caregiver from 11-14, so I understand the absolute frustration and agony you are experiencing. It is never easy, especially for those of us who had strained relationships with our parents before diagnosis. 
Hold on tight, reach out for help with support groups in your area and I would definitely seek therapy if that’s possible. Just remember you aren’t alone in this fight!
I'm not sure it's wise to set up arbitrary timelines in your mind, to wit, graduation.  Your  mother will die when she dies.  She will deteriorate mentally on her own timetable (not a conscious one, of course).  You do have other family so it is with them - and possibly your mother - you will be celebrating your milestones.

Best wishes.",2021-08-18 04:45:52,kushdaddy6669,p6n91u
Alzheimers,How can you enroll in a Simufilam study?,,"Here's a link that should help. 😀

Alzheimers,Great Grandma doesn't understand my metabolism. Is having horrible fits.,"I (23 f) am emotionally exhausted from being in the company of great granny (87 f) because she seems to lack the capacity to understand I can't gain the weight she expects.

For context, I'm from a mostly Puerto Rican family, we are blended with Dominicans as well. It's probably not even relevant what our race is, However there's this stereotypical standard of the latina body being curvy, thick, round, stacked or even just basically chunky and fat is expected and acceptable. This applies to my sisters, half sisters, my female cousin's, nieces, the daughters of my cousin's. Older and same age aunt's.  You get the point.

I am a string bean, petite and flat chested.  I just wasn't privy to having the same genetics. But it's fine. It's never been an issue for me or my family. Atleast until there was a change in my great grandma a little before I had turned 19. She confused me as one of my 12 year old nieces. The family would actively correct her though over time she would be bewildered seeing me in this ""condition"" when I visited. 

She accused family of not feeding me, worried if I wasn't eating enough. We thought it would remedy the situation if I visited my aunt and grandma more often to eat as they are her caretakers and grandma was a better cook anyway. I was happy to at first but it got tense why great gran wanted me to have a second plate of rice and beans or more potato or the extra fatty porkchop or another piece of plantain lasagna. I ate in abundance but I wasn't gaining weight because of course that's not how my metabolism works. This couldn't just continue, especially because my mom and half sister miss eating with me at our apartment complex. And sometimes the bus rides weren't worth the 15 minute commute.

I cut my dinner visits for a few days just to get phone calls from aunty explaining that great gran was actively looking for me to offer me food or desserts. I could hear her in the background calling for me, accusing grandma of not inviting me, sadly lamenting my absence when they put her on the phone with me. It breaks my heart.

We tried other options like switching things up and inviting other cousin's and adult grandkids so great grand could have plenty of company and liesurely get togethers with family. It worked for some time. But then it gets uncomfortable if she saw a ""flaca"" like myself among the visits and she'd go right back to demanding they are eating more or requesting to be on the phone with me because I have to make sure I come over right away so I can eat. I don't know what to do and I'm so worried if she's suffering with concern over something that can't even be helped.","The thing about Alzheimer's is that she is losing the ability to learn and retain new information. Especially if she has a stubborn personality to begin with. You're not really going to ""solve"" the issue. All you can do is deflect and distract and change the topic. You won't change her mind. You can say you already saw the doctor about your weight and they said you're healthy. Or if she insists, you can take an extra serving of food and immediately quietly package it up to take it home or split it with another family member. Say things like ""ok I'll do some research on that"". You could visit her in baggier clothing or sweaters and scarves that make your build less obvious and avoid the drama. Or you can straight up tell her you recently gained a bra size to make her feel better. Really there is nothing wrong with your body at all, but trying to convince her of that every time is just throwing your energy into a black hole. Understand she loves you and is concerned doesn't get how to show it properly. Then spend her last days talking about other things and avoid the topic altogether.",2021-08-16 18:50:11,Accomplished_Ad_4918,p5r4z5
Alzheimers,Keeping my grandma's wishes in mind,"About two weeks ago, my grandma (74) was diagnosed with colon cancer. Now the entire family has their input on what my mom and I, her caregivers, should do. They never talked to us before as she struggles with Alzheimer's.

It may seem really morbid but last wishes and death has always been a talking point in our family since I was a kid. So much so it comes up atleast once a week. Thankfully, because we talk about it so much I know what my grandma's wishes are when it comes to treatment. She has told me many times she doesn't want a colostomy bag, chemo, or anything that will keep her on machines for the rest of her life. 

I have already accepted her eventual death. We didn't think she'd live past 2017. It's been 4 years since then and we've tried to make the best of them we could. It still hurts to know this is probably the end but I'm ready for it. My mom is still getting there but not far behind me in accepting what will come. My other family wants us to do everything we can to keep her alive. They're blaming us for not doing more to help her. They've been distant for many years and offering no help whatsoever with her Alzheimer's and other medical problems.

I'm not sure how to end this but my mom and grandma go to the surgeon today to discuss options. I'll update if there is any major changes.","good for you for sticking to her wishes! she talked about it so much because it was important to her, you guys will make the right choice.",2021-08-16 11:51:10,melody436,p5itfw
Alzheimers,My mom can’t recognize her room/surroundings,My mom moved to assisted living 4 months ago because she woke up one day and no longer recognized her house as hers. (She was diagnosed in January 2021) She was convinced the people who lived there would come home and find her and call the police. At that time we decided to move her to assisted living. She still recognizes her family and most of her friends and can do self care for the most part so she’s not in memory care yet. Unfortunately for the last 2 days she has been very distressed because she does not recognize where she is again. I try to calm her and tell her to look around and see her furniture and pictures in the apartment. I tell her she is safe and loved. I have signs I made for her answering her most frequent questions posted in her apartment but that does not seem to be working anymore. Any suggestions to help her be calmer and feel safe?,"Unfortunately I don’t have any good advice other than what you’re doing with visual signs. My grandma was very similar and didn’t recognize her surroundings. She’d be fine in assisted living in the mornings but if we ever took her out she’d get confused when we came back. When she moved to memory care we eventually had to stop taking her out (this was right around when covid hit anyways). When we stopped taking her out she was able to adjust well enough. The socialization and having friends in memory care really helped and got her to not fixate on where she was living. When her friend got moved to a different facility is when the worries came back. I know this wasn’t super helpful but I hope there’s something you can get from it.
My mom keeps asking to go back to her childhood home- doesn’t seem to remember her actual home, which we moved her out of last year. She’s in my house now. 

Some days, explaining where she is works. Some days, telling her she’s visiting with us and going back to her childhood home works. 

Some days nothing works, which is fine too- she might be upset/confused, but it will pass.",2021-08-16 11:07:53,PiperE93,p5hxub
Alzheimers,Living with my girlfriend and her mum has alzeimers,I wouldn't usually post or reach out like this but I am not sure what to do in this case okay so about 2 years ago I started dating my girlfriend and moved into her mums house after a year and been here since so about 6 months ago her mum has been diagnosed with alzeimers at only 58 years old and me and my girlfriend are only 20 and we are having to pretty much take care of her and take her to appointments make her dinner and its affecting me being able to work fulltime because I come home to relax and the mother is just standing behind my qnd talking bon stop while I am trying to make my dinner and relax it is non stop issues and I feel like me and Mr girlfriend can't just get on with our life because we have been left to deal with this all on our own,"Yeah, this is called adulting. Sorry if this sounds a bit crass, but it's either deal with the situation or move out. Your girlfriend's mother didn't ask to become ill. But she is suffering from a horrifying illness that has no cure and will result in death. She needs care, and that need for care will only grow as the disease progresses. If you are unable to help provide that care while living in that woman's home, you need to think long and hard if you should stay there because it will only get worse from here. 

Meanwhile, talk to your girlfriend and together try to find every available scrap of (professional) help you can find for this woman in your area. And look at her and your finances thoroughly because at some point she will have to move to a care facility and depending on where you live this can be very expensive.
Hate to say it but this is the life of living with someone with Alzheimer’s and it is only going to get worse. Has your girlfriend started looking for help? Does she want to care for her mom at home or is there someone else who could step up to the plate? These are all questions that will need to be answered now. 

If she is going to be the sole caretaker then you need to decide if you want to stay in a relationship. This will only get harder.
I’m in the same boat, except it’s my mom- my gf is a complete saint for sticking through this with me. 

Yes, it’s like having another job to come home to. Yes, it’s asking a lot. It has absolutely changed our lives- but keep in mind that her mother is the one whose mind is betraying her, and imagine how scary that must be for her. My mom is mostly aware that her mind isn’t working right, and there are times when I can see how much it really scares her. 

These things can make or break a relationship- you do have to make sure you take good care of yourself and come up with ways to get time to relax- you won’t be any good to your gf or her mom if you’re burnt out. 

Either way man, I hope you stick around and help- for what it’s worth, I’d buy you a beer for all the help you’ve given already
Hey so you have been dealt a very difficult hand and I sympathize with you. At such a young age, not many of your peers will understand what you are going through.

You and your GF need a way to take care of your relationship. I would suggest couple's therapy if you can afford it.

The only way to tackle this is head on with 100% honesty and clarity. Seek out stories about how other people have dealt with this, how long it lasts. Understad all the stages of the disease and how it progesses. It's all different, but I think you really need to have a good understanding of what's ahead of you and how much you can take.



My mom had a stroke in my mid 20's and it greatly affected my relationship with my wife. Then my dad got Alzheimer's right after she passed. Our relationship couldn't handle it anymore and she left. I am equally angry and relieved for her that she is free. 

There's no fairy tale ending to this. It's a lot of work. It's hard to give you soothing words. Acknowledge that this is your life, and it's up to you to determine how happy you can be with it.
People are being a little harsh. Just because it’s difficult doesn’t mean you don’t have options. 

1) Are you collecting disability or any other benefits for her mom? Look into this, because this may help in either A) save up for the future if/when she needs to go into memory care, and/or  B) Hiring someone to help out for a bit once a week to give you a bit of a break. 
I would look into this and see what your options are. Look into this online to see where you can get more information.


Meanwhile, 

1) is there anything that keeps her occupied? TV, a puzzle, folding clothes, etc? Setting her up with that before you start cooking may help with the hovering. 

2) You and your girlfriend are a team, which means when something gets to heavy for one of you, the other can carry for a bit. It doesn’t always mean dividing everything 50% at all times. It means sometimes one person takes 100% while the other takes 0%, sometimes it’s 50/50, sometimes 70/30, etc. 
designate some alone time for each of you every week (or even every day, even if it’s short). One of you takes 100% responsibility for keeping her occupied while the other gets to relax. Plan out where you get to spend alone time based off what you need. If you need the whole house for a bit, ask if your girlfriend can take her on a walk for 20 minutes, or take her to the store or something. Then, when your girlfriend needs that, switch. 

3) Some cities have support programs or even places for day care. Contact her primary care doctor, social services, or your local community center and ask what services are available for you AND for her. Sometimes they have groups that will watch her for an hour a week. Sometimes they have support groups you and your girlfriend can attend. 

4) Ask for help when you need it, and try not to get discouraged by crappy responses. People on this thread can sometimes be harsh because they’re stressed out too. If you have any options for therapy, definitely do that. You can’t pour from an empty cup, so take care of yourself too.


Edit: I got a phone call and just sent what I had! Here’s the rest:

5) This won’t last forever. This is simultaneously a relief and really upsetting, but people with Alzheimer’s - especially early-onset, don’t live as long. They usually have a rapid progression for a few years and then die. It might be a tough few years, but there’s a light on the other side. 

6) Make sure she has activities. Anyone will go batty if they don’t have something to do. Preferably something meaningful (housework/ small tasks like unloading the dishwasher worked very well with my grandmother). Just some sort of entertainment she can follow well enough to keep her occupied. And obviously something she likes doing.
Hey, I can't really say much people above haven't already said. I went through this exact situation with my mother. She was diagnosed at 59 but it was very clear for years that she was suffering from some sort of disease. This is going to be hard. It Will be the hardest thing you have ever done, and it will be far harder for your girlfriend. What you are going through, will be so much worse because that's her mom. 
Some things you can do. Get a caregiver to come in maybe a couple times a week and give you guys that mental break you need. They can cook, clean, and also just distract her for a little bit. This will be good for both of you. Try to lean on family members maybe to take her for a few days. Talk to your employer and look at FMLA. 
And those times when it's just you and your girlfriends mom, maybe find low energy activities to keep you both active. I highly suggest sorting multiple decks of cards, or playing music she likes or grew up with. Puzzles are great also.
I wish I could tell you to do this one certain thing, and it will fix everything. It won't. This is going to get worse, but if you and your girlfriend are there for each other, and her mom, it will be easier if only slightly.
Not sure what advice your looking for exactly. As others have said, you have a decision to make. You're either willing to help, or you're not. But your GF's mother's health and well being is the priority.

It's tough to be a care giver, that's the reality of it. If you are not willing to take on the responsibility of helping, then you need to be honest with your girlfriend. Your frustration and stress will only make it worse for your girlfriend, and her mom.

If you are willing to help, then I suggest routine is your friend. Set up a routine/schedule as much as possible. This will allow you to try to plan your time, know when thing are happening, and hopefully help you anticipate and structure your free time as well.

Hope that helps.
I’m sorry it’s affecting you and that you are young. She took you and your gf in. Now she needs you.  Your gf should look into getting POA and call elder services for advice and any available help. Hopefully you can help and stay in the relationship. Otherwise, you have to move out. Relax is not a word that’s in a caregiver’s vocabulary unless there is respite care of some sort.
This is me as well and my girl has been a solid saint dealing with these things with love and care like it’s her own mom. It’s not always easy but she has empathy for me and my mom. 
Sounds like your girlfriends mom is trying to keep busy and be sweet. I think you guys need some help with care at home but I had to quit my job to take care of my mom while my girl works. It’s how life goes and that’s a part of her life and you either have to be strong and get through it with her if you love her that much. 
You have to remember that they didn’t chose this illness and it’s much harder for them. Not saying it’s not hard for you, but if you love them stick through it and make a good schedule for you all so you have some time for yourselves.",2021-08-16 01:05:41,Physical_Throat_3121,p59gwy

Alzheimers,Seeking Technology To Help My Grandmother And Other Family Members,"My only living grandparent is my grandmother, she is 94-year-old, she experiences some dementia, and she was hospitalized last winter due to pneumonia.

The staff at the hospital left her unattended for too long at one point, and she ended up falling and experiencing a concussion. 

As a result, she experienced a blood clot in her brain, which was thankfully addressed via surgery.

However, due to the surgery and other variables, she has lost some of her ability to walk, and her legs are not as strong as before.

She now completely depends on some of my aunts and other family members, and they have been overwhelmed by the process of caring for her.

They may be in the process of hiring someone to help them from time to time, but I am not sure when that will come to fruition.

With that said, please recommend any forms of technology that my family can invest in, that will make the process of caring for my grandmother easier on my family.

Your help is greatly appreciated.","Portable music player like mp3 player, loaded up with songs she likes from her teens to 30s. She can still enjoy it even long after shes not responsive to other things, and it can improve her mood if shes agitated.

Alzheimers,Grandmother has Alzheimer’s and has suddenly decided my very irresponsible uncle should be her POA instead of my mother.,"My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in January. Her doctor graded it as moderate to severe. She and my mother had a financial POA contract drawn up and signed it. I am the backup on the POA contract in case my mother doesn’t fulfill her role as POA.

Meanwhile, my uncle has been desperately trying to take advantage of my grandmother. He and his wife don’t work and live off of government assistance and handouts from local churches. They have had many issues with CPS over the years. As soon as my grandmother was diagnosed, he started getting her to give him money, buy him things, etc. He convinced her to give him some family heirlooms also, including some WW2 guns that belonged to my great grandfather. Then he got her to agree to let him have some of her land, worth about $40,000 and co-sign for him to buy a trailer for it. Luckily, my mom let him know that he can’t do that without her signing off on it. He and my grandmother are both angry that my mom is preventing this. 

My mom and I have noticed that my grandmother has been sort of distant from us the past couple of weeks. Then today she told us that my uncle took her to see a different attorney and she going to make my uncle her POA. My mom asked her if she told the attorney about her diagnosis. My grandmother argued that she doesn’t even have Alzheimer’s and that we are lying to her. 

I think my uncle has convinced her that nothing is even wrong with her. I think that he is telling her what she wishes was true so that she will be more helpful to him. 

Mom and I don’t want her money or land either, because we assume it will all be needed to pay for her care. She’s only 72, so young to suffer from Alzheimer’s. We probably have a long road ahead. But if she truly doesn’t want one of us to be her POA that’s okay, it’s her life, we just don’t think my irresponsible uncle should do it. 

Do you guys have any advice? Can she make my uncle her POA at this stage in her Alzheimer’s? Is there any option other than paying an attorney $300 an hour for finding a solution to this? If we can’t afford an attorney can the state appoint someone to be her POA? 

We are new at this and we don’t really know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated!","I dont think she can, without you guys signing off on this. Get the help of the lawyer who set up the initial poa with you guys, and contact your state or county dept on aging and see if they have an ""elderabuse"" dept or guidance. You can also see if your local univ law school has an elderabuse dept that can offer community help or education or even discounted services. Finally, consider posting on r/legaladvice . but first id contact the lawyer that help you set up original poa.

Edit: yeah im a creepy post history readin stalker. 

https://www.tn.gov/tdfi/consumer-resources/financial-education/elderly-and-vulnerable-adult-financial-exploitation.html
In our area, there is an Area Agency on Aging that can guide you.

If you cannot find a state or county agency to clarify your duty and responsibilities as POA, consult a lawyer. This meeting should be charged to your mother's estate.

Once a person has dementia, the power of attorney is set, and cannot be changed unless the POA wants out or serious malfeasance. 

You have a responsibility to protect your mom from abuse and theft by deception (by your uncle). Her funds should be dedicated to her remaining life, and needed healthcare.

You may need to get a restraining order against your uncle to stop this BS.
Call APS and report Elder Abuse. You may also want to file for a conservatorship/guardianship. Unfortunately you really do need to seek out an attorney that specializes in elder law. If you file for a conservatorship your Grandmothers estate can pay the fees to the attorney.
"" If we can’t afford an attorney can the state appoint someone to be her POA?""

I don't think they appoint POA, but better to ask an attorney. My attorney said that if I didn't intervene and do the conservatorship, the folks that were scamming my mother could drain all of her money and she could end of a ward of the state in a state-run home and that I may never see her again. I don't know if he was trying to get his point across but believe me, we took action.
Depends if she has been deemed incompetent? If not she can do as she pleases. If she has that’s a different set of rules. Lawyer up ASAP.
Consult an elder law attorney.  Don't guess at the legalities on your own.

Grandmother clearly is unable to make rational decisions, so it could be challenged if she changes POA at this stage, but legal battles can be costly.
Get a new lawyer. No responsible lawyer will allow her to sign a legal document if she appears demented. This happened to us when I tried to get my mother to sign a POA, and the lawyer said she wasn’t competent. We had to go to court to obtain guardianship.",2021-08-14 18:16:12,FortuneAndFae,p4hbyg
Alzheimers,My mom was talking to the wall to her 'neighbors' and cooking a meal for someone who isn't real...,"This is the worst she has ever been in front of me with me physically there. She refused to go to the pet store to get food for her cat because 'they' told her she can't go now, and then she proceeded to talk to 'them' through the wall. This was such a shock to me as I had never seen the paranoia/ delusions exhibited so openly. What am I supposed to do? I tried to calm her down and then left, and Im going to get her cat food and deliver it to her, but feeling very scared seeing this so openly.","She can’t live alone any more, and you might want to take the cat to your place or another safe home so it’s not neglected or worse.  

We got to the point with my mother that we had to either live with her (not an option) or hire caregivers.
It sounds like she will need a full time live in caregiver or to live in a facility. At this point her health and safety (and that of her cat) are at risk.
Its time to take her to get some proper care and help. Nothing wrong with what you're doing at all:) Just too many things that can go wrong without professional help.",2021-08-13 15:52:02,DRT798,p3spie
Alzheimers,Caregiver for parent w/ Dementia vs. Career,"Has anyone given up on their career to be a caregiver for parent with dementia ?   

I am single and no kids.  I can financially afford it for a few years and feel like my mother might be in nursing home in 2-3 years and think it is hard to measure the time I can spend with her now while she still knows me versus what she may be at in 2-3 years.","Just sharing my experience with you. I left my career in 2012 to take care of my wife's grandmother while my wife and mother in law continued their careers. After the first year of me being the primary ""babysitter"", my wife had to leave her career to help me and her grandma while her mother continued to work. During this time we would take grandma to Adult daycare to give us a much needed break. 

My family believed that we could kick Alzheimer's ass by taking care of grandma. Alzheimer's does what Alzheimer's does and there's nothing you or love can do about it.

My mother in law, wife and I pressed on fighting to keep grandma out of Assisted living or memory care. We weren't going to be those people who abandoned their loved ones by placing grandma in a home. There was so much confusion, hurt, anger, crying, distrust, and love in our daily life. 

Once grandma couldn't recognize her own home (purchased new in 1966 and never moved) and kept asking to go home and see Mother, is when my mother in law and my wife started searching for a memory care facility.

With much hesitation we found and placed grandma in a facility. We still believed that Grandma was mentally here with us. 

She was not mentally with us anymore. 

Placing grandma in a home was the best care we gave her. Hindsight being 20/20, we would have placed her sooner. She lived out her remaining life being loved and cared for.

Placing your person in a home doesn't mean you are a bad person, just the opposite, it shows that you care. 

I am now starting this process with my Dad.

Show them you love them with your kindness.
Caregiving will grind you down. DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP!

Thank you. Spend as much time with your mom as you can handle. It's going to be hard. She still has so much to teach you. You might not know what the lesson is or was but in time you will see it clearly and it will humble you. 

 Tell your mom that I'm sending love her way. I want you to know that you are are a good person and this world needs more people like you.

Don't be afraid to ask for help.
I did but now i'm almost broke but it was better than spending $3000 or more for a care home. She died 2.5 months ago.  I would do it all over again. I love my mom.  She died at 95.",2021-08-13 12:24:41,sportsguyred,p3oids
Alzheimers,Dementia + Sick - how do you take care of parents ?,"How do you take care of a parent with dementia who is sick all the time?   My mother has early stage dementia and heart issues, kidney issues, and other medical issues.

She needs someone to do her pills, make sure she take pills, go to doctors appts, talk to doctors on phone, go to have labs,  etc.    

I am physically and mentally beat up.  I do not think having a visiting nurse come will help much because my mothers meds chaneg all the time and she has 10 different doctors that call and so ultimately will not really save me time a I will have to go back to talk with doctors, etc anyways.","Dang I skimmed your post history and it gives me stress! I feel for you and I hope you can somehow piece together the help you need. 

Ok, are you in the united states? If yes, a lot of times states and/or counties have an area office on aging (and sometimes other public health offices or departments or non profits that can help with any other chronic illnesses that might be in your life). If you are not familiar, i would google the name of your county, along with terms like elderly, eldercare, aging, and senior. Some local govts may have pages or divisions or programs specific to dementia or Alzheimer's so i would add that into searches too. Or add in the word ""caregiver"" to your searches.  If you're lucky, sometimes they might have programs that might pay you for being a caregiver, or offer free or discounted access to day care or respite care. The county office on elderly near me covered day care for a couple days a week and in home visits to help give my Alzheimer's family member baths, free of charge. 

Since you say shes in early stages, it may be too soon for her, but hospice care can also be helpful and cover a lot of costs and services, including respite care. 

Sometimes areas have nonproft orgs, often affiliated with churches ( but you don't have to be a member to get help), where volunteers can help with minor stuff, so you can focus on things that they are not qualified to help with. For example a group of churches near me (of different denominations), collectively have a pool of volunteers. They can do stuff like help with groceries, cooking, feeding, laundry, stay with the elderly as a ""companion,"" and other domestic things, so you can do stuff like talk to doctors and just take care of yourself and more complex things. Maybe state or county govt offices in your area have stuff like this too i dunno. 

I'd look for an Alzheimer's Association and maybe AARP or similar associations nearby. They will have things like support groups and free education. Nowdays a lot of the help is online bc of covid. Its good so you don't feel alone, but also hopefully you cam find a group that have people who live *in the same area* as you, so you can find out what other resources or recommendations they know of that are specific to you and where you live.

So these are examples from my area (hawaii): 
Govt page:
https://www.elderlyaffairs.com/
This is a handbook that lists a lot of resources including volunteer groups: https://www.elderlyaffairs.com/site/449/publications.aspx#Senior%20Handbook

My county pages for elderly are not great, so id look up county offices in the phonebook and call and see what they have to offer. I had to call mine to get help at the time i needed it bc thier web presence was sparse. I think this will be especially true for people who live in rural areas. But whats good about that is that there will be less competition for resources. The county next to me was dense and urban and there was a waitlist of over a year for some services. Each county can be different. 

My state doesnt have a robust dementia dept, but california does, as another example: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DCDIC/CDCB/Pages/CaliforniaAlzheimersDiseaseCenters.aspx
California has a nice looking page for caregivers in general too:
https://www.aging.ca.gov/Programs_and_Services/Family_Caregiver_Services/

The point is to check for both state and county websites and phonebook entries for help in your area. 

Here is the Alzheimer's assoc support group finder page: https://www.alz.org/help-support/community/support-groups
But you might consider seeing if your local branch has a facebook page that they might update more often. Or just call. 

Most of the free help you can get will likely exclude the actual administering of medicine, and the restraining of someone who wanders. But you can maybe piece together a team to help with other things that take your time.

Anyway sorry for rambling. Good luck.
Try to pare the Doctors down. 10 is WAY too many. Do a thorough survey of her meds and see what you can do about paring those down as well. My Dad had dementia, diabetes, neuropathy and was an above-the-knee amputee. In addition to that, his spine was closing on his spinal cord so for a while, until surgery, he couldn't do a single thing for himself. He was on LOTS of meds and we noticed they were not being monitored by all of the different doctors we dealt with, so we started over with 1 good GP and a good exam. It helped a lot. I had to move in with them for about 7 months until my mom could do it all herself and dad started progressing physically a bit. You just do it. One thing at a time.

I've recorded my mom with my phone, but, since I live hours away, a lot of it is done over the phone. What I do is I have a google doc open, put her on speaker, and she talks and I type it out. I'm glad I do have an audio recording, since I wanted to make sure I had something of her voice.

As the disease progresses, it's been more difficult, and I can't really do it anymore, but sometimes she will randomly go into a long ago story, so basically anytime we talk now, I have that google doc open nearby just in case.

Alzheimers,Hear about the latest scientific breakthroughs and discoveries...,,"Okay, to talk about a ""cure""is to give false hope intil you can regenerate neurons with the protein encoding for ""data"" which is the coding for what makes ourselves.

*As such I find this statement quite disingenuous.*

The best you can hope for is to arrest the progression at the point of effective treatment.   But it's very future tech and sci-fi to hope for SOMETHING that can serve as a backup of the information that actually makes us a person  and then to have that back encoded into the new matrix.

**I'm sorry but it's lame pedestrian shit like this that wastes peoples time.**

Alzheimers,My Dad just got diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers .,"My dad is 57 and was just diagnosed yesterday. He was also told he has brain plaque. He's seeing a neurologist in a month to get more information. I know all cases are different but could anyone give me a rough idea of how long I might have with him . Right now he does have any severe signs of it , hell go out to his car and forget his phone or something and on occasion hell get tongue tied but I would say its very mild at this point. How fast does this progress and how long could I have to be able to do things he still enjoys before he is no longer capable. Thanks !","I believe the average life expectancy is about 6-8 years from diagnosis. Each person goes in their own journey so the progression is different for everyone. Enjoy the time now. Please make sure to get a power of attorney done as well as a will and other legal documents he may need going forward.
I am so sorry about your dad. It is hard to know, because everyone is so different but a very fair question to ask. My mother started showing signs around age 58, she lived alone and didn’t end up getting a diagnosis until she was 63. I mentioned that she lived alone, because I think without someone there day to day none of us really knew what was happening. She sounded fine on the phone and on there occasions we would see her. But we did start to see changes around age 60. She turned 70 this year and she is now in stage seven of Alzheimer’s. I have the same question as you, will she live 4 more months? 3 years?? I wish I knew. It’s very tough.
It sounds like he is in the very early stages, as far as my experience can tell. It's a very tough road ahead. My father was a very smart man but we began to notice that he was becoming more and more repetitive and forgetful. About a year or two after we noticed he was faltering, he started to believe there were multiple women in his house (it's only my mother) and wasn't sure ""who was who"". From there, his mood declined and he forgot many of his social graces, for which he was previously excellent. This was difficult on all of us, because it comes across as intentionally rudeness, which it obviously is not. Geriatrics have not yet formally diagnosed him, but he's clearly in the mid to late stages and he is defiant (and in denial). The thing I am most proud of and thankful for is that I always treated his repeated and non-sensical questions as legitimate and valid. He trusts me more than anyone and I still get some very tender moments with him, even though the disease can make him a total prick",2021-08-10 11:44:27,grahamreaper,p1rt8p
Alzheimers,Potentially both parents with dementia,"Hi - my mum was officially diagnosed with Alzheimers a couple of years ago, but her cognitive decline had been evident for some time. Overall, it seems to be a steady, but slow decline.   

We were all so concerned and attentive towards mum, that we just didn't notice the decline in dad, or put his occasional 'confusion' down to being tired, or a little worse for wear (ie he did love a drink).

Now, it's becoming apparent that he is also headed down the dementia path, and we are waiting for his official assessment.  The trouble is, I think he has a different type of dementia - perhaps Lewy Body or frontal lobe dementia.  He gets very frustrated and loses patience incredibly quickly nowadays (he used to be a very patient man), and he seems to have lost a lot of empathy towards mum; sometimes he just talks rubbish and I can't figure out what he's on about; he gets up in the middle of the night, convinced he needs to shower and dress for an appointment.

My biggest problem at the moment is that he and mum are driving each other crazy!  Part of mum's behaviour is obsessing about things, and she won't let dad out of her sight for very long, scared he will fall over and hurt himself.  There's a history of this, so it's not an unreasonable concern - but she follows him around constantly, and it drives him nuts!

Mum's also exhausted, because of dad getting up throughout the night - but she won't sleep in another room, as she's too scared he will get up and fall over, and she won't hear him.  So, with mum being extra tired and dad being extra impatient, they are constantly arguing and bickering - apparently a few nights ago they had a serious screaming match ... but neither of them can recall what exactly was said or by whom, just that they were both upset and that it was the other's fault.  So fat, my sister and I have heard several versions of what triggered the intense argument, but as the stories constantly change, we simply don't know who or what to believe..

My parents are, at this stage, refusing to go into any kind of care in any capacity - not even for respite.  According to them, there's nothing wrong with them, they just forget a few things (!) and get a bit impatient with each other.

My sister and I do have PoA and Guardianship; we've stopped dad drinking; we've taken both sets of car keys and we're trying our best to manage them - but jeez it's f***ing hard.  Both parents are in their early 80's.

Has anyone else had both parents develop dementia?  Do you have any suggestions/opinions on how we might move forward?  FWIW, we're in Australia.

Thank you for reading this far ... apart from anything else, I needed to do a bit of a verbal dump ... this shit is just so exhausting and overwhelming.","My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s 7 years ago and my mom was diagnosed with dementia this year. She was hiding It from us, but she finally admitted she started noticing signs four years ago. I moved them both closer to me. They are both in different facilities since my dad is far more advanced than my mom. I will be moving him soon into the same place as my mom  but they will be on different floors. It’s been so hard and I totally know what you’re going thru. The good thing is you have your POA all settled. The paperwork and all the medical paperwork is so tough. I’m constantly like It would be so much easier if It was only one parent so I could have the other parent to help me with decisions. It’s not fair and I’m sorry you guys are going thru this. My family sort of just dumped all the responsibilities on me and my siblings are no help at all. It’s great you have your sister to lean on.
Phew, you are definitely going through it, I can't imagine wrangling more than one dementia parent at a time. I only have experience with the one so someone else may come along and offer better advice. 

Find a routine that can suit them both. Routine is important and once you get it nailed, things become easier until the next stages. Think about getting a commode that you can put inside the bedroom for your dad to use, your mother may not worry so much about him falling over if she can see him at all times. If this isn't suitable you could look into penis sheaths/catheters, he can wear it when he is in bed and relieve himself without getting up and waking mum. Consider bed rails, walking frames, sticks, anything to give him more stability. See if you can find activities to keep your dad busy in one location, like sitting to do a very basic jigsaw puzzle (if he is still able). Music can be a great calming influence for people with dementia/alzheimers. Put on something from their childhood or their favourite relaxing music.

I hope you manage to find a solution, take care.
I’m so sorry it’s been so difficult with just one parent I can’t even imagine with both. I wish I had some advice to give but I just want to send hugs and strength xx
I’m so sorry you and your family are going through such a difficult time, it is a truly heartbreaking disease and affects not only that person, but also everyone around them. Both of my parent in-laws have been diagnosed with dementia in the last year, and to say that it has been difficult would be a true understatement. They were living in an independent living facility and were kicked out after a year because my dad in law was harassing the workers so much, and forgetting how often he was bothering them with the same issues. The boot finally came when he came to the employees at their residence saying he couldn’t handle his wife any longer. And this was before things got really bad. 

We have since moved them to our city into the best retirement residence money can buy in the area. The positive aspect of this place is that there is memory care on “the other side”, where my mom in law literally just moved to a week ago. It has been a disaster emotionally, but absolutely the best thing for her, for she cannot care for herself properly. Part of the reason she moved was because they too were arguing a lot and my mom in law started wandering the city, getting lost because she was tired of my dad in law nagging at her for everything. She moved the day after she went missing for the final time. Police, search & rescue got involved, it was a nightmare. Thankfully she was found and was okay, but the move was imminent for her after that final incident.

I think the big issue at hand is that your parents are refusing help, and not willing to acknowledge there is an issue. I think a very positive thing is that POA is already in place, as well as guardianship AND taking away their car keys is a huge step in the right direction. From what I understand, at least where we live, POA can have grounds to admit someone to special care, if the situation permits and doctors can attest that the individuals are not of sound mind. I understand you live in Australia, so things might work differently there. I also believe there are different levels or types of POA, so I’m an unsure where you stand with that. If it’s getting to the point that they can no longer care for themselves, then I think intervention must happen. 

I know my dad in law to this day is in denial about his condition and often accuses us of “lying” when we tell him a lot of things that pertain to his memory and behaviours. My mom in law, whom is now in memory care, also does not understand why she is in a locked facility, but they unfortunately hold no grounds for having a say in the matter, as they are NOT of sound mind. 

It started small. We took over their banking and coordinated their appointments, got doctors and lawyers permission to take the control that was necessary for them, as they could no longer manage on their own. We sold their car and had his license revoked, which was heartbreaking, but we noticed he had many new dents in his otherwise pristine vehicle that he wasn’t even aware of. He also almost got us all into an accident when he was driving us to the ferry when we were leaving their former city after visiting, which happened before he was officially diagnosed. That was the last time he drove his car. We also originally hired a caregiver to come in a few times a week to help with bathing and other basic needs, although that didn’t last long because their dementia advanced at an alarming rate and soon, much more care was needed, hence us moving them to our city, where they are much closer to family. 

I honestly don’t know what the best solution is for your situation, for every situation and individual is unique. It does certainly sound to me like they need some sort of family intervention so they can be made aware of how much their current state is affecting everyone around them, especially themselves. I’m not saying it will work, but it’s worth a try. I’m sorry they are refusing any sort of help, for help is certainly what they need at this point. 

It is HARD!!! Nothing about this situation has been easy and my husband and I are both emotionally and mentally burned out for they depend on us so damn much for everything. But it’s baby steps, and time will tell when the day comes they will have to move to extended care. You will know when that day comes. I’m glad you got a hold of your dad’s drinking, because that can be a potentially bad scenario. And it’s steps like that that move you in a positive motion towards better quality of life for everyone involved. 

It takes a lot of patience, time, work, and dedication  to get things moving like a well-oiled machine. I wish I had better advice for you and I’m sorry I cannot be of better help for you. What I can say is that you and your family must work together on this, it takes an army to make things work! Unfortunately my husband’s other siblings have taken a completely hands off approach and so the burden has solely been placed on us. 

Every day is different, and there will be good days and bad days. But at the end of the day, if they are refusing help and if you have no authority to get them to extended care, then there is only so much you can do. All you can do is offer your support and be there for them as best you can. One thing I noticed is how rapidly my in laws state advanced. So even if they are refusing help now, things might be different and evolve as time goes. I’m not saying all cases advance rapidly, but for us, we knew when the time came for them to go into proper care. 

I wish you the best of luck! My heart sincerely goes to you, for I know how bloody tough it is to have not one but two parents with dementia. They may not be my own blood, but they are my second parents, and I love them dearly. 

It is VERY important to take care of yourself and maintain your boundaries. If they are asking a lot of you while refusing help, then (dare I say it) taking a step back is sometimes not the worst thing. Again, I do not know your situation, so I will not say for sure that is what is needed to be done, for they very well might need as much help as possible. I just know in my own situation, mostly for my husband, he HAS to have firm boundaries with his dad, or else he calls 40+ times a day every day, demands things, and expects too much when we are already spread so thin. We take care of everything that needs taking care of and ensure they always have proper care, but in other areas, we have had to take a step back so as to maintain our own sanity. You gotta put that oxygen mask on yourself first!! 

Other commenters have great suggestions here that I totally agree with, so I will not repeat them. Routine is huge though, and it helps to get them established in a better place both mentally and emotionally. I’m grateful for the space my in laws now have from each other, but of course now that they are separated, they miss each other dearly. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side. 

Take care, and best wishes!!! I hope for the best for you and your family. ❤️
Dementia is a beast in all its forms. Since you're in Australia, is it possible you may find a doctor that specializes in \*reversing\* dementia and its symptoms? **Make no mistake: this is NOT a cure;** however, results from scientific studies from the past 20 years are incredibly promising to include a book that has been invaluable to mom and I called: The End of Alzheimer's by Dale Bredesen, MD.

Please know I have ZERO financial or other interest in this book and I don't have any personal connection to Dr. Bredesen or his team. All I care about is helping my mom (who was tentatively diagnosed with Alz two weeks ago) and am an only child who plans to not be Alz case #7 in our immediate family and dad died from confirmed Alz in 2017.

With this background, find out of you and your sister can take them both to see a functional or integrative medicine specialist (licensed physician) who specializes in dementia prevention and treatment. Since they are early in their diagnosis, this is the best time to start and they can give you advice on how you and your sister can protect yourselves as well considering family history with optional (but highly recommended from own experience) genetic testing.

Am not sure how Australia regulates its medical professionals (including doctors) but always check with their licensing boards to ensure they are practicing in good standing whenever possible because quackery abounds (especially in the integrative and functional medicine fields) because they are relatively new and there are unscrupulous people who will take advantage of fear without basing their opinions upon any actual peer reviewed scientific research. Y'all only want the ones who do!",2021-08-10 08:37:30,Megan2153,p1obpq
Alzheimers,Assisted Living to Memory Care,"For those that have moved their loved one from assisted living to memory care, was there a new behavior or something else that finally cemented the decision to do the move?  I'm putting off memory care as long as I can (almost double the cost) but obviously safety and well-being is the first priority.","Mum went from Independent Living straight into Memory Support. Not living in the same city, it was hard for us, her kids, to notice the changes. Any strange or odd request from her over the phone was easily brushed off. What we didn't know, or at least I wasn't the contact person, is that Mum was found multiple times in the wrong hallway, lost, trying to make her way back. The workers there are obliged to report odd behaviors so there was a paper trail, and apparently her record was extensive. 

I talked to her friends in the middle of moving her, and they all said, Yes, it's time. It's time."" There were sticky notes to herself around her rooms, like how to operate the washer and dryer, and there was trash (paper) in the dishwasher. Over all, everything looked pretty normal, but workers say they get really good at hiding things, like saying, ""Hello there!"" when they don't recognize someone.

I have no idea how long she was struggling to be normal. She's in the Skilled Nursing wing now and doesn't recognize me.
We placed my dad in assisted living with a memory care floor. He had attendants several times a day and a memory assessment every six months or so. We were guided by the facility. When they said he was declining, we took him to the doctor again. Once we (doctor, family, facility) determined he couldn't live alone, we moved him to the memory care floor. Set the room up the same. Not sure he ever realized it wasn't the same room.
I wish I had something to offer, we also looked at both options and there did not seem to be any clear criteria for ""triggering"" when someone needed more intensive care. Obviously at some point you know, but when they are right there on the edge, and you're not sure they really need that level yet it's hard to know. One place we talked to said they would do an evaluation which meant my mom having to stay there for a few days, then they would tell us what they felt she needed.... But honestly, I didn't trust them to say anything other than the most expensive option was needed, then we found out more info that led us to believe we couldn't even afford the assisted living option at that place.

No help at all I know. Just wanted to say you're not alone. Best if luck, I hope you find someone who can help.
We originally had hoped to put my dad in assisted living first and then move him to Memory Care. Ultimately we decided on Memory Care. He tends to wake up really early, and we thought in Memory Care, if he wakes up early, he can always go to the nurse’s station. And while he’s not a wanderer, he certainly could have decided to go on a walk and then get lost. He basically had very poor executive function, so while he could have lived in AL on his best day, we knew he could not live there on his worst day. We also thought it would be best for him to get used to Memory Care before he gets really bad, rather than moving him there once he’s already bad. 

Looking back, we made the right decision (for us). I’m in a support group for ALZ caretakers, and I was surprised at the number of people who had loved ones with dementia or Alzheimer’s that were living alone in AL, and their family members were having to convince them to move to MC, and they were all highly resistant to it. I’m very glad we already moved dad into his “apartment with help” so we didn’t have to convince him (and we would have needed to move him very quickly).
At the end of the month, my brother and I are flying to help my mom move dad into memory care. We have been guiding mom through the process and pushing her a little, because she is not young, either, and it has been very difficult for her to be a caregiver. But now that there are just a few weeks yet that dad will live at home, she is second-guessing the decision.

He scores very low on the MOCA tests now (essentially has the capabilities of a pre-schooler now.) He still tries to be helpful, but can't work simple household items (a remote, a garage door opener), is starting to not know what to do when he has to go to the bathroom (he does a ""potty dance,"" and mom has to show him where the bathroom is. Several times now, he has tried to ""go"" into something that is not a toilet.) If she gets on the phone, he tries to leave the house (and has gotten pretty sneaky about it.) Essentially, it is as if she is taking care of a 4-year-old, except he is adult-sized, and she is 75 and a little frail. He is still very happy and sweet, but no longer can identify his loved ones. He could never manage his own medications, and now that he is starting to have toileting problems, it really is time for him to go to full-time care. I think the toileting issues, along with his desire to leave the house several times a day (he sometimes says he needs to go home, or needs to find his wife and kids, or his mother), have been big factors in making the move to memory care.

When mom says she feels guilty about moving him out, I remind her that it is not a good plan to wait until there is an emergency to make the move (because she may not be able to find a bed on short notice), and that moving him before he is too far gone will make the transition easier for him. She has picked out a facility that is only a five minute drive from their house, and she plans on frequent visits and even wants to still do some of his laundry. I expect we will see a big slip in abilities once he is in care (they are starting to pull him off of some of his medications.) I think there are only 35 patients in the unit, and there are a good number of staff, but his doctors have told us to expect a decline.

It has been our experience that mom doesn't see how bad dad's condition has become, because she lives with it every day. If he fell (and that is coming, I'm sure), she would not be able to help him up (or, he could fall and hurt himself by knocking his head on furniture or something.) He will start needing to use an adult diaper likely very soon, and that is not something mom can handle physically (and she would really struggle with that as a task, just mentally/emotionally). Everyone who knows them says it is time -- relatives, doctors, friends. A united front has meant she has now accepted this as the right time. But it is not easy.
We had no choice. My mom was in assisted living for a month, and I got a call she'd escaped, despite a door alarm, and was found wandering down the road. A week later, she escaped again, and no one knows how long she was outside in just her slippers, yoga pants, and long-sleeved t-shirt on a 20 F degree morning. She was evaluated and her body temperature was a little low, not dangerously thankfully, but the assisted living at that point said they wanted her out of their community ASAP.

Look around. Despite what the manager at the assisted living place said, we found a memory care community that was brand new and they offered us a special deal that made the price we were paying the same as what they charged us. Each year, we renegotiated, and in the end, they never raised the rate. We wish they'd been Medicaid so that we could have kept her in there.
My mom’s behavior was the trigger. She was getting increasingly aggressive and unpredictable with the staff. The assisted living facility was also unwilling/unable to manage her prescription medication needs.",2021-08-09 11:57:01,3Gilligans,p149z2
Alzheimers,Big Rick and his elephants,"“He’s had another accident” my mum said when I waked in.
“I left his pile cream and toothpaste together in the bathroom.”
“Fuckin hell mum, which one did he use?”
“I dunno but he’s either got a minty arse or tight gums I’ve not found out yet”
My Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2014. We think he’d had it longer. Hes 75 now, an ex semi professional footballer in his younger years, and as it has been well covered on the news recently, it is now very common to see this generation of ex players suffering from it after years of heading heavy mud soaked footballs in the 60’s and 70’s. 

Throughout my time growing up in wythenshawe, everyone knew Big Rick. Wherever we went when I was introduced to anyone he used to play with they would eulogise about how great a player he was. I used to find it annoying as a spotty faced centre forward trying to be my own man and living in his shadow in the Manchester amateur football scene, but looking back it was something I should have enjoyed. 

He was larger than life in my teenage years. Passionate about sport. Loved his horse racing, golf and snooker. Terrible gambler. Would bet on two flies on a wall. Some of my earliest memories is being on holiday where we were dragged into a smokey room upstairs in pontins in Prestatyn whilst he played brag. He would sit laughing and swearing at everyone with a massive cigar on the go. 

That’s what makes it so difficult now. It’s never easy for anyone altzimers. It’s a bastard of a disease. The long goodbye as it’s commonly known. It’s a gradual thing. Human beings only remember in the short term, and the longer it goes on, you remember the person they are now rather than then. With my dad the most painful thing was watching the confidence disappear. He was such an alpha male. To see him turn nervous and apologetic was heartbreaking. 

I was going through some old VHS tapes recently and found him doing a speech at a sportsman’s evening from the mid eighties. I felt a lump in my throat straight away. There he was, full of life and passion, delivering a wonderful speech to a room of hundreds of people. I called him in and he sat down. “Watch this” I said and as he walked on stage his old smile beamed across his face. “Look at that” he said. He watched the whole thing in silence and it was like we’d stepped into a time machine together. It was wonderful. At the end he turned to me and I looked at him holding back the tears and he said “who was that again?”. I just burst out laughing. 

Recently he has got worse and the stories have become more ridiculous. He was always telling you which football league grounds he had played at when you were watching the games, but he tried to tell me he’d played at the Allianz arena last week. “Have you fuck” I told him, then felt really snide. He also recanted a wonderful tale to me recently of how his dad had been kidnapped by Germans during World War Two but the tootengam hotspur team had rescued him and his dad had took him to spurs as guest of honour when he was young and they were paraded round the pitch. Another one in the car was when we were driving through Bramhall and he said “when I was a kid there were no cars round here.......just elephants with men riding them”. 

I had to spend a weekend looking after him recently when my mum was away and it is only when you spend an extended period of time with him that you see the disease in it’s entirety. It comes down like a cloud. Sometimes, it’s like he hasn’t even got it, then other times it’s like he is completely not there. On the Saturday night we watched match of the day together then I give him his tablets and put him in bed and just as I tucked him in he looked at me with an expression of complete clarity like he was 20 years younger and said “thanks for doing all this for me son”. I give him a kiss and went in the next room, lay down in the dark and cried like I hadn’t for years. 

I’m not complaining, he’s 75 and still here. Some of my mates lost their dad very early and I realise how lucky I’ve been. But in all honesty and as hard as this is to say out loud, when he does go it will be a relief. It’s hard enough now, seeing him in the middle stages. I just hope he goes before it gets worse. If I got the call in the middle of the night that he had gone in his sleep, I would grieve for my dad, but a part of me would rejoice. I would celebrate that I won’t have to watch any more of it. To see him deteriorate to the point where he doesn’t remember you any more, that’s got to be the worst. I hope he goes before then, on his own terms, riding the big elephant to the sky, detouring through bramhall first, of course.","My mom was so vital, and she always wanted to retire back in her home country, England. That my dad died before that happened breaks my heart. I looked into it, but UK attorneys said without one of us also moving to the UK for two years to care for her, they wouldn't allow her back in.

She's a little older than your dad and is now in a wheelchair and barely makes any sense when she tries to talk. She's losing weight as she isn't eating as much as she used to. She recognized my brother, though she messed up his name, but she seemed to have no clue who I was. She just stared blankly at me. 

I second your ""it will be a relief."" I keep hoping that the late-night calls I do get will be the ""she passed in her sleep.""
Your first sentences made me laugh but then the rest of your post made me cry.  Alzheimer’s is such a cruel disease that ravages not only the sufferer, but the family as well.  I think we mourn our loved one a little at a time as the disease steals away the person we knew.  When my dad died it was a relief that he was no longer suffering.  I am so sorry you are going through this.  Sending you wishes for comfort and peace.",2021-08-09 03:14:21,VerdeNo1,p0weqk
Alzheimers,How to ask somebody to get help?,"My grandpa has talked to me twice now on my grandma’s memory. She’s 75 years old. He first mentioned it to me last winter, but said it may just be her getting a bit older. I had noticed she seemed to be writing things down more, both on a notepad in her purse, and on a calendar she keeps by her armchair. She had also started asking me to remind her more often when I had appointments and such that she wanted to come up for.

This past weekend, he mentioned it again, but explained that things are getting worse. She’ll go pull out the sweeper, sweep, put the sweeper up, then a little bit later go pull out the sweeper again, and then just leave it  laying out. She’s forgetting conversations more often, to the point where my Great Uncle even mentioned it to my grandpa. My great uncle’s wife had Alzheimer’s, and he told my grandpa that my grandma reminds him of his wife before her diagnosis. Another odd behavior my grandpa mentioned was that she’s started to screw bottle caps on wrong. He showed me that this morning, she left a bottle of orange juice on the counter, and the cap was on it crooked. Though, full transparency I’m not for sure how/if that’s a sign of Alzheimer’s, I didn’t see it while I was searching around. 

All of this aside, another thing we talked about was how/if we should mention this to her. I love my grandma dearly, she’s been almost a mother to me, but I know she can be stubborn and doesn’t take perceived criticism well. 

What’s the best way to go about bringing the potential for this to her attention? I don’t want to hurt her emotionally, but I’m so scared that if this goes un-checked by the time she get’s help it’ll be too late","If she's writing things down more on a notepad and calendar, chances are that she knows her memory's getting worse. The best thing you can do is talk to her about it and ask her if she can get checked out by a doctor. Reassure her by saying it's probably nothing but you just want to be sure because you love her and care about her. Don't frame it like she's doing anything wrong, because that might make her defensive and she may refuse to see the doctor.

To clear up a common misconception - memory loss is not just a normal part of ageing. If she's getting more forgetful, there's a reason for it. It might be something as simple as a side effect of some medication that she may currently be taking but it might also be a sign of something more. The only way you'll know is by getting her checked out by a doctor.",2021-08-08 23:43:31,hedgemk,p0tloe
Alzheimers,Should I visit my Grandma when seeing her is painful,"Hello, i've posted before a couple times and figured I would post again.  


The last two times, pre pandamic, I tried to visit my Grandma and did, however both times she did not recall who I was. We were always very close so this was extremely hard for me, but I put on a brave face and she did tell me I was ""Quite a nice young man"" at the end of the visit.  


Fast forward to 2021, last year she had a fall and broke her hip, she'd now in a wheelchair, and i've been internally conflicted if I should still go and see her next time I get a chance, or stop visiting. I always feel a bit awkward visiting her (I'm on the autism spectrum) but I've tried my best the last few times. I posted this because internally I am conflicted on seeing her how she is now, or just remembering how she was at least before the fall.   


Thanks in advance for any answers.","I can tell you an ugly truth that people in facilities that have families visit them tend to get more care from the facility staff.  She can't tell anyone if something is going wrong and people like her can slip through the cracks if they don't have family checking in on her.  

For example, you come in to see her and she is cold, you can see her shivering and no one has noticed yet because the staff are all busy.  You get her a sweater and a lap blanket and she spends the rest of the day cozy.  

Try visiting her with the idea in mind that you can go and see if she needs anything, you can bring her a treat, sit with her to make sure she eats, be someone that has time to sit and hold her hand and give her a smile.   You are one of the few people in the world that truly have her best interests at heart and that is important for her even if she can't recognize you any more.
When my grandmother was first admitted to a care home, I went weekly. This didn’t last long.

She grew worst and worst and I came less and less. Maybe once a month at most.

For a long time I felt horrible after. Every time I would go I would try to stay for a while but ended up leaving after 15 minutes.

After that I moved abroad, so obviously rarely go. However I spoke a lot about this in therapy and came to some sort of happiness when seeing her. Instead of focusing on how far gone she was, couldn’t communicate or understand me, I focused on little things that would bring joy. When I went, I would play some old music with my phone, hold her hand, and just talk to her about my week, how things are going etc. 
When she would get angry or excited, I would simply try to calm her down, speaking about something else or sitting in silence.

Since lockdown I’ve not seen her as I cannot travel internationally. It breaks my heart when I think about it, and would love nothing more than to see her again. I send videos from time to time that the care home show her. She smiles every time apparently.

There is nothing you can do about her condition. Feeling horrible after seeing a loved one with that condition is normal, I cried many times and had a small breakdown after leaving.

The best we can do is small things to bring them joy, try to focus on that rather than the condition and the effects it has on you. Take the opportunity to say things you mean and want to be heard before communication leave. My biggest regret is not telling her I love her enough just to hear her response, which I never will anymore.

I probably went on a tangent, but I hope this experience helps you in some way. All the best.
I've visited my grandma twice a week since January. We have always been close. Sometimes she remembers who I am, and sometimes she doesn't. Over the last year she's definitely gone downhill, and isn't even a fraction of the person I remember and knew. That said, I try to remind myself that she deserves the most love care and patience, not bc of where she's at now, but bc of who she was.  She's helped me a lot throughout the years, and so many others. I know her true self would be so embarrassed with some of the ways she's acted as this disease has taken over. So when things get hard I try to remind myself who I'm really there for.
Do what you feel is right for you. Think about how you'll feel after she passes. I go to visit my dad now even though we can't communicate so I feel better. I bring a dog and/or my sister so there's a distraction. I play games on my phone. But I feel as if I need to go. He doesn't speak much. He doesn't interact. Sometimes I rub his arm. Don't feel bad if you don't want to go but think how you'll feel down the road. Good luck
When you were little, your Grandma gave to you.  Now that she is a child again herself, you should give to her, without selfishness or expectation of reward.  She thought you were a nice young man, that tells me she did appreciate your visit.  Perhaps as an icebreaker, you could bring her a potted plant or a small box of candy.  (Ask your parents for advice - some gifts might not be appropriate.)

When you visit, you can ask her questions about her family when she was growing up, or whether she watched any of the OIympics, or any other topic that seems to appeal to her.  As her dementia progresses, speech will be harder for her, so take your cue from her.

Thank you for asking.  I hope you do visit her.
Do your best to visit her. It is for her own good to have someone that cares. Even if she doesn't know you anymore a kind word and love can help. Humans need social interaction on an intrinsic level.  Staff at homes are busy and cannot provide much interaction for all their residents.
What about going for a short visit, say 15-20 minutes?  That way you have contact with her but with an emphasis on the quality of time you spend with her rather than the quantity.   I know it isn’t easy seeing her in her current condition, but a short visit might be easier.
I know it's hard visiting. My brother is declining and it's depressing to see him grow more and more incognizant, and now he's even physically shrinking away. It's awkward to try to talk with him when I visit because he can't follow the thread of a conversation and he can't form responsive sentences anymore, he can only say small talk from habit. I didn't know how to interact with him. 

But my SIL discovered the magic of Krispy Kreme donuts. Sometimes sweet treats, if allowed, can brighten a mood. It's worth a try. Bring donuts or Oreos or some other special treat that brings her joy. Also, organize an album of photos on your phone to share with her, some old ones and some recent ones. You can show them to her and talk about them without her having to say much. The advantage of bringing donuts or a treat is that you only need to stay long enough for her to eat it and to make a bit of small talk, then say something like, ""Well, I wanted to bring you these donuts but I need to go now to run some errands. I'll come back soon.""
Thank you everyone for the replies. I forgot to mention she's 800 miles away and closer to my parents, so I can't just pop in. I discussed things a bit with my Mom today and am thinking about visiting her at Christmas while I'm down there.",2021-08-07 23:19:24,ResponsibleNerve,p076x3
Alzheimers,I just found out my dad has alzheimers,"Please can somebody help me? I have so many questions. 
He isn't too far gone yet, but I can see he isn't himself anymore when I'm visiting.
Like, can I help in anyway even though I can't live with my parents?
What should I think about when I talk with him? 
How fast does it take ahold?
Can I help my mom in anyway that live with him and have a hard time handling/dealing with this?

PM me or write in the comments","You can help without living with your dad. 

Be support 'staff'. Grocery shop. Help with house work. Sit with Dad so Mom can visit hairdresser, or shop. Bring food. Help on trips to the doctor with dad.
Outside of legal and medical advice, this is the best advice I got: Don't try to make him remember things or correct him when he misremembers. My dad thinks he's 81, he's actually several years older. Let him be 81. My cousin went with me to visit, he didn't remember her. That's OK, it's been a long time since he saw her. He asks if I'm going to stay for lunch 5 times in the course of 40 minutes. Each time I give the same answer, I'd love to but can't today. Never ""you just asked me that"" and never ""don't you remember?"" The glue that holds his memories together is dissolving, you can try to arrange the pieces for him but they won't stick. And the look he gets sometimes when he realizes that is freaking heartbreaking.
First thing... do not panic.It's going to be hard, but you can get through this like many others have.

First question:

*How is your mother's functionality?*

(No matter what this disease will exceed her capacity)

The first thing I tell people is to get power of attorney settled and all the financials arranged.  
 [This short video list from the links below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lFYKAVQYLE) will help.  
 I can't stress this enough that they need to be protected from themselves and those that will steal from them.  ALSO, Know their wishes in all these difficult matters while they can express them.  That includes end of life care and wishes.  
Gotta get that done now so it's clear and you're not burdened with trying to ""best guess"" in the moment.

Before you may realize it, it'll be too late for them to detail these things if they're already forgetting your name. (that was 2017 for me) Thankfully you have your mother and that will make things immensely easier for everyone.  *A good way to handle this is that she can take the lead in relating her wishes legally  in front of your father and he can follow suit because chances are very good that he's already patterning his behavior and fading faculties on what he sees her doing - it's a crutch to help them function as they rely on others*

• Do all of this in conjunction with your mother.

Then start accessing all the area's group services that you might have.This can also be done online.   \[Here's some webinars for my local AZ Group\]([https://www.alzsd.org/services/education/](https://www.alzsd.org/services/education/))  They have a Dementia 101 video, communications and other useful videos online from past webinars - strongly suggested you watch those.

The support groups can be helpful as you'll have more experienced people [(again a local listing that all are meeting online due to COVID - we have people from all over so it's not regional in any way)](https://www.alzsd.org/services/support-groups/)  YMMV, you have to find the right group for you but at least you'll see and hear people that have already been through what you're describing.

Fact: You'll have to make adjustments in your life to help your mother.  
This will take the form of shopping and support, it's going to be rough on her.  
\*\*She's going to need people to talk too as well as yourself. \*\*

Help initially by doing the things they have trouble with and I STRONGLY suggest you get into contact with a lawyer (with your mom) so that you can make plans. (above)  This might take the form of having all his worth signed over to you / your mother so that he appears poor on paper and qualifies for Medicaid. (SUPER IMPORTANT) that way you or your mother will perhaps able to access additional services and or get money for caring for him.  (USA Only - sorry if this doesn't apply to you)

I've found the entire old age home, assisted living and ""memory care"" industry to be dominated by a national corporation who's business model is to drain all the finances from the victim until they're broke and qualify for Medicaid.   That will leave nothing for your mother.  So get all of that protected and done like ""now"".   Once they get into that system it's near to impossible to get them out. (ymmv)

I don't know if there's an official diagnosis but if there is no medical record, then...  \*\*get insurance for him!\*\*  Something that will offer full coverage that'll include this condition's treatment and care. It's well worth it.

There's a lot to do and prep for.

You will discover what his individual ""flavor"" or this condition is as it's takes further shape.   I suggest you play some music for him from his teen years or what he liked to listen too 15 years ago.  Long term memories are easier to access than new ones. That will help bring him in and ""present"".

I'm a personal fan of vitamins, diet, nutrition and some supplements. These make a big difference with my father and PM me if you want some suggestions to run past your fathers doctor.

**Make sure they're correctly medicated.**

**You'll have to be your parents advocate, it'll be best for them and for you later on to have them getting good care.**

Finding good doctors and getting his needs met are something you can focus on for both of them.    Remember that while the focus is often on your dad, *your mother will need help too, you're all in this together and you'll all be affected.*

IF they can't remember who you are, then you're on your way. The first signs of decline might have started a few years ago... so you've got to catch up to their current needs.  It's a gradual and progressive disease, medication will help.  Nutrition is important as is keeping them active and stimulated.

There will be behavioral changes and my father became a paranoid monster for awhile.  That will not necessarily be your experience but it's something that's also  treatable.   You're going to have to good with the changes and remembering that it's not their fault. A positive attitude will safe you and your mother a LOT of heartache. Remember to step back and breathe.. then laugh at the situation. It's going to be challenging but there will be absurd times.

*Just remember to laugh when it happens*

It IS going to be hard.

Things will change because they must.

Don't leave your mom alone to try to deal with this (it killed mine via the stress)  One aspect of this disease is that parents try to keep it a secret and don't tell others, they withdraw from friends and family and you only found out when the house of cards fell apart.

The bottom line is that you can handle this, just take it step by step and there's plenty of help you can get along the way.  I Strongly suggest you watch the above links and seek out local groups and agencies to give assistance.Better to have it all set up early.

Also last thing.  
The memory care facilities that I've all visited all shorten their lives.  Being at home with family extends and enriches their life according to all the studies, it also saves money and you can still share good times with them.   I have my father at home with me and while difficult, it's been rewarding, I just told him I was writing this to you and he understood. He's ""there"" and present although the more recent events of the last 5 years age a bit difficult for him to remember.

His finances (trust) allows for me to care for him and I've adjusted my life to make it possible as it's a commitment.

Not everyone will be that fortunate.
Keep an eye on your mom's mental health and level of burnout. As the spouse, she might find it difficult to admit when she can't do it by herself anymore. Let her know it's okay to need help.
Alzheimer’s can affect people and progress very differently depending on circumstances. You’ll be able to find lots of suggestions for activities you can do with him at different stages, but my advice would be spend time with him when you can, look at old pictures together, ask questions about his life and talk about whatever you may eventually regret not being able to talk about. As he begins to need more care, you can help your mom by locating and coordinating available services and staying with your dad to give her some breaks when you can. On a practical note, you can also help them get certain affairs in order that will be much easier to take care of while he is still able to make decisions and sign legal documents.
Saw grandma mentally disintegrate, she passed from it a few years ago and it was extremely difficult, and I’ll always regret how I lacked compassion because it would just get so tiring and frustrating.  She would get into a state where she was living out the past, and she didn’t recognize me and thought I was someone else.  She’s wake up not sure where she was and stand at the door all night and hold the knob in fear.  Very heartbreaking, the times when she became lucid and smiled and remembered me.  I still grieve for her suffering.

Only advice I can give, is whatever happens it’ll still be the same person.  If I could go back I’d be a lot more patient than I was…

I found that playing my dad's favorite music brought him around a bit... His favorite old movies... Things he doesn't think about to enjoy. It just kind of booted him up a bit. Best of luck to you.",2021-08-07 10:53:19,Tittut1,ozuou3
Alzheimers,A little morbid but - how long before death?,"Throwaway bc family and friends know my reddit acc.

My step-father is in his mid fifties, diagnosed with AD three years ago with clear symptoms at least five years ago. In his family, his father had it, his grandmother had it, and his great-grandmother had it as well as certain members of his extended family. It's a prevalent disease due to, I imagine, inbreeding. His family comes from a small village in my country and according to his mother, his father and her were relatively close cousins.

He has been more of a father to me than my actual father in so many ways, a really brilliant mathematician who used to love doing sudoku puzzles and now he can't even write the first letter of his name, let alone a word or a calculation.

Currently, he still remembers all of us, however his short-term memory is non-existant. He is irritable when my mother isn't around and always wants to go outside though thankfully he can't find the door. He constantly needs to be kept active, which is something that my mother did not marry him for - he used to live slowly, lounging on the couch and reading etc. The most recent antics of his are being unable to pee into the actual toilet. This, while disgusting, is even more problematic due to the fact that he was diagnosed with a Hep B chronic infection, which was caused by a blood transfusion from a surgery a few years ago. My mother is primarily worried about me developing an infection, even though I was the generation that was vaccinated against it.

How long does he have before death? That is the only thing that we can hope for. Hospice care is far, far too expensive - especially for patients who are able to walk. Nurses as well, we don't have that kind of money. Our country doesn't really have a good safety net for Alzheimers patients. I love him, I really do - but I don't want my image of him to deteriorate further.","I'm a hospice nurse in the USA. Curiosity or needing information about his prognosis (how much time he has left) is not morbid.  Understanding the chronic disease process and what his end of life will be like is important.  When you understand what is happening it takes away the fear of the unknown and makes helping him easier.

A little practical knowledge first, if he is peeing in unusual places there are garments that you can buy or make that close in back or have a zipper all the way up the front that makes it harder for him to do that.

If you are vaccinated against hep B and your mom is worried, there is a blood test that can check to make sure that you have antibodies against the virus.  Has the doctor mentioned any reason that the risk would be higher that normal?

Finally, there are many factors involved that are taken into account when estimating how much time a person has left.  How much is the HeP B affecting him, for example.  Does he have jaundice or ascites(swollen belly)?  Is he eating and drinking well or losing weight?  Does he have other diagnosis could be contributing to his decline?  When the liver isn't working well it can cause a build up of waste products that are usually eliminated in the stool. Those waste products affect the brain and can make dementia symptoms worse as well as shorten his life span further.

Many dementia patients die due to injuries from falls or infections, sometimes the part of the brain that controls swallowing is affected and this causes a respiratory infection because food or fluid is going into the lungs.  These are just examples of how decline happens and not meant to apply to your family member.

For your research you might look up some things such as:  hepatic encephalopathy,(how liver disease can change the brain) dysphagia(swallowing problems), FAST scale, palliative performance scale, (how to measure decline) signs and symptoms of impending death, fall safety in the home for dementia patients, skin changes in liver disease.  I hope this helps you understand more about what is happening and what to expect in the future and help you communicate with your health care team.  I know these are medical terms that might seem a little intimidating, please don't let that deter you too much from learning about what is happening to your dad.",2021-08-07 07:51:39,FatherWithAlzheimers,ozrv57
Alzheimers,"Grandma won’t stop asking the same questions, what should we do?","My grandma has been staying with us for over a week because my grandpa is in the hospital. She is nearing the end of the moderate stage. She is at the point where she doesn’t know who anybody is. She sometimes thinks her husband (my grandpa) is her dad,  thinks my mom is her sister. It’s endless. She just won’t stop asking questions, some of them don’t even make sense. I feel bad for getting annoyed but it’s so tiring listening to her ask my mom all these questions when my mom keeps giving her the same answers. She has a tablet that she likes to play solitaire on which helps distract her but even that sometimes won’t work. I know this is very vague but there is too much to put on here. What should we do that would maybe help with all the questions/distract her?","Try putting on some music she likes.  That often can break a repetitive train of thought.

But this behavior of hers is typical.  Just keep answering the questions.  You can also try redirecting.  Offer to give her a cookie and milk, or play cards with you, or brush her hair.
My motto when caring for my brother has been, ""Divert, distract, and redirect whenever possible,""  just as a gentle parent would do with a toddler who's being irrational.

 [Teepa Snow's videos](https://teepasnow.com/resources/about-dementia/) are really helpful to learn ways to communicate with Alzheimer's patients. She's an expert in caring for dementia patients and models interactions, which is more helpful than reading about them, imho. 

Don't be afraid of the ""weirdness."" Your grandma will repeat herself and ask or say things that make no sense. It's part of the cognitive decline -- she isn't able to hold onto thoughts about incoming information, and eventually she won't be able to form complete thoughts at all. Following conversations may be impossible for her at times, as well. 

Find the humor whenever you can, and allow your grandma to be different than she used to be, while remembering her at her best! When she doesn't make sense, or when she insists that something is different than reality, simply play along and don't try to reason with her or argue.  Let her repeat actions over and over if that's what floats her boat. My brother liked to take clothes off hangers and drape them on furniture, admiring them, folding them, and showing us the colors & buttons over and over again, demanding our attention, pointing. ""Look! Look!"" like a child. It was annoying after so many repetitions, but we learned to say, ""Wow, I see."" or ""Which jacket should I try on?"" to appease him. My saintly SIL patiently hung up clothes behind him so he could do it all over again.

It helps to remember that your reality is not her reality anymore. She grabs onto pieces of our reality but can't remember them well enough to interpret how the pieces fit together in a linear, logical order like we can. When someone reminds us about something or corrects us, we say, ""Oh, yes, that's right!"" but your grandma can't recognize her mistake. It's like she's hearing that  information for the first time, each time. It's OK -- let her be where she is cognitively, and accept her. You won't succeed at making her see the truth, and it's probably upsetting when you correct her, argue with her, or remind her that she's repeating herself (upsetting to both you and her).

Divert her attention and distract her. For example, if she says she wants to see Billy (an old boyfriend from younger days), simply say, ""We'll see him soon,"" or ""Let's call him later,"" or whatever, NOT, ""You haven't seen Billy in 50 years! You're married to Grandpa, remember?""

Instead of saying, ""But you live with us now. You can't go back to your old house."" just say, ""We'll see about going there tomorrow. Let's go get some ice cream now."" Avoid correcting or arguing as much as you can, because she won't remember the facts later and repeating them in an impatient tone may upset her. 

Sometimes it's calmer and easier to tell ""white lies"" or change the subject. Compassionate dishonesty is forgivable as a calming device with dementia, because the truth is not always understandable and is often upsetting.
Just try to remember it is the disease and not the person. Also think how terrifying it would be to not know who the people around you are or where you are at, asking questions to try and make sense of of the nightmare you find yourself in, and then not being able to remember the answers.
Thanks for the suggestions. I will try some of them, I guess this post was somewhat venting. I understand it’s not her fault. It’s just hard and scary. It makes me think about my moms future, along with my own. It truly sucks. My mom is hopefully getting her into adult day care sometime next week, to give my grandpa a break when he comes home and for his health to not get worse (caregiver stress and just general genetics) this is my first time posting on the subreddit, but I’ve been reading some the past couple weeks. I hope I don’t sound like I’m blaming my grandma, it’s not her fault. I know somebody said to try to remember her for who she used to be and not what she is now, but it is really hard. I miss my grandma from before the Alzheimer’s. She was such a great person to be around. Sometimes she still is there a little bit but to her I’m not her grand daughter anymore, just a friendly young person. When people say to treasure the memories you have with your grandparents, I now get what they mean.",2021-08-06 20:31:14,Hairy_Cow_8373,ozj590
Alzheimers,My Grandma thinks Im “handsome”,I hadn’t seen my grandma since last mothers day. All she could talk about last visit was how pretty I am. I had pink hair that was a bit longer than it was now last time. Im afab trans masculine and last time she asked me a few times if I was a man or a woman. She doesn’t usually remember who I am but it doesn’t hurt my feelings. I have shorter hair now and this time I visited her she gendered me correctly half the time. She doesn’t know Im trans and my family misgenders me most of the time (though its not a big enough issue for me to pick a fight about). It was interesting to see how her perception of me changed depending on the conversation since she forgets things so easily. Im not sure it means much as far as how well I “pass” given her condition but instead of calling me beautiful this time she called me handsome more often than not. She actually flirted with me a bit which I found funny and flattering. I don’t think she’d retained that Im her grandkid. Maybe Im weird for not being weirded out by this and taking it in stride. She was being pretty innocent so it wasn’t a bid deal for me but I realize this could be a sensitive subject so Im sorry if it is for those who read this. I was genuinely curious if this was a common behavior for people with Alzheimer’s? Like is it common for people to hit on their family members in this way or is my Grandma just an oddball?,"I have watched love ones try to make dates with sons -maybe seeing their father in them - and sons-in-laws.  And older men assume their daughters were their wives or girlfriends.  All this to say, I think that flirty is pretty common because they, in that moment may be seeing the world as it once was and trying to make everything fit their reality.  So, I don't think it is weird, I think it is sweet and a compliment. Take it as such, and enjoy time with someone who obviously thinks your handsome and enjoys time with you.
It's very common for people with Alzheimer's to forget their family members' identities, and calling them someone else.  A mother may think her own daughter is her own mother.  

I respect that you are being okay with her misgendering you.  All this trans stuff is incredibly novel to her generation and hard to understand, and that's even if a person doesn't have dementia.
I think my dad mistook me for someone he was dating a couple times, as he was actually straight up inappropriate with me. So yes it does happen, but just be aware that if you get uncomfortable with it, its ok to put some space between you. 

Other than that it sounds pretty cool she finds you to be an attractive human being in any case. :)
I imagine it is common or at the least it is not unusual. Dementia patients’ brains are changing so much, they have a lot of difficulty remembering who everyone is. They still like to flirt, kiss, hold hands. Years ago my mother said to my brother as she was giving him an extra tight squeeze of a hug, that he was a very handsome husband. She’s also held my husband’s hand walking down the street, no big deal.
My SO with Alzheimer's is at the point that her short term memory is 'wacked'. She mid-remembers me as other people, asks if that person is still here. Or where will they sleep?",2021-08-06 20:37:43,CharlieDair,ozj8wl
Alzheimers,"People taking care of someone with Alzheimer's, what legal and financial steps do you wish had been taken care of before the diagnosis? (particularly in the US)","Alzheimer's runs in my wife's family, particularly in the women. She's approaching the age where her grandmother, mother, and two older sisters were diagnosed. We want to make sure that there aren't complications that I or, if something were to happen to me, her daughters would have to navigate.  


I'm reaching out to an elder law attorney this coming week and would like to have some idea about what questions to ask. Thank you!","-Durable power of attorney for financial and medical decisions 
-Advanced directives/DNR
-Last Will & Testament
-Add POA and beneficiaries on financial accounts to transfer on death instead of going through probate when administrating a will 
-Long term care insurance 
-Depending on the financial situation and family dynamic, you should look into whether it would be advantageous to gift her children some of their inheritance annually or put it in some type of trust.
Get, or make sure you know where to get, all of their important paperwork. Read through it, replace anything that’s missing. 

My dad died with no Will- we were constantly trying to get him to make one, but he refused to even talk about it. My mom’s Alzheimer’s got worse right as he died, and it wasn’t until we dug through all his files that we found out they were never legally married. 

This complicated everything, and of course my mom couldn’t really answer any relevant questions at that point. We also found his pension paperwork, which he filled out so the pension would end when he died- since she wasn’t legally his wife, she wouldn’t have been entitled anyway, but if we had seen all these things earlier by checking all the paperwork, things could have been much different now.
Obviously get financial and medical POA so that you can make decisions on the sick relative's behalf (not the same as overriding her will, that would be guardianship and it's more extreme).

Get her assets such as the house she plans to leave to her children and her savings into a trust so that her children can inherit before the clawback period. 

Get long term care insurance so that you can private pay in a facility for a couple years before switching onto Medicaid.

https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/
I agree with the ""wish I'd sat down and known..."" Some of my wishes are things that won't apply here, but as background, my dad was my mom's main caregiver, and he kept a lot hidden from his family. He died unexpectedly and while they had a will and powers of attorney in place, none of us were prepared for what we found. He'd cashed in the life insurance policies, put the home under a reverse mortgage, and he hadn't taken her to a doctor in almost two years. The story is he told doctors he couldn't get her to get into the car and go, and it was too hard. Meanwhile, he told us that she was doing great and that he was also in great health.

I got all of that caught up, but we had the reverse mortgage taking up almost all of her income. He was afraid to sell the house without having renovated it fully, but the renovations and debt pay off ate up a lot of the lump sum he'd gotten from the reverse mortgage. We all work and are too young to retire, and the cost of home care for her was too expensive without getting out from under the reverse mortgage. Equity that was left paid for a few years of care for my mom, but Medicaid became necessary. That's when we learned one sibling had gotten ""loans"" that were never repaid, so that messed up the 5-year look-back period, too.

We wish we'd sat down with my dad each month and gone over bills, expenses, etc. Getting blindsided was a little rough.

We wish we'd pushed harder to get them to downsize years ago. Their goal was to always retire in my mom's home country, but his fear of selling the house without having it in like-new condition kept them from doing that. Had they done so, my mom's home country has national health. All of the bills we've helped cover for her prescriptions and medical care would have been paid if they'd moved back to Europe. It's maddening know the thousands we've paid would have been covered elsewhere. If I could go back, I would be pushing to get them to move right after retirement, and not drag on the ""but I need to do this first...""
Everyone has listed pretty much everything I wish I had done legally and financially but I do have one thing to add. If you own a house, I highly suggest you make sure the house is in both of your names. It makes negotiating with mortgage companies easier. As well, if she is put into a memory care facility and you cannot 100% afford it, it will prevent the house from going into probate.
Trust, poa or will made and signed 5years before diagnosis. Once they are deemed incompetent it’s game over unless you get an emergency conservatorship or emergency guardianship. 

Good luck. ❤️

Alzheimers,Help. PLEASE.,"At 62, My mom is showing some clear onset signs of Alzheimers in poor money management and lack of self care. She wont save money, or set money aside for rent. She wont bathe often, nor will she visit a doctor, even though she is appearing malnourished. She's not terribly forgetful, but she will often gaslight me in very important situations saying she told me key information, but it was never said. It's a very dramatic behavior and I'm struggling to cope with this. I have no guidance on how to handle this situation, so I'm turning to reddit to help me find resources to help her. I heard often the only thing to do is wait until she becomes an endangerment to me, before committing her to help- but I know there HAS to be something I can do. She is intelligent enough where I believe with treatment, she can retain her faculties. But I am scared, I am terrified, that if this festers, I will lose her or my lose my freedom trying to help her (I am only 26 years old). Alzheimers runs through my family so I know I'm not imagining things. PLEASE HELP.","Are you in the US? The first step anywhere would be reaching out to elderly and aging nonprofits near you - they will have a lot of resources and were very helpful in walking us through what we needed to do. 

She also will need to see a doctor in order to get a diagnosis
At [alz.org](https://alz.org), there's a 24/7 helpline listed you can call to talk to someone for advice. Also, on that site, under local resources you can see what services and groups are in your area. 

Have you talked to her about seeing a doctor? She might be eligible for cholinesterase inhibitors, which help with alertness, memory and judgment for those suffering mild symptoms of dementia or Alzheimer's. 

Right now, one of the biggest studies being funded by Alzheimer's groups is U.S. POINTER, which is exploring strong findings from a Finnish study that concluded lifestyle changes can make a significant difference for early stages. This study found that a combination of physical exercise, a healthy diet and cognitive stimulation (like auditing local college courses, learning a new language, high-level reading material and frequent social engagement) can be very beneficial to those living with Alzheimer's. Any (and ideally all) of these should be implemented soon so they can have an effect more quickly.

Just as important is your mental health. Being scared and terrified is completely normal, but as this continues it can take a major toll on you. There are resources for caregivers and family members simply because of the physical and emotional impact having a loved one with Alzheimer's can bring, so if you EVER start to feel lost or overwhelmed, don't hesitate to see what's available to help you get through all this as well.

This subreddit is one of your resources. There's always someone here to listen, to offer advice and encouragement, so come back here with updates, questions, etc.

This isn't going to be easy, but once you know your medication options and resources, it will be easier than it is now. Best of luck with finding a way to help your mom be able to manage these symptoms.
Take her to a neurologist. You can tell her it's for a routine because she hit the 62nd birthday. Tell the neurologist all the symptoms you've been observing ahead of time. If she's mostly still competent, she can take medication to slow it down and live at home with an aide to help her bathe and cook a healthy meal a few hours a day. Do you already have POA and could start putting her bills to be online and on autopay?
Call the local Alzheimer’s association, and social services. They have resources that can help you. Among the first things you’ll need to ask them about his power of attorney. You’ll need that to handle her medical ans financial affairs. First, of course, is getting a physician to certify that she’s not fit to handle them.
you haven't mentioned her lifestyle

- exercise?

- favorite foods

- smoke / drink

- current medications

Alzheimers,How to deal with awkward questions from someone with Alzheimer's?,"My mother has Alzheimer's and frequently asks to speak with her parents, I don't have the heart to tell her that they are dead. What would be the best way to deflect this question without upsetting her?

&nbsp;
## **Thank you for all the lovely responses! <3**","You can tell her they aren't at home right now and you can call later. Or call a number like your cell and don't pick up and she can hear that they didn't answer. Stuff like that. 😀
It's okay to fib. Its for her own happiness. Tell her they went to Paris for thier wedding anniversary. The next time she asks think of something she can get get joy from.
Tell her you'll arrange it tomorrow.  By tomorrow, she won't remember the promise.  Just tell her the same thing.  Or for your own amusement, make up new lies.  ""Phone service was disrupted by the recent floods down their way.""
I had the same issue with my mom. She wants to talk to her sister that died about 20 years ago. She said she feels bad cause they drifted apart and she hasn’t talked in awhile. I just tell her I don’t have her phone number, she is good with that answer.
I tell my mom that they are at work.
My father has asked me
*“When is mom coming home?”*

My mother, his wife of 60 years, had died the year earlier from cancer with him and I at her bedside.  

We’ve both gone to her gravesite multiple times.
It’s difficult for him to process it all as you might expect.

In this case it’s really okay to lie.  It’ll save them pain and anguish.

Of course they might make that re-connection and remember on their own later on, 

then you can discuss it.
Tell her they’re out right now but will be back soon.
Beautiful responses to OP, those anxiety-reducing responses have worked for so so many of us.  So sorry again that we are all going through this!
I usually answer with something like ""Oh she's at the store right now you know she hates talking on the phone at the store"" which usually gets her off it for a bit. I also use the usual ""it's late that time she's sleeping, eating, watching her shows ect...""

Sometimes when she's really adamant about it I'll tell her something along the lines of ""Well she got a new phone and I don't have her number yet. Why don't you check if you have it?"" And I'll hand her an address book or her phone with the contacts open and she'll get distracted by seeing one of her friends names in there. It usually brings her in a more positive mood as she tells me about her friends or a date she went on.

My last line of defense right now is to have her call her brother. Sometimes she'll ask for her phone number but usually he deflects and brings up his kids. I've thought about getting a second line on my phone and listing it in her contacts as Mom. We all have the same voice and face in my family which is both a benefit and a curse when it comes to this.",2021-08-04 09:19:02,kaen,oxsio8
Alzheimers,Grandpa’s diagnosis,"My mom told me about a week ago that my grandpa was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. It’s something that we’ve suspected for a couple years, but hearing his diagnosis is still incredibly painful. My grandpa and I are extremely close, and I’m having a very hard time with it. He’s coming to visit us in a few weeks with another family member, so it’ll be great to see him. My step-grandma says that he’s on a medication that’s helping him for now. He’s aware of his diagnosis, and knows what it means. I’m dreading when his condition worsens. I have a very hard time working through grief, and I know that this is going to be one long grieving process.","Hi friend I am very sorry to hear about that. I highly highly recommend looking into therapy. It was so helpful for me and gave me a lot of ways to cope with the emotions I was feeling. Even just talking out what was going on with someone felt good. 

It unfortunately can be a very long grieving process and unfortunately(from just my own personal experience) only gets worse. I cannot emphasize enough how much therapy helped me out here.
Find a support group as early as you can. Having others to vent to will help. For my mom, we're into year 11. I know others who've passed within five years of the diagnosis, but my mom's battle keeps going and going, and as Alzheimer's was always her greatest fear, she's made suicidal comments from the start.

She'll start to degrade, then suddenly level off and even seem to improve very slightly before the next level of deterioration begins. She's in a wheelchair now and is refusing some meals, so we hoped this would go quickly, but even this stage isn't. It's been five months since she started slowly losing weight and becoming less mobile, and it's still just dragging on. For the active, vital woman she was, watching this slow progression is the pits.

The other thing I recommend is finding an outlet for your anger and frustration. I discovered I enjoy pilates and kickboxing. I can't control my mom's disease progression, but I can control how I'm venting my frustration with it.
Very sorry to hear about your Grandpa. Love and light to you and your entire family.
Try to take him out on field trips or mentally stimulating activities, or involved in senior social groups or some kind, while he can. Podcasts or documentaries about interesting topics, puzzles, games, hiking. Make a scrapbook with family photos and have him explain who each person is from his childhood photos (and you may learn something new) while he can. It is like exercise for the brain and it will keep him lucid longer.
You know, you can learn to take joy in the happy moments.  And your beloved Grandpa needs you to do that.  A long face is not what he needs.

What would you rather - Grandpa dead at his current age of a massive heart attack, or Grandpa around for at least 5 additional years, maybe longer, with hugs and kidding and just slowly fading out of the picture?  In the case of my husband with Alzheimer's, I'm grateful for the latter.",2021-08-04 01:50:39,liamrobin,oxm5gx
Alzheimers,How to keep patients hydrated?,"I haven't been able to figure out how to keep my mother hydrated properly. She never drinks water on her own and when i give it to her i'm lucky if she even takes a sip. She barely drinks a bottle of water a day if even that. I think giving it to her in a cup helps and she also seems more willing to drink it when i bring it to her on the toilet (not sure why). If anyone knows of a good method please let me know. Thanks. 

crossposted","My dad will chug water with a straw. A cup he'll ignore or knock over. But, we give him a lidded cup with a metal straw and he'll drain it. We also keep a small tv table in front of him when he is awake so he sees the cup. If the cup is not in his eyeline he won't pick it up.
You could try Jelly Drops. They are 95% water, have electrolytes, and look like candy.
My mom isn't big on water, but she will drink plenty of coffee and tea. Decaf and we just let her have what she wants. She'll also drink seltzer, she likes the bubbles.
My mom won’t drink water but she’ll drink Gatorade all day- and prefers the kind that comes pre-made in small bottles. Horrible for the environment, horrible for her sugar intake, but great for hydration.
Miio/a little bit of juice for flavour and a straw.
Finding a juice or water with electrolytes is very helpful and putting it in a smaller cup so she doesn't become overwhelmed and fill that more often. Also encourage staying hydrated. My Nani has trouble with that but we found a juice that has a lot of vitamins in it that she really likes and give her a small cup of it at a time while my grandpa will comment on how good it tastes as he has a glass too.
Mom wouldn’t drink water, but Crystal Light lemonade saved the day.
Serious question here. Is there anything to put in water that will make it taste like beer? My FIL will only drink beer without a fight. He'll drink a little coffee in the morning and then a little water with his meds. Otherwise only beer. He won't eat fruit, so fruity water won't work.

So last week I see that the assisted living home had added even more antidepressants and antipsychotics which was causing issues and I politely asked to remover her off the zyprexa due to the side effects she was displaying and how far she is out of it. 

This in turned upset my aunts and uncle to the point I’m getting messages stated elderly abuse and all kinds of crazy stuff about lawyers being involved. I’m the poa for moms medical. 

On a side note these new drugs was not prescribed by moms neurologist. So Friday I was in contact with moms neurologist to get them the list of new meds and the one I requested them to remover her off of. This was trying to get mom a better options for care. 

I was in contact with a lawyer Friday also to try and get an emergency conservatorship. I’m thinking that’s a lost cause. 

Thoughts on what to do in this situation.","I'm sorry. I had to block emails and messages from one aunt. She hadn't seen my mom in 10 years and in my lifetime, I think I've only seen her about 10 times. When she started telling me that she knows better how to take care of my mom than I did, and proceeded to tell me how to ""improve your attitude missy."" That was it. I was done. As the POA, she trusted you, not them.
This is pretty common - family members not agreeing with the POA's treatment decisions.  Especially family members who are not closely involved with the patient's care.

Do yourself a solid, and block them.  You have enough stress without that, too.
I have blocked her as of this morning. Also it seems I’ll be now turning to legal counsel to serve a cease and assist letter.",2021-07-31 08:24:53,FieldWelder77,ov67xm
Alzheimers,9 month open trial shows improved cognition in alzheimer's patients,"For people with family members suffering mild to moderate Alzheimer's, a company called Cassava Sciences just release data at AAIC that showed their drug improved ADAS-Cog scores by 3 points over a 9 month period.

In fact, the other commenter in this post saying the drug needs early fda approval is a heavy wallstreetbets commenter, not an Alzheimer’s commenter.

Alzheimers,Traumatizing week,"So this week I thought my dad was dying. He was non responsive the facility called 911. He was admitted to the hospital for two days. Sleeping the entire time. They did blood tests, CT scan, UTI test. Found nothing. But he wouldn’t wake up.  The hospital mentioned he might be getting over medicated. The facility denied giving him more meds. My family and I were starting to think this was the end. My aunts were getting ready to come down and say their goodbyes. I took It a lot worse than I thought.  I had to hire a hospice service. They released him from the hospital and I went over expecting to see my father in his forever sleep. When I walked in he was bright eyed and said oh hi!  I feel like I haven’t seen you in so long!  He was the most clear I’ve seen him in a long time. He declined super quickly in the 6mos hes been in this place. I literally thought my dad was dying and then one of the caregivers proceeded to tell me all this stuff that is going on at the facility. Like there’s a nurse that over medicated to manage the residents. I don’t know what’s the truth but I am so upset. Has anyone experienced this?  This is suppose to be a very reputable facility and very expensive. I’ve started looking at other places but this has really made me lose faith in these places. On top of everything he fell and broke his nose today! My poor dad. I feel so guilty. I did so much research when finding this place. I thought It was going to be so good. I just don’t know where to go from here.","The one thing I know about facility care, of any kind, is that your relative is likely to do best there if you visit frequently and ask a lot of questions.

I'm glad your dad improved!",2021-07-30 00:51:55,No-Consequence-9952,oue14i
Alzheimers,My grandmother's Alzheimer's progression over the years,"My grandmother comes from a family where Alzheimer's is incredibly common and hard to avoid. She was the youngest of 11 children, and every single one who lived long enough developed Alzheimer's - only her mother avoided that fate, who lived until 96 and in full possession of her mind the whole time (the Alzheimer's gene seems to have come from her father, who started exhibiting symptoms during the 1950s at a relatively young age and was almost completely disabled throughout the 1960s). From 1982 up through 2011, she lived hundreds of miles away from us so we only saw her once or twice per year. The June of 2011, she came to live with me and my parents after her husband died, where we cared for her for the next three years until her death.  


**2005 (Age 81)**

Normal, lucid adult full of boundless energy. No signs of dementia no matter how closely you searched for any.

&#x200B;

**2006 (Age 82)**

She had a few weird moments where she repeated herself in a very brief timespan. Otherwise normal. There was a large family reunion which took place in 2006, and Grandmother was nothing more or less than simply another family member, rather than someone who stood out due to being a dependent or a victim of dementia (as she would of course become some years down the road). 

&#x200B;

**2007 (Age 83)**

No real change noted here. This was the last year she remembered to send me a birthday card and the last year she regularly emailed my mom. She drove to our house 500 miles away for my nephew's baby shower with no problems, and displayed no symptoms of Alzheimer's during the few days she spent here (aside from a few instances of repeating herself within a very short time, as per the year prior). 

&#x200B;

She did, however, drive all the way back to the hospital in their hometown 500 miles away when Papa started having some issues with his heart during the visit, rather than going to a local hospital. She explained herself to my mom a few days later over the phone by saying ""I just panicked,"" though my mom found such an extreme lapse in judgment very odd. Since Grandmother overall seemed very normal, though, my mom put the idea of her developing dementia on the backburner, taking a more 'wait and see' attitude unless and until more obvious problems arose.

&#x200B;

**2008 (Age 84)**

Generally normal, though minor symptoms become more common here. Grandmother started replying to my mom's emails more and more inconsistently throughout the year, and stopped entirely by the year's end. She showed some problems with judgment and fell for a few ""prey on the elderly"" scams. My mom visited her that July, and Grandmother burned the turkey that she tried cooking for my mom by leaving it in the oven too long and forgetting about it altogether - something my mom found strange since Grandmother was always very meticulous about everything she did and had an excellent memory, though my mom was unsure if Grandmother was showing early signs of dementia or if it was a simple memory slip resulting from normal aging, since otherwise Grandmother seemed quite normal during the entire three day visit.

&#x200B;

2008 was the last year that Grandmother had full independence. She paid all the bills, she drove into town every week and bought all of the groceries, she managed all operations of the household since my grandfather was physically disabled from a stroke in 2006 (though he remained lucid and cognitively normal for about 2-3 years thereafter). Whatever problems she might have had - and it's possible that she might have had more trouble doing these things than anyone realized since nobody was keeping a close eye on her, assuming she was perfectly 'normal' and capable - she's plainly more or less a normal adult at the end of the day given that she was able to manage throughout the entire year completely unsupervised.

&#x200B;

**2009 (Age 85)**

Things begin to get serious here. As the year progresses she leaves behind ""early Alzheimer's"" territory where the disease is largely an invisible condition, and reaches the cusp of early/mid levels of the illness. This was the first year where she showed clear-cut problems in functioning. Her internet connection had been taken down by August 2009 because she forgot to pay for it, and she had her keys taken away in September after a drive to the grocery store ended with her getting so lost that she ended up on a beach dozens of miles away.  


Grandmother was at a stage where her Alzheimer's wasn't apparent, or at least wasn't *that* obvious, during simple regular conversation, but the cracks in her memory and thought processes were very clear when she had to do something mentally demanding. Grandmother drove my mom somewhere during our yearly visit which that year took place in August, and though the ride was generally fairly smooth with my grandmother seemingly capable of the basic mechanics of driving and remembering the route to the nursing home, there was one point where my mom had to take control of the wheel because Grandmother was driving the wrong way down a one-way road. And later that same day, Grandmother was unsure if we were going to go back to her own home, or to ours. (Since we live about 500 miles away, the answer should've been obvious)

We visited my grandfather at a nursing home that August, who was 91 and in much worse shape (he made a partial recovery and was in much better shape throughout 2010 than he was during either of the two bordering years, but it's a miracle he managed to survive 2009). At the time, I thought of Grandmother as having a foot in two worlds. My grandfather was on the obvious demented, sickly, broken side. Grandmother was MOSTLY on the healthy, lucid, aware side with the rest of us, and she self-identified as a 'normal' and 'healthy' person in stark contrast to her sickly husband's ""broken old man""... but she did have one foot in the world where my grandfather was.

Late 2009, in response to September's beach incident, was where she started to receive some light assistance. My aunt brought her parents groceries, paid all of the bills, and made sure Grandmother remembered to take her meds. Otherwise she was independent.

There's a test known as the Barthel Index. It assesses the independence level of someone based on their ability to do simple things learned in childhood - bathing yourself, dressing yourself, walking unassisted, feeding yourself, using the toilet. At this point there's no question whatsoever that Grandmother would score the maximum of 100 on the test.

&#x200B;

**2010 (Age 86)**

Definite mid-tier Alzheimer's. She recognized everyone and could still hold conversations, but she had little to no memory of recent events and she had no real detailed awareness of her surroundings. In 2009, she remembered that she couldn't remember her computer password; in 2010 she probably didn't know what a computer or an internet was. The 2009 Grandmother's short-term memory was noticeably impaired and spottier than the average person's, but it was far from completely gone or completely nonexistent. 2010 Grandmother's short-term memory, though... yeah, totally gone. If it happened longer than five minutes before, it never happened.

2010 Grandmother was perfectly capable of holding conversations, but only if those conversations were limited to things from maybe the 1990s and older. If you mentioned a friend that she'd made during the past 10 or 15 years, she wouldn't recognize them. Political figures and celebrities that made their debut later than the 1980s or so would just result in a shrug if you mentioned them. Technologies that were popularized during the 90s or 2000s were something she wouldn't recognize at all. She knew perfectly well what a television was and I think she'd recognize certain 80s technologies like CD players (just assuming there based on her overall level of functioning), but there was no way she had any idea what the internet was.  


By this point, the fact that Grandmother has dementia is very obvious even during casual conversation. Conversing with her isn't a frustrating endeavor or anything - if you say anything to her, 9 times out of 10 you will get a reasonable response that shows real comprehension of what you said - but it's still overwhelmingly obvious with even small amounts of contact that she has experienced some amount of transparent cognitive decline.

Still capable of all basic tasks of living. I think she would still get a perfect 100 on the Barthel Index. We visited the grandparents Thanksgiving 2010 - great visit, Papa was doing fairly well and Grandmother wasn't THAT bad yet - and I don't think we had to help her with anything listed on the Barthel Index.

&#x200B;

**2011 (Age 87)**

The more severe end of mid-stage Alzheimer's. She still recognized her kids, but it's unclear if she remembered the grandkids. Her memory of the past became more distorted, and she began telling stories about things that clearly never happened; in 2010 all of her recollections of the past were factual. She began falling asleep around 6 or 7 in the evening, whereas in 2010 she always fell asleep at her usual 10 or 11 PM. She alternated between using a cane and walking unassisted; in 2010 she always walked unassisted. 

She could still sign her name. There was one moment this year where she tried to add two double-digit numbers together, and did so correctly. She was talkative and would go on long monologues, and those monologues were very clear and coherent and easy to follow, but probably 70 percent of the time her responses to things other said had little relation to what was said.

Grandmother's adult sense of social etiquette eroded some here, with some much more childlike moments. During a visit to the grandparents the May of 2011, Grandmother had my brother and my mom move Papa because he was sleeping on 'her side' of the bed (Papa being very frail and skeletal and just a few weeks away from death). During the summer, she removed her medical alert bracelet and put Papa's on instead; when my mom informed her after discovering this that Papa's bracelet was useless for her, Grandmother replied with ""but his is prettier than mine."" And, of course, there was the time in December that she hid my sister's car keys, telling her ""If I can't drive, nobody drives."" 

The grandmother of 2009 and probably 2010 would have handled those situations differently. Despite her decline in memory and function, she still had the emotional maturity of an adult and so would have dealt with those three situations in the same way that she would have prior to developing dementia. The 2009 Grandmother would have identified Papa as a sickly old man and simply let him keep her side of the bed, understood the purpose of the medical alert bracelet and kept hers on, and she wouldn't have gone around hiding anyone's car keys.

This is the first year where there's a decline in Grandmother's Barthel Index score. Using an online calculator, it seems like 2011 Grandmother would get a score of around 70, putting her in the Minimally Dependent category.

&#x200B;

**2012 (Age 88)**

Early severe. She started the year off using a cane most of the time (she continued to walk unassisted sometimes during the early months of the year) and ended it always using a walker. She became a lot more quiet, though she still talked some. Her speech was still coherent. Her responses to others very rarely showed any comprehension of what was said. She still ate on her own. She clearly did not recognize the grandkids. Her recognition of her children was spotty and inconsistent. She slept more frequently than in 2011. In 2011, though she fell asleep in the evenings, she was alert and active prior to then; in 2012 she began dozing off every couple of hours, on and off through the day. 2012 Grandmother would get a Barthel Index score of around 40, putting her in the Partially Dependent category.

&#x200B;

**2013 (Age 89)**

Her speech was largely gibberish by this point with only occasional recognizable words. Early in the year she would open her mouth to let us feed her, but by the end of the year she subsided off tube feedings because she couldn't eat without choking. In early 2013, was capable of moving with a walker so long as multiple people helped her. By late 2013 she was wheelchair-only. 2013 Grandmother gets a Barthel Index Score of around 20, the Very Dependent category.

&#x200B;

**2014 (Age 90)**

Grandmother declined gravely almost the moment 2014 began, with there being an enormous difference between the Grandmother of Christmas 2013 (who, despite the issues talked about in the previous paragraph, seemed to be fairly happy and content - she enjoyed company and laughed a lot at the antics of the great-grandchildren) and the Grandmother of January 2014. She became bedridden and entered a semi-comatose state, sleeping around the clock. Would cry out and panic every time we tried to move her to clean her up. Don't remember her speaking a single coherent word throughout the year. Though Grandmother's Barthel Index scores from 2011 through 2013 are an estimation with a small margin of error, her score for 2014 is very clear - zero, Totally Dependent.   


This phase didn't last too long. She passed away the August of 2014, a few months shy of what would have been her 91st birthday.","This is so sad. Thank you for documenting this and sharing with us. I'm so sorry for your loss. This greatly helps me put my Mom's diagnosis into perspective.
This was so much like my mother’s decline. She passed in January 2021 at age 88. It took about four years from when we first started really noticing issues.",2021-07-30 06:30:10,Casey1987,oui25x
Alzheimers,Mother with Alzheimer’s and Father supporting,"Hi Reddit,

I’m looking for some advice, my mother (72) is going downhill rapidly with Alzheimer’s, my father (70) is a very logical thinker.

Recently my father has purchased a Campervan and to take my mum on away within our country. They have always travelled around the world previously which is obviously now not possible. 

My older brother and sister are dead against this to the point they will not communicate with my dads group text messages to the point they are ignoring my dads messages on their first trip to a family property. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? 

I know my dad will look after my mum 💯 but I’m not sure if I’m missing something, my brother and sister are so against my Dad and I don’t understand why, as I know they love both of them so much. 

Appreciate any feedback from anyone who has been through this before.

(Please pardon my username, created long ago to be a lurker and totally unrelated to my post)","They need to let your dad do what he can to create a shared poignant closing he knows is coming. There will be a time when even taking these type of trips will be impossible. 

So sorry for your situation. Now is the time for your family to pull together to support your dad. Hang in there.
I'm sorry for your situation.  Have you asked your brother and sister why they are against his plan?  

As Alzheimer's disease progresses it is very helpful for the patient to have a consistent schedule in a familiar location.  As more and more critical thinking abilities fade away, the familiar environment and routine can keep them grounded and less agitated.  I can see this as a reason for concern over traveling.
To me, the problem is not that your father cannot take care of your mother alone, but if something should happen to him while they are travelling, you really have a problem.  I understand what he wants to do, but I would either try to talk him out of it or make a plan to have you and your siblings nearby.
Are your brother and sister concerned that mum will wander off on a camping trip?  Other than that, I don't see what the worry would be.",2021-07-29 12:52:17,yourmateremember,ou1b5p
Alzheimers,Anyone else’s relatives with Alzheimer’s start buying weird stuff?,"My dad recently started buying more stuff when he goes out. A few examples is home buying a cookie from the store every time he goes along with him buying me 4 Gatorade’s randomly because I workout. That and just an overall more willingness to spend/buy things for himself or others in the family. Does anyone else have any similar experiences, I think my dad is in the more earlier stages of Alzheimer’s","Yes this was one of the first things we noticed. My dad started buying items in bulk and storing them in his closet. It was mostly lightbulbs, and paper products but you would think he was gearing up for the apocalypse. He did a little bit well with stocks and when he sold them he used them to make some improvements to our home but then kept trying to do more and wasn’t understanding when the money ran out. 

He also would try to cater big family parties but would buy so much of one thing and then the day of the party we would realize so many items missing. He always used to pay in cash but then starting charging his card for everything. Financial problems are often one of the early warning sides I think. 

Good luck and if you are able, go see a neurologist with your concerns.
Birthday cards.   

My mom retired this last January and is with my dad full time now.    He has to get one every time they go out.    Turns out he's been hiding this for awhile.    My mom recently found around 50 in his ""man cave""
When we moved my mom out of her apartment, we were SHOCKED at what we found. Hair nets. Hair nets everywhere. Bought constantly from we don't even know where all ferreted away. My mom has never worn a hairnet or a wig to my knowledge. 

Also an shit ton of memory pills and ""increase your memory"" books. Like she knew something was going on but not really.

Alzheimers,Mom in late 60s going on Aricept. Why?,"My late 60s moms has significant short term memory loss, episodes of confusion that lead to irritability and sun setting in the evening. She has a history of encephalitis that was rather significant and also seizures. The neurologist said that it dose not appear to be Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s yet but they want to put her on Aricept? Does anyone know why they would try such a strong drug without a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer’s? Since they can’t say for certain what is causing the memory issues, is this a way to test to confirm a diagnosis.  Has anyone been in a similar situation and could share the outcome or purpose?","The only way to firmly diagnose Alzheimer's is on autopsy.  If your mother has memory symptoms that are progressing, Aricept is a reasonable choice of drug.   If she has bad side effects from it, they can always take her off it.
I am not at all an expert and my grandma and dad were on this but they had a definite dementia. But the thing your doc may be doing is prescribing it for ""off label"" use. 

https://www.healthtap.com/questions/510139-is-donepezil-used-for-anything-other-than-alzheimer-s-disease/

But there are risks and you guys are entitled to have it explained to you. Its part of the job of the docs that you understand what they are doing, so that it can really be consensual treatment. 

https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/alzheimers-drug-prescribed-off-label-for-mild-cognitive-impairment-could-be-dangerous-for-some

It does look like it could be used in seizures: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104535/ but note this is a research paper and i have no idea the frequency of this in clinical practice. 

I do know with a lot of neurological and psychiatric drugs, sometimes docs will make an educated guess about something to prescribe, and depending on results, they can narrow down what it is. Cuz brain be mysterious. :p If you think this is what your doc is doing, i would be sure to note any changes, however small, and ask doc to provide a ballpark time frame you can expect changes or improvements to be seen, and what the changes might look like. Because if it does nothing good, maybe it would be better to try something else.
It's not yet possible to definitively diagnose Alzheimer's until after death.

Did the neurologist say *why* they think it doesn't to appear to be Alzheimer's or Parkinson's?",2021-07-29 21:07:01,bex1467,ouakbd
Alzheimers,Family disagreement,"My beloved Dad started with forgetfulness about 10 years ago- in October of 2016 I finally had him in agreement to get tested for Alzheimer and then he had a stroke 3 days before the test was to be conducted so of course we cancelled it and went forward with massive rehabilitation for the stroke. fast for to November 2020 another ""stroke"" hit and he was hospitalized for a week with no rehab- my mother kept saying the Doctor said no new medication and I kept arguing back antibiotics aren't a permanent medication he has a UTI- so he suffered for a week after being released from the hospital with crazy symptoms and pain I am sure. My dad today is probably late mid-stages. This past weekend all hell broke loose between my mom and daughter because my mom just doesn't provide the care my Dad needs, truthfully she can't even take care of herself she is covered in bruised from falling and constantly tearing her skin open and weighs about 80 pounds now. My daughter and I would like to take my Dad however she (my mom) will not allow it so she contacted a person connected with the VA and is placing him a VA nursing home 6 hours away from me roughly 4 from my mom and kids. Is there anything I can do to stop this? My mom is a hateful woman and just wants to stick him anywhere and just move on and live her life- which will be very lonely once she places my Dad because myself and my children won't be going around!! Does this disease make families fall apart? Luckily or may be a curse I am the only child and my Dad and his parents were always my saving grace!","My brother often harshly criticized my mother for the way she handled the caring of my dad. My mother often complained to me about how my brother was always criticizing but never really helping at all, and wanted to keep him at distance. I was in the middle, playing the arbiter, trying to keep it together. So yes, it can put a strain on family relationships, which is just adding to the suffering.
This disease is a horrible strain on the whole family.  There are many stories of one sibling doing all the caregiving while the other siblings contribute absolutely nothing except criticism.  It's really shameful.  Any schisms and rifts in the family are likely to come out over decision-making in dementia care.

Unless your father has nominated someone else to be his health care proxy, your mother absolutely can do this.  The spouse is considered next of kin, not parents, siblings or children.  

I'm so sorry about what's happening.  Don't wrongly assume the VA nursing home will be bad for him.  The only issue is how hard it will be for him to have visitors.  Take care.
The VA might be the best option right now.  If she's not caring for him properly, and the VA has an opening, I would go with it.  Where I'm at the VA wait lists are years long.  Getting a spot is nearly impossible.  I wouldn't pass up this opportunity especially with a disease that you know will get progressively worse.  You may be able to/want to care for him for now, but things will get harder and there will be a time when you can no longer care for him.  At that point, the VA will probably not have availability and memory care facilities may be prohibitively expensive.  

I absolutely understand you wanting to be near him. 6 hours away is a long drive.  It's a tough spot you're in for sure.
You can see about getting legal guardianship of your dad.

You can also contact Adult Protective Services ~ You might get the best result by reporting that *both* mom and dad are in need of protection.  Her being covered in bruises and losing weight would likely support that view of things..

You may get some good advice on legal guardianship from  /r/legaladvice.  Include your state if you post there, since the correct advice varies from state to state..

Alzheimers,Tips For Moving Day?,"We are finally moving dad to assisted living in a couple of days, and would love any thoughts and tips on how to make it as smooth as possible. He’s going from a small single family rental home with a great yard for his dog, to a studio unit. He always loved gardening and I know he’s going to miss his outdoor space, although the facility has nice grounds for walks. Fortunately he’s able to keep his dog for now.

My sister and I came in from out of town to help move, and will be here for about 5 days after move in day to be with him as much as possible. 

Lots swirling around in my head between getting him moved in, getting some old larger furniture out of the house, and all the smaller things sorted and packed. Would love to hear what’s worked for all of you, and also what to look out for as he hopefully acclimates over the coming weeks.","Chat with staff at the assisted living place.  I have heard they sometimes recommend family not visit for a week or two after move-in.  Practically all people with dementia who experience a move express a desire to go home.  Possibly having family around a lot causes confusion about that to expect next, and interferes with getting used to new surroundings.

It sounds like quite a lot of downsizing is happening.  Be sure a few family photos in frames are placed in the new apartment.
I'd love to hear the responses you get as well. We aren't there yet, but I think I need to start looking.",2021-07-26 18:56:18,buckone23,osaat0

She no longer walks and is in a partial upright recliner when not in bed at the nursing home.  She has been under hospice care for 3 years now.  This is her 13year living with this.  Prayers to you and him and your family.  This is the longest painful goodbye.  I understand.
I'm with you. My dad was just like that. I know precisely how you feel, the sorrow and the weariness. It's a good thing that your dad is a facility and that you do not intend to put him on a feeding tube. Mine had it, but could not stand it, he tried to remove it but only caused some food to end up in the respiratory tract, causing the pneumonia that was his end.

Hoping that it is of some help, I can tell you that it is true that the bad moments fade away with time and the good memories stay.
Have you contacted hospice?  They should be able to help you with this.

I admit I have not been there myself - yet.  My spouse is in middle stage.",2021-07-26 20:45:56,No-Consequence-9952,oscack
Alzheimers,Best Adult Diapers?,"I am looking for opinions on what brand of adult diapers is the most absorbent and also looks the most like underwear.  My LO is quite young (61), still has a lot of cognitive abilities, but has recently been unable to control her bowels/bladder.  This started a few weeks ago.  I want to get something that will help but also manages to preserve some dignity.  Any thoughts/recommendations?","Where in the world are you?

In the UK we've found Tena pants to be the best. You can ask a Continence Clinic to supply them (need a referral from GP). Aldi pull ups are the next best thing, and cheapest.
We had good results with Depends and Kirkland. Decent coverage and hard to notice, especially with loose fitting clothes.

Can be a pain if you get to the stage where they can't change themselves, but they're more appealing than classic style diapers.

One thing we forgot to consider was the disposal. We got lucky and they just started to allow it in the organic waste (green bin) for Ontario. Otherwise we would've hit our bag limit.

Also recommend a discreet travel bag with spare clothes, wipes, garbage bags, etc. We had a few accidents in public and it was very stressful.",2021-07-26 10:07:34,cmh417,orzfsp
Alzheimers,Genetically have the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's should I bother having a relationship?,"So my mother, her mother, and her father all had early onset Alzheimer's. My mother and her father also had Parkinson's. I recently took a genetic test and both markers showed up in my genes. We still don't know the possibility of me getting it but it's really put me into serious thinking mode. I took care of my mother starting at the age of 14, She was 53. So I've seen the beginning, middle and end of it all. I also saw the terrible time my own father had to deal with his wife declining so rapidly. Look at him now makes my heart hurt, they were together for almost 40 years and he watched his best friend go through all that.

Now speaking on myself again.... Should I even risk a relationship? For my own bodily autonomy I want to be Euthanized should I do develop the issues. It is legal in several countries.

So.. That's my question to you all. Do I just spend the rest of my life alone as to not even bother burdening someone with my own ""selfish"" choices or should I try?","I was primary caregiver for my mom for 10 years until she died. I know that’s not the kind of “relationship” you’re talking about, but caring for my mom as she declined was the most heartbreakingly wonderful experience of my life. It was awful and terribly sad, but it gave me a chance to do something good. You know? I feel like I’m a better person now than I was before. Maybe I redeemed myself just a little bit. Don’t deny yourself love and don’t deny someone else the chance to love you.
I was the primary care giver for my Dad. He was the primary caregiver for his Mom. He always said he'd never change anything. I wouldn't either.
I'm sorry you're facing this.  Is it APOE4 you're referring to?  The first video below is short (about 3 minutes) and talks about APOE4 and it's relationship to cholesterol.  Apparently it's really common in Nigeria but they don't have the higher alzheimer's you would expect because of their traditionally plant based diets with lower cholesterol.

I have some relatives with dementia but I've never had genetic testing done.  I eat a whole food plant based diet, but I think the Mediterranean diet or the Mind Diet can also be helpful.

It sounds like even walking 5 or 6 miles per week can help!

I enjoyed this book, [https://www.amazon.com/Alzheimers-Solution-Breakthrough-Symptoms-Cognitive-ebook/dp/B01N5PY7CU/ref=tmm\_kin\_swatch\_0?\_encoding=UTF8&qid=1627346282&sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/Alzheimers-Solution-Breakthrough-Symptoms-Cognitive-ebook/dp/B01N5PY7CU/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1627346282&sr=8-2) written by 2 plant based neurologists, Drs. Dean and Ayesha Sherzai.

There could also be progress with new drugs by the time you need it.  In February Cassava Sciences announced they improved cognition and behavior in their phase 2 alzheimer's trial and they are looking to start phase 3 trials later this year.  They were awarded $2.7M in funding from the NIH for their research following peer review of their data.

I hope some of that helps.
No one on Reddit could possibly make that call. It's your life, and it's up to you to make that choice. I'd recommend, should you choose to have a relationship, being completely frank about any health concerns with them. If they choose to continue on the pathway of a relationship, fine- you're both going forward from a place of honesty and disclosure. I'd also recommend not shutting yourself away from the possibility of new experiences. We are all living under a death sentence, but it is up to us to make the trip as memorable and fulfilling as possible.",2021-07-26 03:37:26,Intelligent-Treat-99,ortxze
Alzheimers,Does my Father have early Alzheimer's?,"Hi all, 

This is something that I have been struggling with. My father is 71. Before the lockdowns he was functioning normally. During the lockdowns, him and my mother due to the differences of my opinion concerning the lockdown were arguing a-lot. They really don't argue that much so it took a big strain on the relationship. During this time his became a little withdrawn and sulky. 2020 was a crazy year. Then his sister (my aunt) died out of nowhere and that when his mood started to change and so was his memory. In the past several months it seems that his personally changed and he did not want to do anything, he became kind of forgetful and did not seems there all the time. He also would not talk that much and it seems like he was not as sharp. The change was noticeable and it alarmed me and my mother and my aunt. His voiced seemed to of change too. He just seemed tired. My mother and I has scheduled him to get a physical. He can still drive and do other things, he can talk about current events and the like but the decline came out of nowhere and it became worst after his sister died. Like I said he is a bit better because is not as withdrawn as he was a couple of months ago. I just never seen him like this. What do yall think? Maybe a stroke?","Could be depression because of the timing. Anxiety and depression both affect concentration, attention, and memory.

Even if he ends up with a kind of dementia, there are a lot of causes for that too.

But really it will take a doc. A good doc will rule out other causes of the changes before settling on Alzheimer's. A part of that is because other causes of memory probs may be treatable or reversible while Alzheimer's really isn't yet. 

In the mean time, if he's amenable to it, you could just try to talk to him to see if he's aware of the changes and if he has any ideas. And also possibly to just be supportive and make him feel loved. Regardless of the diagnosis, he could probably use the support anyway.
Try taking survey at [cogminder.com](https://cogminder.com) and getting a report.
Keep in mind that, for those aged 70 to 74, only around 3 percent have dementia (5 percent for 75-79, 14 percent for 80-84, 31 percent for 85-89, 40 percent for 90-94, 52 percent for 95+). Dementia is quite rare in the 70s - it's far more likely that he's either depressed or his cognition is being impacted by some other health condition.",2021-07-26 02:33:54,Buggy713,ort4ev
Alzheimers,Father with Alz and loves to walk about everywhere. Looking for a watch-like device for him. Anyone know about the theora connent watch or other similar devices?,"Preface for why we need a watch with safety locks: My father will leave the house with just a shirt and underwear on. Small devices will not work well for tracking my father for that reason along with the fact that he will toss things out his pockets. It isn't unusal for my father to leave the house without shoes either, hence gps tracking soles aren't what we are looking for either. Regular wrist watches will be taken off when he wants to, hence devices like a apple watch aren't gonna work. 

We are looking for a wrist watch with a safety lock feature. We have stumbled upon the theora connect. Anyone have experience with it? Anyone have other options? Thank you for your time.","Maybe sew something into his underwear if he tends to keep those on? You might need to keep a few options, like watch, soles and other devices, to enhance the chance that he keeps one on his person.
I recently bought this for my family member with Alzheimer's who wanders, however, I didn't realize that the battery life is only 20-24 hours, and that it takes 1-2 hours to charge. That's kind of a lot of maintenance, so will not work for us.
Wow if only there were such things when my dad was around. I haven't used it but it looks cool. This site: https://www.alzstore.com/gps-tracking-watch-for-elderly-s/2180.htm names another watch that is also lockable from triloc, and does a comparison on a pdf if you scroll down. 

A quick check of questions regarding the theora watch on amazon showed the manufacturer say its lockable but if they mess with it long enough they will be able to get it off. 

I wouldn't try something like this unless there was a trial period, and i *knew* my Alzheimer's person wasn't going to destroy it in an effort to get it off.

My dad had one of those medic alert bracelets, and he kept taking it off and eventually broke it at one of the metal links.

There was another post some time ago about tracking tiles that can be used.. Maybe thats worth looking into? If you can attach it to his clothes or something.

If you dont find a solution right away, i suggest maybe sewing fabric tags in his clothes in the mean time with his name and address and your phone number. In case hes in trouble and the police get him. Put it in the back so he doesn't know its there. 

Sorry im not more helpful. But thanks for sharing about these! Good luck!
We used Gizmo. It's a kids phone that also has GPS on it.
You have to keep him confined to the house for his own safety and the safety others. Baby proof the house and get smart cameras setup if you can’t get supervision. My mother was found walking on the side of a highway while I was at work… that’s when I realized she can’t be left unsupervised. Imagine if she caused an accident to happen then I would have been somewhat responsible knowing her propensity to wander.",2021-07-25 15:49:50,deathmine31,oriimu
Alzheimers,My 75yo Aunt has been formally diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and I need some advice.,"Hello, as the title states, my Aunty has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. This has been a long time coming and is not surprising. I would estimate she has had issues with her memory for about a decade now and it has been painfully obvious to my mum (her sister) and I that something was wrong. Her kids are not very helpful and have been in denial about the whole thing up until she got diagnosed. 

I’m not exactly sure how far it has progressed, but what I do know is that she is no longer allowed to have a drivers licence and repeats herself a lot. Sometimes she will tell the same story 3 or 4 times in the span of a conversation. Just for clarification I never bring this to her attention because I feel it would be upsetting for her. She gets confused about her grandchildren’s names and sometimes doesn’t recognise them in photos. She has also stopped all of her hobbies over the years, for example she used to draw, sew, make candles, etc. Her handwriting has become quite shaky as well. She is really a shell of her former self and it is horrid to see. 

My Aunty is very dear to me and I wanted to be an Aunty when I grew up because of her. 

I guess the advice I need is how to talk to her about it when she brings it up. She will sometimes say she’s mad and belongs in an aged care home, and is quite aware she is forgetting things but she doesn’t know what she’s forgotten. The last time I saw her she told me she had gone too far in the wrong direction and she had tears in her eyes. I just don’t know what to say. I want to be able to comfort her but have no idea how.","Just try to be there for her the best you can. Let her repeat herself, just tell her you love and care for her when your around her. Not trying to be dark
Or anything but her memory functions will likely only get worse and you will regret not taking in moments when they were just a bit forgetful and repetitive speaking from experience. Sending many hugs it’s painful journey. Just be there the best you can.",2021-07-25 10:41:45,kolbyt,orcs48

It didn't work at all for her. her anger was worsening, too. It also ruined it for us as we had success in keeping her calm by taking her out for fish and chips and a pint when we'd visit. Once she was on it, we were told no more beers for her. After she allegedly attacked a nurse and sprained/fractured (differing stories) the nurse's wrist, my mom was put into the hospital and deemed a danger to herself and others. She's on Haldol injections now and it seems to work better, though now she barely talks.

Alzheimers,Am I a bad person for not wanting to visit my grandma with Alzheimer's?,They gave her a week left to live. I just don't know if I can see her like this. She is not even there anymore and part of my asks what the point is of even visiting her. Am I a jerk?,"No, you're not a jerk. Your reluctance is completely understandable. Losing a loved one to Alzheimers is extremely difficult and can be traumatic if what is left of the person you love is significantly different from what you remember. 

That being said, your grandmother's condition and your reaction to it are not the only things to take into account when you make your decision. Depending on your cultural and familial values, you may find yourself experiencing guilt and/or shame for not visiting, and with death so close, it's not something you can go back and fix days, weeks, or years later. Also, your parents, your aunts and uncles, cousins, and siblings may need your presence and emotional support at this time. Finally, death by Alzheimers is usually quiet and peaceful. If they're in a medical facility, there are professionals tending to them. Hopefully, hospice is involved, and they can be of great help.

Personally - and this is only me and my opinion - I would go if I could it without stressing out my family. If you're having trouble with your response to your grandmother's condition, you could go with the focus being to offer support to your other family members. Take a moment to touch your grandmother's hand, tell her you love her, and say goodbye to her. While she isn't there anymore to hear your words, they're still important to you, and I think you'd be surprised how much good that kind of deliberate farewell can do. Now, this all depends on having had a neutral to good relationship with her. If she was abusive, then all bets are off. Take care of yourself first, your family second, and her third.

Don't be afraid to talk to someone whose character you respect or admire. Often times, they can explain why they make the choices they do, and even if you don't agree with them, it can shed light on how to make your own decision.
You aren't a bad person.  What you're feeling is perfectly normal.  If she is constantly surrounded by family and you are worried about a panic attack you have good reasons not to go.  Watching a loved one die with Alzheimers is hard enough. Give yourself some grace here.
You have intense emotions and fears surrounding this event. That is valid, and understandable. When my mother died, my oldest brother did not visit her in the nursing facility. ""I just can't stand to see Momma like that!"" Sometimes, it's not about what you need, but about what others may need from you. Your presence, your support, you being an important part of the unified whole, all are very important. I assume you are quite young. There will be occasions in this life where you will just have  to suck it up, do what needs to be done, and not do a fade. My brother died a month ago. He never got to hold her hand that one last time. We don't know the eternal value of doing those final acts, but we should do what we can, while we can. I myself had the privilege of giving my Mom the last morsel of food she had on this Earth. A small thing, but a thing I treasure. Be at peace, find your strength, and support your people.
Even if she doesn't remember your name, she probably does remember she loves you however lacks the ability to communicate. I tell my mother I don't care if she does not remember me. I remember her, and that is why I visit. Sure I feel guilty not visiting more, but it would crush me to live in hindsight not expressing my love for her, to her. Go visit and be strong!
Well, there are two reasons to go.  One is to set with her and say goodbye quietly so you don't have to wonder if you're a jerk. 

But possibly the more important reason is, to support your other family members.
You should visit, she is dying would you be ok if no one came to see you when you were dying?
Go.",2021-07-24 16:45:30,hidieho74,oqxutt
Alzheimers,"Mom newly diagnosed with early onset, and I am the worst caregiver","My mom will be 64 next month and was formally diagnosed earlier this month with early-onset Alzheimer's after a year of trying to get her into doctors appointments and testing. I'm 31F. She moved in with me in early February, when it had become very apparent that she could no longer manage living on her own. My living room is now her bedroom. She was put on Donepezil the day she moved in with me, and was on it for three weeks before it dehydrated her (constant and severe diarrhea) to the point of passing out, and she was in the hospital for three days. We're supposed to be starting the Rivastigmine patch soon to see if that does bypass her GI system well enough for any possible improvements.


I have loved my mom more than words can express, and she provided me with a really wonderful and enriching childhood, but we've always had a very volatile relationship. I don't even know why. Hoping to get that figured out, as I'll finally be starting therapy soon. She was a single parent, and we were really over dependent on each other. I have been stuck in the anger phase of my grief since she moved in, and I hate every single day of my life. I have completely emotionally detached from her in the sense that I no longer have a mom, but I still care about her enough that I am incredibly protective of her. I know she loves me so much, but I don't feel like I have that maternal protector anymore. Someone I can count on. My mommy. She's still ""here"" ​and mostly lucid, but her capacity to understand life in general has greatly and depressingly diminished so fast. I'm weary of not being with her, and the thought of eventually putting her in some sort of memory care housing terrifies me (even though we so desperately need it already) because I don't want her to be abused or taken advantage of. We are completely in a ""child has become the parent"" scenario, and I am having the worst time coping with the way she can no longer do things for herself like dress or speak properly, bathe, eat without making a huge mess, etc.


I have a really difficult time with controlling the way I react to her when she can't do something, even though I know it is completely not under her control. She's also so incredibly stubborn, and is having a really difficult time accepting that this is our reality and that I haven't been making all of this up. She is convinced that I'm not letting her do things like use a computer because I simply don't want to, when the complete fact of the matter is, she doesn't understand how to use a computer, her iPhone, her iPad, or even a tv remote anymore. And of course, this makes me look bad to anyone who is willing to listen to her make this all up, because she only sees it as me preventing her from doing these things. She really resents me for the fact that her driver's license was revoked, and that she never got to make the decision that she wouldn't be able to work anymore. I hate that I am making some of the last memories that she can retain be ones where she thinks I'm mad at her. I know it should be the absolute opposite. 


She has had a shit go at life, and for this to be what's going to end her life is shittier. I was the result of an abusive relationship with a drug addict, and I think she has a lot of unspoken traumas about that. She lost both of her parents young. She was in her 40's, when she was a caregiver to her mom while her mom was sick with and died of lung cancer. My mom's career suffered because she basically quit to take care of her mom, and then the recession happened, and really just screwed her over after that. She's got two younger brothers who really aren't going to be there for her because they're too self involved, and they've also had strained relationships over the years. She has no retirement money, only a small amount of savings that she was able to build up when she was working at her last job. I'm still in the process of getting her set up with SSDI. She does have a settlement coming soon due to an unpaid overtime and wage theft case from her former employers, but the attorney and the IRS will get the majority of it. Whatever is left when she finally gets paid will get put into a trust for her care. She was a caregiver for a man with dementia, and his daughter refused to pay my mom legally. She worked for nearly two years, because they had a truly incredible bond, but the daughter finally let my mom go after noticing her own symptoms present themselves. The fact that I now fully understand just how much work goes into being a caregiver, and how much caregivers truly should be paid will never be lost on me. Occasionally, when she's really upset, she'll ask to clarify that she didn't contagiously catch the Alzheimer's from the man she cared for. That's hard to hear each time, especially because this is not something we ever would have imagined. We don't have a family history of it. She was just supposed to be the caregiver of a person with Alzheimer's, not develop it too.


I just feel like I'm drowning. Like when a wave knocks you out and you don’t know which way is up because you’re just tumbling every which way under the wave. I am strong, but I am not okay. I fear that my stress and anger will be what kills me because of this. I truly would prefer that this disease takes her quickly so that we're both not suffering for years to come. I know what to expect from this disease and the thought of having to endure this for YEARS kills me. My only hope is that because of how rapidly she has progressed, it will, but I obviously have no control over that. It kills me even more to be having these feelings that I would rather my mom no longer be alive than have to participate in this journey with her. I never in a million years would have been able to imagine life without my mom as a child, and I am struggling to balance out those feelings with the feelings I have now. I am terrified that I will never get to have children or a family of my own with her in my life the way things are. I always imagined she'd be the kind of mom who would be helping me raise my kids like her mom was to me. And on the subject of children, how is it that I am otherwise an incredibly nurturing and compassionate person, have had a career of working with children, and desperately want my own, but I don't even want to take care of the woman who wanted me more than anything and brought me into this world? I feel like an indentured servant. We had no choice but for me to drop everything in my life to take her in. I don't make enough money to truly be supporting us. Maybe if I at least had her in her own bedroom and bathroom, but I will never be able to afford a 2 bedroom on what I make right now, nor will I be able to even consider memory care without financial aid (but it's not like the financial aid doesn't come with it's own logistics in terms of assets and finances). I'm so jealous of anyone, but especially friends who still have parents that are perfectly capable of caring for themselves. My mom won't ever get to be one of those older people who has ""golden years."" My best friend lost her mom at 56 to brain cancer two years ago, and was a complete rockstar caring for her mother, and her mother's mother. She lost them both that same year to cancer. I have incredible guilt for sharing my feelings about my mom with her, knowing how much she wishes her mom were still here. Sometimes, she'll get an attitude of her wanting to fight the disease as if it is something she can fight. And I don't want her to. I don't think she really understands what to expect from this. 


I hate sharing my bathroom with her. I hate that I constantly only want to be in my room now. I hate every single time she won't close the lid before she flushes the toilet. I hate how she has things she tries to tell me, and she just can't get the words out or describe things coherently. I hate how I have to tell her she needs to take a shower, and how she can't turn the water on and off for herself in the shower, but she has no problem randomly turning the cold water off when she's not done rinsing and then somehow turn the hot way up, and then gets stuck under scalding hot water until I can dash over to turn it off. I hate how her clothes are a constant battle now. I hate how she plays with her clothes because it's her ""busy work,"" but she's not actually folding them. She's just picking them up and down on her bed. When she's not putting her clothes on inside out or backwards, or sticking her arm straight through the head hole of a t-shirt to wear it like a one shouldered top, she's changing her clothes three times a day for no reason at all, and she doesn't even know why she does it. Or how she'll put her underwear on over her pants, or a disposable underwear on OVER her underwear, wasting them both when she has an accident. I hate that I have to explain or ask her to do something five times in a row. I hate that she has a huge bed, but only sleeps on one edge of it and doesn't understand how to center herself in it or not sleep sitting up. I hate that she thinks I'm gaslighting her half the time because she just can't comprehend the situation. I hate when she's crying, smacks her head with her hand, and talks about her ""dumb brain."" I hate when she cries in general, which is multiple times a day, I don't see my mom, who is a sad, 63 year old woman. I see the little girl version of her, a little girl who is just so lost. She cried yesterday about how ""this wasn't what she was supposed to grow up to be."" How fucking heartbreaking is that?  I hate the defeat when she just can't explain what should be a simple thought. I hate that I don't know how to comfort her. I hate that I don't have the compassion I know she deserves, especially coming from her only child. That I don't have the same resolve to care for her like she did with her mother. I very rarely give her hugs anymore, we were so attached when I was a kid, I slept in her bed with her until probably middle school. We cuddled in our big chair every night before bed. We used to call each other three times a day after I finally moved out on my own. She sent me to Europe and Australia in school programs, and I called her nearly every day with prepaid phone cards. That's when it all started. It all got tiring very quickly, but I did it because I knew she counted on it. How do these feelings just go away? How did I get so cold and how did I shut down like this? I don't know how to warm up to her again without it just feeling fake and forced. I hate that I know that she is going through a hellacious, traumatic, life destructing experience, and how I feel like I can't do anything for her. I hate myself for how I feel about our life.


I think about how I'm not going to have many pictures of her or us together as she ages for as long as she's here. I can't bring myself to want any to remember these days. Nor am I the type of person to just jump next to her for a selfie for the fun of it. I struggle with loving her the way I used to. Everything just feels like a chore, and I'm the only one who can do anything. I know that I do really love her and it's the disease I hate. I just don't know how to project that and fix this. I know that she'll be way better off if someone else is caring for her, but I don't know when we'll be able to get to that point. She is absolutely eligible for a home health aide through Medi-Cal, but I can't even have friends over anymore, my apartment is so cluttered with stuff we haven't been able to deal with since she moved in. I know we need the help, but I can't stand the thought of having a complete stranger in my house with junk everywhere. I know there's respite care, which I desperately need, and she also just needs more social interaction and activities to do, but again, I'm terrified about leaving her anywhere. I just don't know where to start with anything now. I feel like I've been running a marathon for the past year just to get her to a diagnosis, and I'm now crawling wearily and exhausted to the finish line, and we're really only just getting started.


I have really lost enjoyment to do anything, even basic things like decorate with the tons of seasonal decorations I have, or a reusable calendar that I had made with various themed magnets. I really took pride in things like that around my home. I miss my old life. I have really great friends, but they can only do so much. She has some friends, but not a large enough circle like she used to, to build a close support system for herself. She was otherwise a really well liked person when I was growing up and afterwards. She never found love. And now she's just stuck with me. I work because I have to, and this is the first stable job I've had in two years after nannying and contract work in the tech industry, and it has health benefits. But it's soul sucking. I'm just trying to stick it out enough to see how I can move into a leadership role. I hate the work, but I'm really good at it, so I know that I'm somewhat valuable in terms of efficiency and productivity. And respected. Thankfully, I get to work from home for now, but it's also hard when she's barging in on me while I'm on the phone with customers, because she's concerned about a scam call coming in on her phone. On top of grieving the mom I no longer have, I'm grieving the end of a three year, long distance relationship. He completely ghosted me. The pandemic really fucked everything up for us, and I know it could be said that I clearly dodged a bullet, but I really love him. I believed he was the person I had waited so long to meet, my lifetime in a reason, a season or a lifetime. I guess our season just changed, but I feel like I'm never going to get over him or be angry enough to want to get over him. I'm sad that there's no closure after a head over heels first couple of years and trips back and forth. The last thing he said to me as I was boarding a plane to come back home the last time I saw him in person was ""I'll see you before too long."" I can't get that out of my head. It just makes me so sad. I was really counting on ""before too long."" I hate that I feel like the idea of trying to start dating again or finding a partner feels impossible. And it's all I've ever wanted.


If you've gotten this far through my long, disorganized, rant (and if you have, thanks. These are all thoughts I've been needing to release for awhile now), how do you do this? I don't want to do this. I don't want to see the days where my mom doesn't remember who I am. I don't want to get further into delusions and things that are happening in her head that aren't happening in real life. I don't want to have to be one of those family members calling police and putting out a silver alert because she's wandered off. I don't want to deal with the fact that she'll put a nightgown on like it's a skirt and put a different shirt on with it, or how she'll wake up in the mornings, walk into the bathroom, and just pee all over the floor. How do I get rid of this anger? How do I come out of this alive? How do I deal with losing her and her truly losing her mind? How do I just come up for air?


TL;DR: Mom has early onset Alzheimer's and I don't have the emotional capacity to handle it, but I have no choice not to","First, know that I, and therefore others, did listen to what you had to say.  Hang in there, kid.  You are ok.  What you are going through sucks, but do not let it drag you all the way down.  Reach out when you need to.  To us, to friends, to whoever you need to.
This may seem kind of tangential, but you’re a good writer. The passion, the anger and the sense of loss really come though. Write about this time in your life. My mom (diagnosed in 2011) just died last year. I was her primary caregiver and I shared many of your emotions. I’m trying to write a “book”. I put that in quotes because I realize it will probably never be a real book that people actually buy. It’s helping me deal with all of these shitty memories though and that’s good enough.
The only other thing I can say is to laugh whenever you can. Laughing through tears or anger is okay…more than okay, actually. It’s necessary.
I could have written many of the things you wrote (although not as eloquently) and I also struggle with the guilt of not being a good enough care giver for my mom. But I try to remember guilt is a wasted emotion. All you can do is your best and you’re doing it! Solidarity.
Talk to a therapist.  You need to take care of yourself as much as you need to take care of your mom, and it sounds like you need some coping strategies.  It isn't easy, but you will have to say ""it's the disease, not the person"" to get thru some moments.
Admitted:  I stopped reading about halfway through.  Still, I'll offer you a little advice.  1. You mentioned therapy.  That's a great idea. 2. join a caregiver support group.  There are many, both local/in-person and also some online.  3. Just because your mom needs a lot of care, does not mean you have to be the one providing it.  4. You should be looking into memory care places now, because it sounds like she's about ready for one.  I know, I am putting off looking, too, but my loved one is not as progressed.  5. Contact your area's Aging and Disability Resource Center (in the USA) or other agency for aging.  6. Not every memory care place is bad or abusive.  They say visiting often is the best prevention against neglect of a patient.

Good luck.  This is an  unfair situation both for you and your mother, and I'm sorry it is happening to you.
It sounds like you feel isolated and trapped, but you're not alone in this! It's not a reflection of how much you love your mom or appreciate her. It's merely an honest appraisal of your comfort and skill level regarding the care she needs. Loving her doesn't mean you should automatically know how to manage her as a dementia patient. It takes specialized knowledge, skill, and experience to be an effective caregiver -- and a bit of emotional detachment, to be honest.  You can't be helpful and provide attentive care when your heart is breaking and you're worn down from sorrow and frustration.

It's wise to recognize your negative feelings. Many people feel the same way, so don't be hard on yourself. Some people are just not emotionally suited for caregiving or ready for it, whether because of an overly busy life with career / family, or from strained childhood-based memories with the loved one, or personal temperament traits that are contrary to giving care (impatience, irritability, or other personality quirks). 

Sometimes the frustration is more about skill level -- not knowing HOW to take care of someone with dementia. It's a learnable skill (check out [Teepa Snow's videos](https://teepasnow.com/resources/about-dementia/) for insightful ideas), but sometimes skill won't be enough. If you find yourself getting angry easily and feeling resentful, depressed, and frustrated, you won't be able to provide the unconditional kind of care she needs, even if you try to ""buck up"" and suppress or change your negative feelings in the name of duty or love.

For those of us who know we aren't the best fit for caregiving, the most responsible and loving alternative is to find exceptional outside help -- professional, experienced caregivers -- who can reliably and willingly step in to provide daily care. Hiring an in-home professional caregiver or placing a loved one in a facility that specializes in memory care are two common alternatives. Other ways to provide relief for caregivers are by using temporary services such as adult daycare centers for a few hours a day, and/or rotating caregiving shifts with relatives.

Whichever solutions you and your family decide upon, it's an act of love and not abandonment, as long as you stay involved, monitor the quality of care, and visit the patient often enough to maintain a personal connection. (Note: This ""connection"" is more between you and the professionals, not as much between you and the patient, because eventually the patient may not recognize who you are. The professionals you hire should know who you are, though, and your frequent presence and involvement will encourage them to value the patient as someone's loved one rather than a task.
don’t apologize for the long rant, that’s what this sub is for! i’m 21m and my Mom was diagnosed with early onset a few years ago. i too feel like i’m the worst caregiver sometimes, but remember this is an extremely difficult battle for both you and your Mom. keep your head up and stay present. practicing mindfulness, therapy, and support groups have helped me tremendously. you are strong and doing your best!!!
Not to be weird but are you the Shady-Pines-Ma from Makeupalley? If so, I remember you from the cafe!
In some ways, caring for an adult is harder than caring for a child. Where a child has no experience of the world, an adult has and can express and feel the pain of losing their intelligence and independence. They’ve been there and done that and get angry and sad when they see those younger in charge instead of the other way around.

Someone recommended Teepa Snow’s videos, and those are a great resource for caregiver skills. But you also need some sort of relief from that caregiving - even if it’s just adult daycare for a few hours.

While I know the idea of a care facility is terrifying, not all are bad. I work in one, and what I can say is that we all love our residents 100%. We do our best to care for them. Nothing in life is perfect but we’ve never had a staff abuse case, and I see it in my coworkers every day. You should - might be close to having no choice - in looking for one. Your mother sounds at the right level for accidentally starting a fire with the stove, or starting to leave the apartment. What happens if she wanders and gets lost in the middle of the night? As scary as it is, being proactive means you have more choices in figuring out where she goes and how to get her in. There are places with waiting lists - getting her on a list means that by the time there is no choice, she will be where you want her to be.

Take care of yourself. Alzheimer’s runs in my family, and I had an aunt with early onset. It’s not easy, but there are resources to help with the mental, emotional, and physical load of being a caretaker.

This IS beautifully written. I’d love to invite you into my community, my FB group is called Mastering Your Energy as You Navigate Eldercare ☀️

I’m 30F as well, and have spent the last 10 years serving in this space to help family caregivers just like you. CAREbyChristie.com is where you can learn more but even if you aren’t interested in that, please know you’re doing an amazing job. Even though it is incredibly warranted to feel frustration, overwhelm and heaviness- know that you’re not alone in this journey! ❤️

I admire your writing skills, and your experience is one that needs to be shared with and heard bu others to see they are also, not alone in this.
Empathize not emphasize!
Are you in the states ? I know exactly how you feel I was having a mental breakdown from all the stress with no end in sight. Once I got my mom on Medicaid our situation improved dramatically. We were able to get an aid 48 hours a week and now she will be going to a nursing home. I thought I could take care of her myself but reality hit me hard. It’s actually a good thing that she doesn’t have a lot of money. That’s the biggest barrier to care imo. Fortunately my mom didn’t have that much either so I found an agency that basically did all the paper work for us for free (some people charge 10 grand for that service) . Please look up local social services/agencies and get her on Medicaid ASAP.
I’m glad you were able to get that off of your chest.
I think you really need to look into a Medicaid/Medicare approved facility for her. I’ve worked in alz/psych for 15 years and it sucks and it only gets worse. I don’t know where you live but here in Colorado we have a facility called namaste they only take dem and alz patients there is always a wait but I would look into getting her on the list and they take Medicaid/Medicare
I just wanted to say thank you for writing this. I feel like I'm not alone for the first time when reading your experiences and feelings with a mom with dementia. I am experiencing all the things you are. It came out of the blue with my mom and I have never experienced anything like this and am dealing with it every day. Every day her delusions get worse and I lose one more method of communication with her. She thinks her cell phones are all bugged, so she wont respond anymore, so I transitioned to using her landline to communicate with her, and now she thinks 'they' control that too. I feel so resentful some times that her mind has created all of these issues and I am left to manage her on a daily basis which is becoming harder and harder. But I dont have a choice like you dont have a choice. What are we going to do? Our moms loved us and raised us, and we have all of the memories of them and we are all they have left at the end. Its easy to get mad and resentful, but I think we have to come to acceptance that this is the only real path for us. I cant abandon my mom in a facility and I think the same thing is true for you. So we have to reach acceptance for inner peace. Just know there are others who are going through the same things and you are not alone. I feel like God gives us a path to follow. And its not always easy or what we thought it would be, but these things, this path, is the path we were meant to be on from the beginning.
I just found this post, and first i’m really sorry this is happening. I’m in a really similar situation and your post resonated with me. I have to ask, have you found a way to become warm with her again? I haven’t hugged mine in a very long time, i struggle with any simple affection now. and i don’t know why, because i love her very much. it’s like a defence mechanism- i know i’m losing her so i don’t want to be more attached? do you feel the same ? but i want to try and be more outwardly warm, i just can’t figure it out right now. Please let me know if you found any insight into this! Sending love your way
1. You’re a damn good writer. Keep it up. 

2. Get some help. Find an advocate, and start looking at memory care facilities with Medicaid beds. It sounds like you’re going to need those sooner, rather than later.

3. As soon as you can, get *all* assets out of her name that you can.  Medicaid does a 5 year lookback, via IRS records. For having too much income can mean a delay in getting Medicaid benefits.

4. find some help for yourself. Does she have any friends who can offer you some respite? Any family members would help out?

5. I know this is hard, but try and take care of yourself. You can’t help her if you don’t take care of yourself.
I have this to offer. Most have already said it. Find someone to talk to. A therapist may not work for you. I couldn't find a therapist who really got it. The person who ended up being my shoulder to cry on was the nursing director at a local memory care residential community. She saw all of the sides of Alzehimer's and got it better than any therapist. She's a leading reason that we did everything we could to get my mom into that community and keep her in there as long as we possibly could. A long-time family friend also happened to be going to through her own experiences after her husband was diagnosed, and she became my second support person.

I do say that quitting your job is a horrible mistake. Keep the one you have, even if you don't love it. I was pushed into quitting my job as my manager felt I was requesting too much time off when my dad had his stroke and passed away a month later. It sucks because the job was challenging, but I never hated it. I just hated some of the clients we had to deal with. I went back to working from home, and why I like what I do, there are no benefits when you're a contractor. 

The challenges that come up with the mid- and late-stages of Alzheimer's will be more intense. Get ready for a bumpy ride. My mom and I were buddies, but it turned to a point where she cannot see me without hearing her tell me how much she hates me and that I should go away and never return. Then she became angry and started attacking everyone. Her rage was extreme, so she's fully medicated now to keep her calm and keep the paranoia at bay. 

My mom's into year 11 with this cursed disease. Like you, I wish she'd just die in her sleep and be done. She's certainly never been happy with any of it. She even asked her doctor and attorney about assisted suicide, but Alzheimer's doesn't qualify because, by the time you're in the final stages, you're ""no longer in your right mind."" That infuriated her to no end. She's now in a wheelchair and non-communicative, so we think she may finally be at the end of her battle. I wish it would go quick, but it's proven to be just the opposite with the other stages, so I have this feeling that another year or two of the lack of communication and zombie mom are going to be how it is.
So much of your post resonated with me, it almost took my breath away. Keep writing, keep venting, keep sharing. People on this sub understand and won’t judge these feelings. I’m 39 and have been my mom’s caregiver since her diagnosis 6 years ago. I go nuts when people say “you have to take care of yourself” - as if it’s so easy - but it’s true. I wish I could give you a big hug. Please feel free to DM to talk if you need to.
Hey there - I know this is a bit old (it came up in a search for best dishwasher rinse aid for hard water for some reason 🤪), but just wanted to reach out & see how things are going. 

A lot of your emotions really resonated with me from when my dad was dying from lung cancer and I felt compelled to say that your feelings are completely valid/understandable and that you are not alone in having them. Your self-awareness of why you are feeling what you are feeling instead of just floundering in reactive mode puts you miles ahead of many others in similar situations. 

Which leads me to the other reason I wanted to comment. The part you said about being stuck in the anger part of grief is the first time I’ve been able to understand how I was such an utter and complete bitch to my father when he was dying. 

Fifteen years of therapy & not once has anyone pointed that out. Instead, my memories of him & missing him have been forced to the background behind the complete shame and guilt I’ve carried about the lack of empathy I view myself as having had when I look back on myself. 

No matter how much I have worked on self forgiveness & reminded myself how devastated my father would be to know I’ve spent 15 years feeling awful about myself because of a brief portion of our time together, I haven’t been able to let go because I just can’t relate to that person I was then. 

So, **thank you so much for setting me free**. (Honestly *way* more useful than finding the best rinse aid 😆)

I feel sorrow that it’s at your expense & your experience however, and I hope that you are able to find your own peace as you navigate through this ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hi there! I know I am super late to this post but I'd like you to know how helpful I found it. FWIW I think you sound like an exceptional caregiver. I'm in a similar position - 33M and stuck with my mother with Alzheimer's. I've been combing this sub for perspective all afternoon because these last few months have been particularly draining on my mental health. But unfortunately, no matter what, the obligation to give care never lets up. I relate so much to your feelings of hatred and guilt and isolation. To not wanting to start dating again because it feels impossible in this situation. In fact, your post makes me realize I'm not nearly as articulate in expressing these emotions as I should be. As others have pointed out - you have a way with words. I think I'm going to look into care giver support groups.

Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for the post and I hope you continue posting here. I'm rooting for you.",2021-07-24 14:11:17,shady-pines-ma,oqv4vs
Alzheimers,Door alert/Tripwire sensor that links to a smartphone?,"Dad's a wanderer. At night, we can lock and bolt the doors, and he doesn't get too upset about that (yet). But in the daytime, if he can't open doors, he gets violently upset. When the doors are open, he has a habit of sneaking out and trying to go for walks, which would be great, except he can no longer find his way home. So we're looking for a 'tripwire' - a piece of security equipment that can detect a door opening and send an alert to mom's smartphone. We don't want anything loud, as Dad is noise sensitive, and we don't want to wake the neighbours.

Alzheimers,Would a local adult day care be feasible?,"Just thinking. Rather than several individuals paying for a carer, could a few families pool so a few carers look after multiple people?","I am a little confused - there already is adult day care. At some point though people do need more individual attention than a day care can give.

Edit - I’m the the USA i don’t know about other countries
I'm in the US.  My spouse is a veteran and gets a good deal from the VA.  I have a number of fully paid visits at a day care, and after that limit is reached I have a co-pay of only $15 a day.  Right now, he goes two times a week.  I think if I paid full freight, it's $75 a day.

The thing is, the socialization and arts, crafts, light exercise, music, etc. is actually good for the brain, and I don't have the energy for that at home.  We did have him going to a ""memory cafe"" (which was free, through an Alzheimer's organization) once a month, and he seemed to enjoy it.

My goal is to keep him at home as long as humanly possible but not deprive him of things he might get in assisted living; he seems happy most of the time, and is ALWAYS in a good mood when I pick him up from the adult day care.

It's not a substitute for facility care, although they can dispense medication, take vitals, do hand/foot care, and help with a shower.  I feel very grateful to Catholic Charities for running such a good program.
In USA the adult daycares are often a part of a memory care unit in a nursing home. Maybe UK nursing homes offer something like that?
I’m in the US and we have many Adult day cares in our area. It cost about $90-100 per day and provides meals, socialization, activities and support with anything the person needs throughout the day (toileting, meds etc.) People are usually there around 6 hours and they also have a bus that takes them to and from the center. I always say it’s more enriching than in-home care and cost less for the hours you get.
Adult day in my area (U.S.) runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., which never fit with work schedules. My mom is British and always wanted to go home for retirement. The U.K. does have [adult day](https://www.carehome.co.uk/day-care-centres/index.cfm/searchcountry/England), but it's only in some areas.

I got my bachelor’s in Chemistry and studied apolipoproteins associated with Alzheimer’s. I now work with a few Alzheimer’s patients and I 100% believe it helps.
Just one more area where there is no real research because we continue to label MJ as a schedule 1 narcotic.
If you search for gummies in this sub, dementia, and aging parents, you will find stories of people giving their parents either THC or CBD gummies with positive results. It helps with pain, sleep and aggressive behavior.
I'm curious to hear other experiences as well. I asked my dad's doctor about it, but he kind of dismissed it since he felt it would cause more slowness.
Before my Dad got put on his actual meds, Mom found that a toke or two in the evening would help calm him a bit.

That said, once we got him on mood-stabilizers that worked, we had to drop the toke, because they interact negatively together.

Alzheimers,"Evenings seem to be worse for memory, frustrating. How to prevent that?","I just became my Moms primary caretaker and I’m learning so much over the past couple months. I was wondering, some days are worse than others (mostly by the evening) and I’m wondering if anybody has any tips on how to keep her mind sharper and brighter. Prevent those nights where her mind seems to take a bigger dip. Have you done anything that you noticed made a big difference?

More games? Outdoors? Water consumption? Socialization?","The condition/agitation gets worse in the evening because she has symptoms of Sun Downers syndrome. She may believe she has to leave and put on a jacket or claim she has to go, get angry. Medications will help control her anxiety. You can use diversion/humour to smooth things over, to calm her down. Claim that she can leave in the morning, would you like some camomile tea with cookies?
Came here to say it sounds like Sun Downers. The thing that helped my mother the most was trying to keep the light levels in the house ""like daylight"" until we were ready for her to go to bed. The long shadows and low light levels are very confusing for the brain to process and cause a lot of symptoms to be magnified. Try turning on every light in the house BEFORE it starts to get dark so the light level never really changes.
This phenomenon is known as sundowning, and it is common.

I don't believe you can prevent it.  What you can do is structure events so that the decrease in cognitive ability is least problematical.  Maybe a favorite television show (not too close to bedtime), some soft music, a warm bath that you prepare.  No confusing social activities.  Be especially attentive against wandering, especially since searches are difficult after dark.
Yes to all of those but you can't prevent it.  You can only slow it.
This sounds a lot like sundowning. You can look up strategies to help, but it is fairly common. Sundowning can start in the afternoon and symptoms are increased agitation, anxiety, confusion and pacing.
sundowning is a very hard to manage. I do suggest an ALZ support group
Sundowners? Ugh. 
Never heard of it. Thank you so much for this. 
She’s also been under a lot of stress with a lawsuit against her (partner decided to split) and it’s making things worse.

And then you have the nice, calm, silent times like yesterday morning after they both had eaten their breakfasts.  Which was when my mother hit me with ""Did you pick me up by the head yesterday?""  I laughed way harder than I really should have.  Don't worry, I did not.   Hoping somebody else here gets a portion of the laughter I had.","The number of times my mom suddenly exclaimed ""don't eat me!"" was hilarious. The best was the time she said that and I replied with a chuckle ""don't worry I won't eat you"" and she sincerely replied ""thank you for that.""

It has its moments but it's still hard. Big hugs and hang in there.
Years ago, when my aunt was caring for her husband, she came into the room and he had two pair of pants on. When she asked my why he said, ""I have two legs don't I?"" That one still cracks me up!
We asked my brother, now living in a memory care unit, if he liked the chickens they had outside. ""Yup, I do. But I'd like 'em better if I ate 'em."" Deadpan delivery, a flash of his old sarcastic humor. I love those moments!
Yes - I ""LOL""ed.  Thanks.",2021-07-20 15:00:56,wlp71,oo8m5v
Alzheimers,Making Rounds with Oscar,"Someone I know just read this book, Making Rounds with Oscar, by Dr. David Dosa, a geriatric physician. She said that he recommends not treating other life threatening or severe illnesses, such as pneumonia, for Alzheimer’s patients. I’m probably misunderstanding her but she said that the doctor believes if you extend their life, you are only extending their misery. I feel like this shows no compassion. I have not read the book so I’m unsure if I’m misunderstanding what she is saying or if she is misunderstanding what the book is saying or if this information is accurate. Has any read this book? What was your take away?","My mom has late stage Alzheimer's and after treating her last bout of sepsis, we've decided not to treat any future infections or diseases that will inevitably crop up because her brain is failing. Her quality of life is bad and will only decline further and she'll be in more and more anguish and pain. The thing with Alzheimer's is that healing the body, doesn't heal the mind and the patient can't be ever ok especially in the late stage. So in a lot of cases, the compassionate thing to do is keep them pain free using meds like morphine and then let them pass away.
I haven't read the book. But some families choose to only make their family member comfortable when facing illness. 

My dad broke his hip, he has late stage Alzheimer's, because it was causing him pain we went ahead with the surgery. But our medical directive we filled out as a family we decided that comfort is the primary goal. It's a terminal disease so we aren't going to put him through unnecessary medical stuff.
You're not misunderstanding her.  It's been awhile since I read the book and well before I was a caregiver, but I remember appreciating it and recognizing how that actually is compassion.  Thanks for reminding me of this one. I need to read it again.
I have not read that book.  Have YOU read what end-stage Alzheimer's looks like?  It's not a pleasant way to die.
Never read the book, but my neighbor (and favorite teacher) had Alzheimer’s but ended up passing last year due to a stroke and a heart attack within two weeks. We just held his memorial service due to Covid restrictions, which was nearly a year after his passing.

I consider it a blessing. Why? Because this is what my Dad is going through right now. He is now severely impaired from Alzheimer’s/dementia due to a recent neuropsych evaluation.  We knew this was coming. His brother died last year from a stroke, and he was in a nursing facility for about two years.

This has been the long goodbye for several years. I’ve been preparing our kids in increments. Mom is his caregiver, but the awful truth is that they are both retired RNs. She has hit the exhaustion phase of caregiving. If he were to pass tomorrow, it would be a mixed blessing.",2021-07-20 07:58:11,pupjoint,oo0mft
Alzheimers,Grandma recently gone into care home and wants to leave,"Hi.

We've known my grandma has had dementia for about 2 years (probably longer) and recently she's gotten a lot worse. Leaving oil in the frying pan and not being able to smell it, falling and not using her alarm. She had carers come morning and night, but she got a leaflet through the post about a carehome and suggested it to my parents. 

She's been there 3 weeks and she's on a rolling 2 week stay at the moment to see how she likes it. Things seemed to be looking good, she's always kind of gloomy about things but when I last spoke to her a few days ago and I asked her how she was, she said 'oh, not so bad!' which is the best I've heard from her in a long, long time. She's stopped calling my parents in distress every day and she's been making friends and sitting outside. Stuff she never did at home. She would just sit there and sleep. 

But at the moment, there's a COVID case in her care home meaning no visitors and no AC during the UK's heatwave. She called my parents yesterday about not feeling fit enough to go to work and that she was worried about not going to work. She said she felt decrepit and useless. She has a recurring UTI that causes delirium, and the heat may be partly to blame for these thoughts, but she said it's too noisy and she can't cope much longer. My mum suggested that she get up and go to her own room if she wants a bit of peace, but she said she is so decrepit she can't even do that, so my mum changed the subject. At home she was depressed and lonely all the time and had started wandering outside sometimes, and wanted to go home when she lived there too. She's thinking about her old house. 

We can't force her to stay. But she can't live alone. Do you just keep telling them 'give it another week and see how you feel'? It feels so... Unethical. But allowing her to waste away in her house, living off icecream, potentially setting fire to the place is surely worse.","Yes I would keep saying something like “give it another week”. It might seem unethical but quite frankly you have to lie to Alzheimer’s patients pretty often. Say give it another week and then change the topic. It sounds like she’s a lot safer in the carehome than she would be by herself at home. Safety should be considered first. 


My mom wanted to go home for quite some time after we put her in a nursing home. It wasn’t safe for her to go though - she was just too far gone to really understand that. It’s gotten better and she’s gotten more comfortable as time has passed.
Wanting to ""go home"" is extremely common in Alzheimer's patients in a facility.  But a woman in my support group had an interesting variant on that.  Her husband kept wanting to go home, but he WAS at home!  She suspects he means the home he lived in as a child, not as a married adult.  Sad but funny  in a way, as long as it doesn't happen to you.",2021-07-20 04:25:24,helensis_,onxy6c
Alzheimers,I cannot continue to feel guilty all the time. I need an Off button for guilt!,"I was just sitting here, watching tv with my dogs, perfectly content and it occurred to me I could be at Mom's hanging out with her and I got this stab of guilt. But you know what? I just can't continue to feel guilty for everything I'm not doing for/with my mom. I do a lot every day and she has help, she's in the early stages now.  However, she also will suck every scrap of attention that I or anyone will give her. She's always been that way, but it's worse now.  I've spent my whole life stiff-arming my mother to keep her at a distance, but now I have to take care of her and I'm losing my hard won boundaries. It's so hard to figure out when it's the disease making her extra emotional or if she just wants my attention.  I just feel like an asshole all the time. All this would be much easier if we had a better relationship to begin with.","It is our responsibility to make sure they are safe, healthy, and pain-free. It is not up to us to make sure they are happy.
It's wise to recognize your negative feelings. Many people feel the same way, so don't be hard on yourself. Some people are just not emotionally suited for caregiving, whether because of strained childhood-based memories like yours that cause resentment, or personal temperament traits that are contrary to giving care (impatience, irritability, ""stunted compassion"", or other personality quirks). If you have feelings like resentment, you won't be able to provide the unconditional kind of care your loved one needs, even if you try to suppress or change your negative feelings in the name of duty or love.

For people who know they aren't the best fit for caregiving, the most responsible and loving alternative is to find exceptional outside help -- professional, experienced caregivers -- who can reliably and willingly step in to provide daily care. Placing a loved one in a facility that specializes in memory care or hiring an in-home professional caregiver are two of the most common alternatives. Other ways to provide relief for caregivers are using adult daycare centers and having relatives rotate a caregiving schedule.

Whichever solution you and your family decide upon, it's an act of love and not abandonment, as long as you stay involved, monitor the quality of care, and visit the patient often enough to maintain a personal connection. This ""connection"" is between you and the professional, not necessarily between you and the patient, because eventually s/he may not recognize who you are. The professionals you hire DO know who you are. Your presence and involvement encourage them to value the patient as someone's loved one rather than a task.
I am going through something very similar right now, and what I have learned is that if I don't maintain my boundaries it will eat me alive. They are on their journey and you have done your part.  Their negative and self absorbed outlook creates unhappiness that they have to own and you have every right to claim back as much of your time as you can: this can be a marathon unfortunately, so find your peaceful place and stick to it! Good luck...
Each sufferer of Alzheimer's brings their own personality to the disease.  My own patient (spouse) comes with a very cheerful, grateful, kindly personality.  Although it takes patience, he's a pleasure to care for.   I hear from other caregivers that their hyper-independent, hyper-critical and cranky family member is getting even worse in dementia.  

What I'm trying to say is, it's not YOUR fault what your MOTHER'S personality is.  It sounds like you are doing your best.  So just stop feeling bad.  Get as much help as you possibly can.  At some point, you are going to want to put her in facility care.  And that's reasonable.

Alzheimers,Incorrect Memories,"To make a long question short, does anybody know what causes incorrect memories?  I took my mother (who has Alzheimer's) to a doctor's appt.  The whole time we were out, she over and over again got real angry that my father made her this appointment and made me take her because he did not want to (none of it true).  I can wrap my head around the loss of memory and confusion, but these are just false memories.  I don't know what I am battling here.  Thanks.","A friend laid it out for me like this, when I saw something similar with my dad. She's trying to make a connect-the-dots picture, but is missing a bunch of dots. So, she's connecting the dots she has, and maybe a few that she'll grab from inputs like TV or Radio, and tries to make a picture out of that. As you've seen, that picture doesnt match reality.
The ""false memories"" are symptomatic of the loss of memory and confusion, you can't look at them as separate issues.

Your mother is just trying to make sense of the world around her, but now she struggles to collect, retain and use the necessary information.

So she unconsciously fills in all the gaps with something that seems to make sense to her, and holds on to that false information or memory. She has to, otherwise the world wouldn't make any sense, and you can imagine how frightening that would be.
This is a good explanation, and also tells why it's usually not a good idea to try to convince someone with dementia that their memory of something is wrong: https://teepasnow.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-unfounded-accusations-when-dementia-is-involved/
It’s likely [confabulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation). It’s very common in memory disorders and some brain injuries, and allows the person to sort of “fill in the gaps” of the things they don’t remember.
In case it helps i think the word for what you're describing is confabulation.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation
Theres some theory in there. 

It may help you to google the term with Alzheimer's or dementia to find link like what others provided. 

https://www.agingcare.com/Articles/How-to-handle-alzheimers-disease-lying-144204.htm

I also suggest finding a support group like with Alzheimer's association or similar. Many groups are now online.  The confabulation (among other Alzheimer's issues) can make you feel like you're going nuts yourself so its good to find a group and see and hear about others stories.
Thank you, both.  That does make sense.",2021-07-17 15:24:39,wlp71,omavcf
Alzheimers,What are the chances she will develop alzheimers?,I just found out that almost all of my girlfriends family on her mother's side had strokes and alzheimers. Everyone on her dads side has high blood pressure. She already deals with a few mental health issues like depression. If she starts to live a healthier lifestyle and get more sleep (she has super bad insomnia) can she save herself from it? She's in her earlier 20s...,"Bottom line per my mom's memory care doctor, everyone has a 50/50 chance by the time they reach the age of 80. Lifestyle changes may help, but there's no conclusive evidence it's a certainty. My mom was always at her ideal weight, walked a few miles every day, didn't drink excessively, never did drugs, and ate fish constantly, yet she ended up with it. My dad ate what he wanted, never exercised, and never had it, he ended up with cancer instead.
Be sure the depression doesn’t lead to social isolation as that can be a main contributing factor and in fact that and untreated anxiety are what they believe causes it for my mom. Exercise, healthy diet, avoiding stress…sure, they can all help. But, there are no guarantees either way.
Man,  you sure do expect a lot of guarantees!

By the time your 20-something girlfriend hits middle age, there's a good chance we will have a much better handle on preventing, if not curing, Alzheimer's.  If that's not assurance enough for you, find a bionic girlfriend.",2021-07-17 04:32:04,GojoPojo,om0ffo
Alzheimers,Transport to MC facility,"So it's time. Mom's paranoia and anger has gotten to the point where she can't stay home anymore - she's dangerous to herself and my father. Question - HOW did you get your LO to go into the AL/MC facility? She's aware enough to know exactly what is going to happen once we pull into the parking lot (my aunt was at the AL facility at the same location)? She's going to go in kicking and screaming - hopefully not literally - but any tips or suggestions are welcome.

&#x200B;

\*\*\* UPDATE\*\*\*

Kicking and screaming carried the day. We pulled in to just ""see a doctor here"" and she wasn't having it. She knew exactly where we were and had no intention of going inside. Started screaming, got out of the car, hit me when I started talking to her, and ended up inside with a couple of the nurses with Dad eventually to have coffee. We thought it was going better but she started yelling at everyone and got completely out of control. One of the nurses called it  psychotic episode-like behavior.The doctor there suggested a ride to the ER and placement in a geriatric psych ward so that's where we're at. It was one of the worst days of my life. My father was a champ, and as much as he loves my mother (to the moon and back), he stayed the course. She'll be there 7-10 days then go straight back to the MC facility.  I hate this disease SO MUCH.","With my mom, we said we had to stop in to see so-and-so and that we were bringing some goodies to her. When we walked in with the bag of things my mom loved, she was eager to have one of the chocolates. While she was sitting at a table eating her chocolate, the director asked her if she'd like a cup of coffee, something my mom loves, and she was more than happy to head off for that cup of coffee in the cafe area. As soon as she was out of sight, we left. The staff did a fantastic job from there telling her that we just had to run out to the car and would be right back. Mom didn't remember how long it had been, so she didn't put up too much of a fuss.
On mobile, formatting issue.
I don't know if this can be an option for you but
we just had to do this Wednesday with my mom. (Very similar situation that you described).
We contacted her primary care doctor and he filled out a physician certification form deeming non emergency transport as medically necessary. This is important because insurance will not pay for non emergency transport (Medicare). His office faxed that to the local EMS transport dispatch. They called me and set up a time to pick her up. When they arrived they told her the Dr wanted her to go get ""checked out"" because she hasn't been feeling well (all true statements). She was resistant at first but the paramedics were wonderful. They worked with her until she stood up by herself and sat on the stretcher by herself. This was in coordination with the memory care facility, they were ready for her on Wednesday.
My dad has power of attorney paperwork, however the paramedics said that as long as the memory care unit had the paperwork they did not need it.
I hope this helps you in some way. I'm so sorry you are going through this.
OP. I had to put my mother in a assisted living home 5 weeks ago and this week I had to transport mom to a geriatric memory behavioral home Monday night. This has been a unbelievable ride. Lawyers, cutting family off, moving mom and dealing with all of it. But the train left the station and we are along for ride.

Alzheimers,Dad almost certainly has dementia/Alzheimer's. Please read my story and give me advice.,"Illinois. Near Western Chicago Suburbs. My dad will be having an MRI on his brain July 26 and we will discuss the results with a neurologist July 29. I guess a quick first question is, will they tell us anything July 26?

Anyway, my dad had a traumatic brain injury in 1984 in a head on collision. In 2003 he was deemed permanently disabled due to that injury at age 46 so he has a background of brain injury. He is 65 now.

Well his memory has gotten worse but most of all he has been ""acting out."" He hasn't bathed in over 2 months. He took advantage of some dribbling issues he had where he got diapers and now just pees in them 24/7 and has since stopped changing his diapers regularly. He just lays in his pee soaked through his diaper through his pants and it stinks up the whole house as it flows through the air conditioner.

I guess he's manageable now though it's not fun. But one would say that soon he would need a home care aide or an adult day care specializing in memory care. I've read horror stories on reddit about how some patients even entering/in final stage Alzheimer's and are still being denied entry into nursing homes through Medicaid. Is this common?

If he gets really bad I think a nursing home would be preferable. His lifestyle is bedridden at the house. He doesn't get up ever. He just lays in his pee watching TV. Plus, the house is an absolute mess borderline hoarder house. I would feel absolutely horrid if a home care aide had to come into that. His room is just littered in junk and urine. I would love it if he could go to a adult day care for the remainder of his life and get some activity. However, the nearest one with memory care is 14 miles away and no one can drive him. I read on another thread that there might be programs that would be a few bucks to pay for his transportation but I bet it was a lot shorter distance than 28 miles each day. Does anyone know of any? My mom can't take care of him.

That's all I can think of for now. I'm really trying to do what I can with what I've got to keep my family afloat. I'm glad I found this thread.

Edit: As of about an hour after this post he is now pooping in his diapers per my mom...","I strongly recommend reaching out to departments on aging near you if you haven’t already. They are a great resource to figure out next steps and what’s available.
Contact your local Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC).  They will be the most accurate source of information for your locality.

It's really difficult to say what's going on with him, if his brain injury was so bad he got total disability at age 46.

I don't see him as a candidate for adult day care, if he is incontinent which just creates an unsatisfactory situation for everyone.  He sounds like more a candidate for memory care or nursing home care, residential.  By the way if he is in dirty diapers for any length of time at all he is at risk of infections himself, so any situation where they can handle that should be an improvement.

Try to form an alliance with your mother so you both are on the same page.  Good luck.
Unfortunately the MRI does not tell everything. My Mrs had the MRI which showed normal. 

Just had a SPECT plys CT Scan with a PET scan to follow. These are nuclear medicine scans where radioactive trace elements are injectecd into the bloodstream and the brain activity scanned.

These scans will show how much brain activity and where in the brain the impairm eent is occuring.

Our specialist has more or less confirmed dementia. These further will add weight to the diagnosis.


I am not optimistic. Wifev is 71. I'm 59 going on 60 (yes she was the original cougar) so she will have a carer.
It would also be worth hiring an elder care attorney if you can. If he's on Medicaid right now, great. If he's not, it's worth noting that when you do a spend down there is a five year look back and many facilities that accept Medicaid have waitlists that can be years long.",2021-07-16 12:48:00,Dangerous-Handle-280,olkrlf
Alzheimers,Dementia elder abuse at Yelp,"Just want every care taker to know that Yelp will keep images of dementia people who had their picture taken at business without their consent. 

Back story- I found a negative review of my moms biz and in the review there is a photo of my dad suffering from late stage dementia. I kid you not. He is standing tall and looking at the camera. He was not wandering. But he sure as hell did not and could not give consent. 

I reported this reviewer and review but Yelp will not take it down. 

It’s elder abuse and disgusting. He has since passed away and I am doing everything I can to remove this review.","I’m really sorry that you are going through that. I’m also sorry for the loss of your loved one. I can imagine how frustrating and angry it would make me. I would say keep at it. Send emails and calls. Maybe consider reaching out to the individual who posted the review directly if possible? I know that if I had no idea of a persons situation and then posted a bad review , then that persons family member explained the situation, I would be willing to take down my review. Or at least change it accordingly. I understand that your loved one passed away recently snd it hurts to think that this negative statement and review about them is out there in the world on the internet snd it feels like putting salt on a wound. I really am sorry snd just know that someone out there understands at least a little bit what you are going through.  Sending a hug*

Edit: I just read what I wrote and please know that I mean no disrespect and I’m not trying to egg you on to pursue this poster of the review. If you feel like it would bring you more peace to just walk away that is very understandable too. Just wanted to say that :)
Look into privacy laws in your state, regarding photography and video recordings in public/private/etc places. It’s possible that these laws may not just protect you but could also protect that person’s image of your dad. 

Outside of that, I’d try to reach out to the reviewer and work it out with them cordially.
This is lawsuit territory.  Get an attorney.  Go for damages.
You say a business… is this considered “in public?” Or is this some sort of healthcare facility? In general, if someone is in public, there is no expectation of privacy (ala surveillance cameras) and your photo can be taken without consent. That includes children, the disabled, and the elderly. However sometimes with websites and such, if you request a photo of yourself (or one you have the copyright to) be removed, they will comply as courtesy. 

If it’s a healthcare facility in a patient care area then hipaa laws would apply and photos would not be allowed. There are court cases you can Google re photos in public",2021-07-15 19:19:11,,ol4fd2
Alzheimers,Desperately looking for advice for my parents,"Hello Reddit. Towards the beginning of 2021 my elderly step father had a sudden violent mental episode which led to a diagnosis of Alzheimer's.  The hospital sent him to a psychiatric facility to recover and then to our local nursing home for rehab. He has Tri-Care insurance and medicare which covers 100 days in a nursing home after a medical problem. During this time my mother has worked with the nursing homes insurance bookkeeper to get him qualified for Medicaid. He financially qualifies, but even after an appeal they claim he doesn’t qualify medically. They say he doesn’t even qualify for at home nursing help. 

This is extremely upsetting as there is no way he can go back home and no way my parents can afford the $6000/month nursing home. He can not take care of himself at all and my mother has serious health problems and can not take care of him either. There is no one else able to care for him. He has military training and got so violent in the hospital it took five people to hold him down and put him in restraints. Knowing this there is no way I could allow him to live with my mother or her pets. At the moment his is staying in the hospital because of a sudden serious health problem, but if he does recover there are only 20 days left of nursing home care covered by his insurance. His Alzheimer's is very serious and  he can’t recognize his own children, thinks his wife is his mother, and has no idea where he is or what is going on. It’s even worse now, because the medication he was on to help with his memory caused extreme side effects that almost killed him. 

We honestly have no idea what to do and my step father never prepared for the future. If he passes my mother can’t even pay their mortgage and would have to sell the house. Should we look into hiring a lawyer? There is a long-term care facility for veterans near us, but I have no idea if they would accept him or how we could pay for that. This situation feels extremely hopeless and we are looking for any advice possible.

Infot:

He is in his mid 80’s

He is a veteran and served in the Vietnam and Korean war

He can do nothing on his own","He should be working with the VA system for healthcare. 

I'm not sure what a lawyer can do for you on the mortgage... Do they really not have any money saved to cover this? You might need to sell the house and try to find her cheaper housing. You could apply for housing assistance for this to defray some costs.
It's crazy he is not qualifying--has he seen a neurologist and gotten an official diagnosis of dementia? 

An estate planner or a ""document prep company"" can help you make a trust for your mother's assets--this is the way to avoid his costs/debts affecting her, though she will still need to pay the mortgage somehow. He should have VA benefits that cover everything though.
okay - so I went to NAMI who don't deal directly with Alzheimers, but did write a really handy reference of organizations to contact: [https://helplinefaqs.nami.org/article/106-my-family-member-has-alzheimer-s-dementia-how-do-i-find-them-care](https://helplinefaqs.nami.org/article/106-my-family-member-has-alzheimer-s-dementia-how-do-i-find-them-care)  


Find a good advocacy org, that's your next step in my opinion. I'm so sorry you're going through this.
Look for Aid and Attendance with the VA. That said, the backlog seems to be tremendous for that. We filed three years ago, and the pandemic really messed things up. We were bounced from one specialist to another and after the fourth, they stopped communicating with us at all. We never did get funds.

Also for Medicaid, the time of the month when you apply can make a difference. You want to pay off all monthly bills first and then apply for the month with the income that remains. That's something the eldercare lawyer we have told us to make sure we're doing. Even $1 too much in an account is enough to get your application denied.
Check with the VA immediately. How are the VA nursing homes in your area? An advocate or lawyer specializing in elder law might be a better choice for working with Medicaid/VA. If he’s being violent, then he’s a danger to himself and other people. He DOES qualify under those circumstances. Tell his docs and get him re-assessed. 

Having said that, some facilities won’t except people who are physically violent. I’m having the same issues with my mother right now, and she’s not nearly as bad as your dad. We finally found a place that will except her with her occasional issues, and has Medicaid beds for her to transfer to win the trust fund we have for her runs out. 

Stay at it. Form a support team for yourself. Get his doctors on board, an advocate or lawyer, A social worker, and you. get the doctors to explain his condition, and the outbursts being part of it as clearly as possible. He definitely does qualify for aid, because of them.
I feel like you wrote this from my brain!! My Dad a retired Navy guy has the same issue angry outbursts and super strong! He retired in the late 80s. Back then they didn't make the VA things mandatory when they were getting out or retiring so my Dad has no VA rating. If any Vet has a rating over 70% they qualify for a VA Home at no charge. Unlike you my parents have a large estate not super large but enough to want to pass down however it looks like the government is going to take everything if we place him in home. Your first step should be to contact a local VFW in their area and as to speak to their VSO from there go directly to the VA Clinic in their town.
In home healthcare is covered for specific issues in my state with Medicare. I’m not saying that because of that, it’s the same where you live. I’m only suggesting that certain aspects of IHHC might be covered where others aren’t. It’s something that has to be referred by their doctor here and what is covered here is nursing, physical therapy, and a few visits for speak/swallowing therapy. Maybe check and see if any categories are covered. So sorry for your situation and bless you, you are added to my prayers.",2021-07-14 19:40:04,Spoopaloops,okgmxw
Alzheimers,Looking for some advice for my grandfather.,"Hi everyone. I wasn't sure where else to post this, but I'm looking for some advice for my grandfather. He has Alzheimer's and whenever he wakes up, either from a nap or sleeping overnight, he says the same thing. ""Where is my wife?"" and ""I want to go back to New Jersey"". He lived in New Jersey 30 years ago before we moved here. He lives with his wife (my grandmother, who is taking care of him) and he will tell her ""I want to see my wife"" and she always insists on telling him that she ***is*** his wife. This confuses him to the point where he threatens to call the police. After a while, he eventually calms down and realizes where he is. I'd just like to know what we could do to possibly calm him down so he doesn't freak out when he wakes up since that when the majority of the confusion happens. My grandmother isn't in the best health either and I want to make sure she doesn't escalate things (she can be pretty impatient with him) because she gets really frustrated when he doesn't know who she is. Any help is immensely appreciated. Thank you.

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow. I am blown away with all the support and advice. I am grateful for everyone here. Thank you reddit!","If she could join a caregivers support group, she would learn that these kinds of yearnings and misrepresentations of reality are extremely common in Alzheimer's, and she could get her feelings of hurt and frustration validated.  So I recommend that.  You might check with the Alzheimer's association and senior centers in your area, usually there are many of these groups in every city.  

One of the recommendations is compassionate lying.  If he wants to go home to New Jersey, tell him we'll be going day after tomorrow.  Of course by day after tomorrow he'll likely forget the whole conversation.   And when he doesn't recognize your grandmother as his wife, she could ask ""What's your wife's name?"" or say ""Your wife is at the beauty salon, she'll be back in three hours.""

And instead of arguing the facts of a situation, it is recommended to redirect him.  If he's grumpy or frustrated, offer some ice cream!  Or tell him you need help with the laundry, could he fold some towels please?  (You can have a basket of these just for this purpose.)

These are techniques I learned from the support group I attend.
In the moment, when he asks for his wife maybe just say ""she ran to the store"" and as for the New Jersey thing say ""we'll go there soon."" Then you can deflect with something else like ""what shirt should we wear today?"" It's best to keep them calm rather than give them facts. I know this is hard for your grandmother, but it's something she's going to have to get used to as its not going to get better.
In his mind he's probably visualizing his wife as a young woman, not an elderly woman, because his reality is stuck in the past. He doesn't recognize her now. Instead of continually explaining and correcting him, it helps to play along and agree with his reality for a while (especially when he just woke up or when he's tired/stressed).

It's okay to tell a white lie to calm him and avoid any distress or confrontation. It's not necessary to correct  him, even though we think he surely would want us to. Our normal brains recognize reality, we remember facts about ourselves & loved ones, and we think logically. We mistakenly believe our Alzheimer's loved one must be unhappy if they can't think normally, or that they must be upset when they're confused -- actually, they don't know they're confused unless we keep correcting them. They're living in the moment and just need kindhearted guides to help them through it.

I agree with u/Reichiroo and u/UnsightlyFuzz  that deflection, diversion, and distraction are useful techniques:

* ""Where's my wife?""""She went to the store, and she'll be back in a while. Let's get a snack!""  (Even your grandmother can answer as if ""his wife"" is someone else. It's difficult, but don't take it personally when you're not recognized.)
* ""I want to go to New Jersey.""""Ahh, New Jersey!  You had good times there, didn't you? I think I've seen pictures of the house where you lived."" ... OR ...
* ""We'll go to New Jersey soon. How would you like to go outside and sit in the garden?"" (or whatever he enjoys)

Just as we do with children, it's best to redirect, distract, and keep dementia patients calm. In other words, sometimes you need to ""be kind and lie.""  Play along with his reality if it isn't causing any harm -- and best of all, distract with a favorite activity, snack, or music (whatever works) to get his mind off his question or fixation.

Check out videos by **Teepa Snow**. She has really helpful advice and gives lots of examples. 

* In [this video](https://youtu.be/dmPQLf9IUNI?t=101) she explains patients' perception of reality (that they still think of themselves as they were in the past). 
* And in [this video](https://youtu.be/gCAAy53cZDQ), she demonstrates some techniques for interacting with an Alzheimer's patient so that they feel secure.
Have you talked about meds with his neurologist or primary care doc? A low dose of something at this point might really be helpful.
My father would call my mother on the phone with her Sitting right in Front of him. When she would pick up the phone he was utterly disappointed and unconvinced.

Some time redirection works, some time it doesn't. With my father it never really worked.

This illness has to be treated, mostly, with a well-targeted anti-psicotic and sedation for the Times they get aggressive.

It is better for them, if they are delirant and aggressive, and everyone else to be in a permanent semi-sedated state.
You learn to lie a lot. My dad died years ago, and my mom asks where he is. We'll say he's gone out and will be back soon. She forgets and asks again later and we just keep responding that way. Distractions do also help. My mom's slipped into the final stage now, but I used to have a struggle to get her to go back inside her memory care community after we'd gone out for lunch. I'd walk her the bakery nearby and let her pick out some goodies. I encouraged things like tiramisu, mousse, or eclairs that had to be refrigerated, and that always worked. She'd be in a rush to get it back to her apartment before it started melting.",2021-07-14 13:18:56,NotARespawnEmployee,ok907g
Alzheimers,Help with sun downing/ wandering?,"Hello, my dad with Alzheimer’s gets confused very late at night and tries to leave the house, looking for his mom (who passed away). When my brother or I try to stop him, he starts being aggressive and yells.","You need a solution with locks he cannot open, and you probably should also have the doors and windows alarmed to wake the house if he somehow gets out.

The wandering is probably more dangerous in winter, because they can easily become hypothermic and freeze to death.

It's wise to avoid confronting him, which triggers his aggression.  Keep voices soft and try to convince or redirect, rather than force.
You have to change the locks to lock from the inside. Many families do this---just make sure you keep the old knobs and change everything back once he is gone because ultimately it's dangerous to be locked-in but more dangerous for people with dementia to wander.",2021-07-14 10:23:31,yayfatcakes3,ok5e8d
Alzheimers,Any signs to look out for with someone as Alzheimer’s progresses?,"My dad (55ish) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s a while back, maybe a half a year or more. I (16) have mostly been left out of the loop in regards to his treatments, what stage he is in, etc. What I’m wondering is if there’s anything in particular that I should look out for as the disease progresses. At the moment my father is kinda independent as he takes care of the animals, drives me places if their not too far, goes shopping by himself sometimes and just last week for example he helped me install an ac unit in my room. In regards to his Alzheimer’s, the only major thing I noticed is him telling me the same joke or story over and over or him forgetting to grab things as he leaves. That being said, I do know that things won’t be like this forever and I’m simply wondering if there are any key things or signs that you guys have noticed as the disease progresses from personal experience that I should look out. I mostly want to know since I can “gauge” how much he is affected and so I can know when to take more responsibility in the household per say if that makes sense. Thanks in advance for any tips","The biggest thing I noticed when things starting going downhill was how often my mom would get lost doing basic things that she had always done. She couldn’t find her way to the grocery store or find her way home. Trips that were 20 minutes could last 2 hours. After that it was a pretty quick decline. 

My biggest piece of advice right now is to spend as much time with him as possible. Take pictures, record his voice, take videos of him talking or something. I hate to say it but it really will just get worse and more frustrating as time goes on. I have felt every emotion across the board while dealing with my mom and often I feel those emotions within like an hour. 

My mom is at the point now where we cannot do things together. She’s in a nursing home and does not recognize me as her daughter. She is quite mean to me and I do not visit her often because of the awful things she says.I’ll call her but will not do an in person visit especially if I’m alone with her. I wish I had more pictures and videos with her to remember her by.
A couple of thoughts.  Each person's decline will be different.  If you spend a lot of time with your Dad you will begin to notice differences.  I agree with others that forgetting how to do things he routinely does could be something that changes.  I noticed strange entries in her check book.  She could no longer balance her checkbook.  I noticed that her writing of a note or a list didn't make sense. He may start reaching for words of basic items.  He may describe the 'thing' rather than recall the 'name' of the thing. The phases of the disease are typically defined on a scale through your Dad's neurologist/doctor visits.  They give him a series of tasks and depending on what he scores they place him in a category.  When I've asked what should I expect I'm told she won't get any better however she could stay in the stage she is currently in for a very long time. That has been true for my Mom.  Weirdly, during her last geriatrician visit she scored so high that she was placed in mild dementia when she's been in moderate for a couple of years now.  

Learning how to enjoy your Dad as the illness progresses is important.  Someone commented that you should take videos of him.  I agree.  One piece of advice I would offer you too is that at your age you may not be interested in your family's history, however, I would encourage you to ask you Dad about his childhood, about his Mom and Dad, about his experiences because by the time you are old enough to want to know the answers to these questions he won't be able to tell you.  Video tape this if it's appropriate.  I've been video taping my Mom making family recipes and she tells me what she's doing as she does it.  Many years from now her grandchildren will know how to make ravioli and how to make her famous meatballs.  So much of this family history gets lost if someone isn't recording it.

Sending hugs your way.  You sound like a wonderful child.
I found it was important to be prepared for him forgetting people close to him. My father began to not recognize my mother and instead wondered where the girl he dated in high school was. I've carefully explained to him that it's the same person 1000 times (literally), but he always forgets or fails to grasp the concept. He also routinely asks about 'the woman' now living in the house. You can google facial agnosia, which may help you understand what is going on. My biggest contribution has been not judging him and treating his questions as legitimate. He's found a solid trust in me, and though it can be taxing on my own time and mental health, I'm young enough to endure it. Be prepared to exercise your patience to their end - it's a tough disease. Remember what your father did for you and help him in his time of need. Good luck, friend
My thought are that you will see a reduced level of complexity in your dad. His ability to handle daily tasks will deteriorate. My SO forgot how to wash her hair. I took her through the process step by step and she hasn't had the problem again. But she will forget something else in the near future. 

She has trouble finding things she that she lost. 

She repeatedly says, ""I don't understand.""

I try to visit familiar places with her, rather than give her new experiences. 

Your father's condition will follow its own unique path. 

Different parts of the brain are affected in different levels and sequence. 

Advice: Don't sweat the small stuff.

Make suggestions rather than try to tell your father what he should do. Give your suggestion time to seep into dad's mind. 

Good luck!
\[apologies for the lengthiness; take what you need and leave the rest!\]

My strongest recommendation for you is to educate yourself about Alzheimer's (check out [Teepa Snow's videos](https://teepasnow.com/resources/about-dementia/); she's an expert in caring for Alzheimer's patients -- but keep in mind, your dad may still be in the very early stages and probably not as debilitated as advanced Alzheimer's patients). 

Another strong recommendation is to make sure a responsible person in the family hires an Elder Law attorney who knows the ins and outs of legal affairs in this type of situation and can guide your family in protecting your dad's assets and rights. This will probably include taking over the financial duties for him. Elder Law attorneys know much more about the unique issues than general attorneys do, including SS benefits, Medicare/Medicaid, hospitalization, etc. They also have a network of connections regarding care and legal/financial help.

Don't be afraid of the ""weirdness"" you'll see in your dad. Find the humor and allow him to be different than he used to be, but always remembering his best qualities!  When he doesn't make sense, or when he insists that something is different than reality, simply play along and don't try to reason with him or argue. For example, if he asks about his old girlfriend, simply say, ""We'll see her soon,"" or ""She said she'll call next Tuesday,"" or whatever. Such compassionate dishonesty is allowed as a calming device, because the truth is not always useful and often upsetting. Instead of saying, ""But we live in Idaho; you can't go back to Houston anymore,"" just say, ""We're checking out times to go to Houston next month. Let's get some ice cream now."" Avoid correcting or arguing with him as much as you an, because he won't remember the facts later and your impatience will upset him.  

Divert, distract, and redirect whenever possible, just as a gentle parent would do with an overactive toddler. 

We noticed my brother's decline more or less in this order: 

1. ""Repeating"" -- repeating the same stories, asking the same question several times.
2. ""Dropping the thread"" --  losing his train of thought (starting a sentence and not finishing it; starting a story and not remembering how it ends); inability to find words; inability to name objects or understand which object is being referred to.
3. ""Drifting attention"" -- dropping out of conversations; hanging back and not participating in conversations (after a lifetime of being the extroverted center of attention). 
4. ""Freezing"" -- being unable to remember how to do something and freezing in position; for example, during a family buffet dinner, he stood frozen in place with a plate in hand, not remembering how to load it with food. He also didn't know how to ask for help.
5. ""Lost skills"" --  He started having difficulty operating his computer but he had always been relatively computer literate.  He also became electronically illiterate and couldn't operate any appliances or products that required button-pushing. He could no longer remember how to warm up coffee in the microwave, start the dishwasher, or operate any remotes. We even had to reteach him how to use a light switch, because he froze at each one. Fortunately, he gave up driving early on without protest (probably he forgot how to drive) and never showed further interest in the car.
6. ""Computer Issues"" -- Password maintenance became impossible. He started getting locked out of accounts, requiring him to change passwords frequently. Then he would forget them or have a zillion of them written on random sticky notes or scraps. Eventually, he couldn't remember his email address or familiar web addresses, or even how to open a browser on the PC. He lost interest and finally stopped trying -- no more computer use.
7. ""Who ya gonna call?"" -- Smart phones, which he used when he was first diagnosed, quickly became too confusing for him to operate; his wife bought a simple flip phone and he couldn't retain enough to learn how to use it.  He could answer a landline phone but didn't know how to carry on a conversation (he must have been like a [""Lenny""](https://lennytroll.com) to telemarketers, confusing them). My SIL often had to intervene and hang up.
8. ""Financial illiteracy"" -- Writing checks that (shockingly) made it through transactions saying only ""today"" for the date; ultimately, he was unable to write out numbers at all. Balancing a checkbook or monitoring accounts became impossible, but my SIL didn't notice the mistakes and mishaps until the mess was huge. (Tip: Take over the finances or at least get added to their accounts so you can monitor & correct mistakes!)
9. ""Overstocked Inventory"" -- When he was still driving and using credit cards and checks, he often bought irrational items or things he had already purchased. He bought golf balls but hadn't ever played golf or expressed any interest in it. At one time there were SIX 50-lb bags of dog food in the garage (for a cocker spaniel).
10. ""Repeated behavior"" -- he picked apples nonstop from a grove of trees on his poperty, stuffing his pockets full and bringing bucket after bucket to the house. My SIL tossed most of the apples in the far woods repeatedly and used the best apples to make (many) pies and cobblers. He was always surprised to see the buckets on the porch that he had already filled, as if someone else was doing it. He also enjoyed folding towels, over and over again.
11. ""Geographic blindness"" -- inability to know where he was or how to go to a specific place. Telling him to go the bedroom required pointing to the actual room or leading him to it. He no longer could say his street address or even his city or state. He would wander around outside and get disoriented or lost.
12. ""Possession Obsessions"" -- He had always loved jackets (LL Bean addict) and began spending a lot of time taking them out of the closet and spreading them on a railing and showing them to us. He would say, ""Look! Look at that! Isn't that one great?"" and say the same thing about the same jacket 40 seconds later. He also liked putting them on (sometimes in several layers, even in hot weather). He also pulled folded clothes out of drawers and spread them on beds and chairs to admire them. SIL put clothes away several times a day!
13. ""Shadowing"" -- He became clingy and would not stay alone longer than a few minutes. He began hanging near us and needing constant attention, following my SIL or me around and asking what we were doing.  There came a time when we couldn't go to the bathroom without him worrying that we disappeared (he couldn't remember that we said we were going to the John); he'd be in the next room calling for us or just saying, 'Hey! Where is everybody? Hey there!""
14. ""Instruction Malfunction"" -- He couldn't follow directions, especially a series of instructions. ""Your coffee is on the table by your chair"" was impossible for him to understand. We had to point to the chair while saying, ""Sit down in your chair."" Then, point to the cup or hand it to him, saying,  ""Here's your coffee."" and after he was holding the cup, saying ""Now drink your coffee.""  Breaking up instructions that way helped him, but it was energy-draining for us!
15. He was unable to follow TV programs or movies, especially the news. He would keep asking ""Who is THAT person?"" about the newscaster and ""Why is he talking? What is he talking about?"" Sitcoms were easier for him to follow, but still confusing. He was aware enough to comment on famous / infamous people (for example, when he saw Trump on the TV, he cursed at him). But if you asked him who was the president or what year it was, my brother couldn't tell you.

These were the early- to mid-stage patterns we saw develop, and my brother grew increasingly unable to function without constant assistance. Eventually, he had many out-of-bathroom experiences and his wandering into woods increased the danger of getting lost or suffering physical injury. That was the final push for my SIL and she found a well-vetted memory care unit where he was welcomed and where he has settled in without any reluctance or complaints.",2021-07-14 01:24:58,Turnover_Ordinary,ojxms2
Alzheimers,My MIL may soon need to live closer to us. She's on public benefits. I made a list of questions to ask her case manager. Can someone who has been through this before tell me what questions I'm missing?,"My husband is in denial when it comes to his mother's declining health. She is increasingly paranoid, blaming her home care attendants for everything from stealing from her (they aren't) to trying to kill her (if her food is even slightly spicy). Her health really took a turn over the last year due to severe isolation (due to COVID - she's in NYC where everything was shut down). My husband will procrastinate so I am trying to take a proactive role in getting her ready to be moved from NY to FL now, that way everything is lined up when we actually need to do it. 

My proposed questions for him to ask her case manager are below. Are there other questions I should be asking?

Make sure you ask specifically if Medicaid dementia facilities/care homes have wait lists or requirements to get in.

Plus, many would not allow her to switch from private pay to Medicaid unless she'd already been a private pay resident for a minimum of two years. She ended up in NY when her aggression worsened.

Alzheimers,My dad with Alzheimer’s finished his 200 piece puzzle today! Took him around 4 hours,,"Lovely!  My mother loved puzzles. She worked her way from 500 pieces to 2 pieces in the last two years. Now she folds washcloths in half or looks at photos of her parents or picture books. It’s a sad disease.

That's awesome 😊
Oh my.....wonderful!    Can I make a suggesting?   there is a type of puzzle that has three different sized pieces in the box.    They are a 'family' size type of puzzle.  I work in retail, and we sell these puzzles, and a woman once came in and requested we get more because the Alzheimer society had suggested that they are good puzzles for patients - the different sizes involve different parts of the brain and different dexterity.     Not sure if I am allowed to give brands here, but you can pm if you would like that information.
Give the man a reward!
I could never get my spouse to do crosswood puzzles.  We would both enjoy jigsaw puzzles, but we have active and mischievous cats who knock the pieces every which way.

Alzheimers,Needing to vent about my Grandpa,"My grandpa has had Alzheimer’s for a few years now. He is in the late stages where he can barely speak, is bed ridden, and barely eats.

It has gotten really bad and it’s just devastating in every way imaginable. I’m only 19 so I’ve never experienced anything like this before. It’s so painful and this whole situation makes me cry so much. I love my grandpa and I’ve been visiting him as much as I can. I don’t really know what the point of this post is, I just wanted to vent to people who I know have also dealt with what I’m feeling. Alzheimer’s is an evil, cruel, and awful disease.","*big hugs* hang in there.
I'm so sorry. Alzheimer's is a terrible and ugly disease.
My heart goes out to you. I was finally able to visit my mom for the first time since they had to move her out of state due to the lack of 24/7 skilled nursing care in my state. 

I was heartbroken to find she's in a wheelchair now, she doesn't stand or walk on her own, and she barely speaks - just words of nonsense here and there. She's also barely eating and is only sipping at protein shakes. I get the pain you're in. It sucks!
I'm so sorry that you're dealing with this, especially at your age. Try to remember that your grandfather was once a strong man who surely contributed meaningfully to a lot to other people's lives.

Alzheimers,I'm just overwhelmed.,"I'm 35 and my mom will be 71 in August. My dad died when I was in high school. Both myself and my sibling live several hours away. How can we care for her?

I'm not sure how I'm going to handle all of this. I'm terrified my mom could get awful care unless I supplement with my own income, but at such a young age I just don't have any money.","First thing,, see a Elder Care attorney. They will be able to help you through this.
Reach out to aging centers near you - they should be able to help you find resources and sort of walk you through step by step the process to become POA and stuff (which you should do sooner than later). Where do you live? In maine, USA my mom ended up on mainecare because she didn’t have money or assets. My siblings and are also poor af and had no way to pay for her care. It was a process to get on mainecare but once again the aging center really helped us figure out the steps we needed to take. There was a lot of paperwork involved and I wish we had done it sooner than we did.
I agree with all the advice seen so far on this thread - support group, eldercare attorney, aging resource center, Medicaid.  You shouldn't have to put much of your own money into her care, but travel and incidentals could add up.  Take this one step at a time, and ask your sibling to get involved too.  Too often we see one sibling take action and then the others just sit back and criticize!
One of the best things I ever did was join a support group. You will not only meet people on your same journey, but they will help and provide ideas, tips, and direction that will be a lifesaver. Know that I am thinking of you and hope for the very best. Take care and always remember that you can’t change the direction of the wind, but you can adjust the sails.
There’s a document on the aarp website called “prepare to care.” It’s a great place to start.
Like everyone here is saying, elder care lawyer but if you feel overwhelmed you can also call (or visit) ALZ.org
Can you set up wi-fi cameras in your mom’s house? I got our on Amazon for about 25$ each - they are YI home I can hear what’s going on and even talk to my mom if need be. Some home health aides don’t like them and those are the kind you don’t want.",2021-07-11 00:51:05,leadvocat,ohy33w
Alzheimers,Groundhog Day,This is a shit post. Mom(71) with AZ and she calls me 3-7 times every day. Asking where my dad is. He died 5 months ago. So I’m basically living  in this Groundhog Day hell of letting my mom know every day her husband of 50 years died 5 months ago. I just need to vent. I love this sub because I’ve learned so much.,"That sounds really emotionally draining to have that conversation multiple times every day. Can you tell her he's ""out"" for some reason?
When my mom asks I can tell by the way she phrases it whether or not she knows. “My brothers died, right?” Gets the answer “yes, but I am here and I will take care of you” with a hug. “Where are my brothers” calls for the answer “In _____, they never cam to the US, but I am here to take care of you”. Either answer is followed by a hug. I see it as the underlying feeling is the same where are the people in my family that I need to take care of or that need to take care of me?
Don't keep telling her he died.  Tell her a different lie each time.  One time it is ""he's in hospital for tests,"" another time it might be ""he is out of town visiting his mother"" or ""he's been on jury duty but should be done soon.""

Compassionate lying is a key tool in the toolbox of a dementia caregiver.
It’s OK to lie to her and tell her he’s doing groceries or something. It’s much better than having her relive that fresh grief every day.
[deleted]
Just tell her he's gone out for groceries and will be back in a bit. That's we do in memory care facilities
My mom does that. I tell her dad went to get them ice cream cones and is going to take her for a walk afterward. She smiles and it cheers her up every time. 

Until she asks again 5 minutes later, of course. 

I must admit I had not considered the alternative approach, “no ice cream for you - he’s dead”. I’ll give that some thought.
Master the art of distraction.
Thanks all for the suggestions. I’ve tried to do the “he’s out doing yada yada”, or he’s on a work trip, etc, but as I mentioned above, it’s more like she knows he is gone, but wants me to confirm it because she doesn’t remember the actual event of his passing even though she was with him. That’s what makes it so hard. I try to lie and skirt and change the subject but it doesn’t work.",2021-07-10 19:08:23,spraypaintR19,oht0lb
Alzheimers,suicidal comments,"hey everyone, i’m 21 and am living at home for the summer with my Mom who is 63 and has early onset. she also has a few other health issues and is currently in a boot for a broken foot. oftentimes she goes on tangents about how damaged of a person she is, how she has so many ailments in her life, and wants to put herself out of her misery. her punch line “pain is my best friend.” i have no idea how to respond to these comments, so i stay silent and let her ramble. it makes me so sad. i’m wondering how anyone here copes with hearing this rhetoric from those you know affected, if at all?","I’m really sorry you’re going through that - that’s really rough and hard to deal with. My mom who also has early onset went through a very similar phase a few years back. I’m sure other people might have better ideas but the only thing that worked for me was saying “I’m sorry mom, I know things feel rough right now and I’m here for you” and then redirect and change the topic of conversation. This phase lasted like 4-6 months and even very occasionally will still randomly come out (thought it really was a conversation she’d have with me every hour so it’s not nearly as bad anymore).
I agree with the earlier poster that this is a phase. Unfortunately this might be the last phase in which the person is fairly aware of what is happening to them. It’s scary. My grandfather used to just say “i’m losing my mind” quite often and there was nothing to say.

What i wish I knew at that time is this is the time to really tell them how much you loved them, print photos and show them your favorite memories together, remind them of the ways in which they helped your life in small or big ways. These can be really helpful in bringing some happiness to their minds. Also redirecting when all else fails seems to work. With his alzheimer’s my grandad developed an obsession with the weather, watching it, checking the temperature, looking at the clouds etc so it was always a good redirection to go check the weather with him. I’m not sure if there is something your mom fixated on, or if this was just a him thing, but finding something that will interest them is key.

This will pass on to the more intense phase in which they will become unaware of the change and adjust to their new “mindset”.
Yes, that's a reasonable attitude to take when a person finds themselves in such devastating circumstances.

There are things you can do to help her feel better.  Get a consult with a geriatrics psychiatrist to see if she can be prescribed an antidepressant, and see a talk therapist to talk over her issues.  See about getting her some massage therapy, which makes most people feel better.  Try to get her to a senior center for social contact.  Help her do some exercise; since her foot is injured, perhaps yoga or chair exercise might be helpful.  Speak kindly to her; try to get her some of her favorite foods; maybe a trip to a beauty salon or day spa would feel good to her.  Put on some music she enjoys.  All the things that make most of us feel cheerful, from a comedy movie to fresh flowers to a sunny day, you can try to provide for her.

As for your own feelings, either go to a dementia caregiver support group, or at least go to individual therapy.  (I do both.)  You naturally feel sad, not only for your mother's sadness but for your own loss of the mother you knew.  Bottling those feelings up will not help you cope with them.
Is she on mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and/or anti anxiety medications? Not saying drugs are a fix all, but they definitely can help to sooth her anxiety and treat her depression. The mood stabilizers can help to control severe swings. Getting her comfortable and potentially at peace will only make things better and easier for the both of you. 

Distraction from negative feelings by talking about her favorite stories or things is helpful, as is playing music she enjoys, looking through photos, or playing easy board games. This phase won’t last forever. 

My grandmother has always had a very pessimistic view of life, but as she deteriorates; she is easier going. She accepts things without arguing much more and is more grateful for the companionship. While I know it’s not her usual behavior, it’s like a silver lining in a way. I hate to know why she’s more amiable and agreeable, but god works in mysterious ways they say.
All I can offer is to hang in there. My mom has made comments about suicide for most of the 11 years she's had Alzheimer's. I finally was able to visit yesterday since she was moved out of state. She's advanced to the late stages now and it was the first time I've visited her without hearing it. I'd rather have heard it though as she had no idea who I was and barely spoke. I'm not sure that's better than having her at least form coherent sentences and be able to express her thoughts.
It is so difficult as an adult child to see the person who raised you become so frail. My mother would voice desires to die very often when she was aware enough to know that her mind was failing her. Miraculously she agreed to go on Celexa and it has made all of the difference in the world for her, and for those of us taking care of her.",2021-07-10 17:14:57,fakejewtalian,ohr2g3
Alzheimers,Can someone explain the aggressive side of it? Mother in law affected,"My MIL was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It started slowly. She couldn't find her words.

Then, she drove alone. Passed a bunch of stop signs and caused an accident. She went from being a perfect driver to, not so much.

Now she can't form full sentences. No one understands what she's saying. She doesn't recognize anyone. 

My FIL is a bit in denial. He agreed to revoke her license and sell her car only last month. 

One thing my husband's family and myself don't understand is the aggressivity.

My brother in law has a small dog. And sometimes she will harass the dog until he gets angry and then slap the dog.

Or, the other day. My SIL was showing my MIL their new patio.

Don't remember exactly the words but she didn't believe it was built recently and then yelled F YOU and flipped everyone out of nowhere. 

Can someone explain the aggressivity they feel?","Most of the time it is ""misplaced"" frustration from not being able to engage/communicate as they used to. There is a difficulty to process emotions and situations, cognitively speaking, and when a person can't do so or does not have the means accessible to do it like they used to they might turn to aggression and violence. Dialogues / conversations are hard especially when engaging on a topic where they think they are right or when there is a difference of opinion. Most of the time, the best way to approach the situation is to let them think that they are right. You will avoid an unnecessary confrontation and manage the emotion/frustration better so that the person does not have a block and revert to aggression. They are processing a different reality (to them, not to you) with skills that they are losing, which means they won't respond with a behavior you would expect. Get their attention on something to deescalate / diffuse tension.
Your MIL jumbled language should be approached like a puzzle scramble. She is giving clues about what she wants but you need to ""decide"" them. 

Developing this skill will help you and your family cope with the situation in a productive way. 

Being able to connect with your MIL and help her with her needs will make the remaining years of her life much better.
\- confusion at things not making sense

\- frustration at loss of ability to communicate

\- depression at loss of freedoms and abilities, such as driving

\- overexcitement, like too many unfamiliar faces at once

Protect the dog from her.  But other than that, try to provide a calm. quiet environment.  Avoid challenging activities when she is tired (sundowning).  Redirect rather than correcting her or arguing.  

I know it seems very challenging, but there are ways to deal with this.",2021-07-10 18:01:46,WeWannaKnow,ohrvs6
Alzheimers,Has Anyone Ever Beat Alzheimer's?,"Something we all hope for, though just wondering if there are any known instances of anyone recovering from Alzheimer's?","There really isn't. Alzheimers is such a destructive disease that if there were a person who recovered, it would make international news. About the closest you'll find is individuals who were misdiagnosed with Alzheimers and later diagnosed with a condition that could be treated and cured. I think, however, even those instances must be rare, as most conditions that can be confused with Alzheimers have so much brain involvement, that cumulative damage is permanent, and the symptoms do not improve.

It's a very, very hard thing to hear. If you or a loved one have been diagnosed, and you feel there's a mistake, don't hesitate to get a second opinion. However, you need to understand that if this is what's really going on, your energies are better used to preparing for the latter stages of Alzheimers and enjoying what you have now.

If you recover from it, by definition, it wasn't Alzheimers.
No, but you can change the pathway to be taken to determine how long you can live and ensure via lifestyle and health no matter what the DNA and diagnosis.  Maybe someday this or something else would be a scientifically identifiable cure!  We have hope.

Alzheimers,Advice on Next Steps,"I’m sure situations identical to mine have been posted 1000x so I apologize in advance but I can’t read through any more posts right now. 

I need to know what to do next. 

Mom is 71. Her memory has been declining for last last few years, which could of course be attributed to age. However, she has two sisters (so far) who’ve been diagnosed; one with early onset whose condition deteriorated drastically and the other who isn’t far behind. 

It’s at the point now where mom doesn’t remember things we talked about two days ago. She’ll call the dog the wrong name, forget the state I’m moving to, etc. I don’t live nearby so I can’t speak to the day to day ‘signs.’ 

I haven’t discussed this with her husband yet, which I know is probably step one. Im just concerned he’s going to say something to her which would be a disaster I’m not ready for yet. 

Among my many concerns I’m sure you all can identify with, there are logistical and financial concerns I’m thinking about. My stepdad is doing well, but fighting stage 4 cancer. As anyone dealing with cancer knows, “good news” lasts three months, until the next appointment. If something happens to him or his health declines, and she needs care within the next 1..3..5… years, I am completely unprepared. Should I be looking into a LTC policy? Is that even a possibility? Am I wrong to think I should be talking to my stepdad first? Should I look into counseling or a support group that might help with navigating the conversation with her? 

Many thanks.","Do not worry about just asking!  All of have been through information overload.  

I would say your first step is to talk to her husband (do you have other siblings too)?  Do you think he could avoid telling if you asked him to arrange calmly for her “checkup” with doctor?  Then you can join and talk to the doc? 

If you are in the states, the go-to of Office of the Aging on Health Departments.  People are really amazing, but that can vary by locality.  They have many resources they can help point you too.
If you've got the financial resources, look at independent living facilities with memory care. It sounds like they could both use a place where there is structured support and the sooner you move your mom, the better the possibility of a good transition. We were really hesitant about it & I thought they'd be awful, but some are actually pretty nice - good socializing, residents who seem happy and engaged, clean & maintained. They aren't cheap, though, so if they don't have those resources, then yes, you'll need to get creative.

I'd recommend a first step of scheduling a doctor appointment specifically to assess for dementia. In the lead-up to that appointment talk with her husband, you can point him towards some of the introductory spouse/caregiver materials, but get him on the same page that the first conversation should happen with the doctor, if for no other reason than that there's no reason to scare her if the tests indicate something else.
One thing to keep in mind with LTC policies is that they may boost rates to absurd levels suddenly. I've also known people who had them, had home care aides their mom or dad loved, and then suddenly the LTC company decided that agency or aide was no longer on the approved list and refused coverage. There's a place out in I think it's California right now that has been taking payments for years and has been sued as they appear to be shutting down. We talked to a lawyer and her opinion was it's better taking the payment you would be making and putting it into an IRA or CD instead. 

I do recommend asking her doctor about working with a neurologist and memory care team. They set us up with a social worker, and she helped. Also, reach out to area memory care communities that specialize in memory care services. We found one that turned out to be incredibly supportive and my mom lived with them for three years and made friends. It was expensive, and she ended up bankrupt and on Medicaid, but for three years, she seemed to have some of the best moments of her retirement years.",2021-07-07 17:56:50,Alarming_Concern8229,oft378

i'm 18 years old, i'm going to college next semester but my dad is working a lot in order to pay for my college and for treatment and for college 

i recently was unable to return to a job i was previously employed at bc i was late to turning in the papers and someone else had done it, and the other job i'm working at is slowly putting me on the schedule less,b bc so i'm currently making no money from that job, i could look for another job but i'd only be able to work until august 17th (when i leave for school)

my mom is the kindest woman ever and doesnt have a single mean bone in her body, it's heartbreaking to see her fall subject to such a terrible disease

ive also been thinking a lot about my future, i've got a 50/50 chance of developing alzheimer's myself, and i'm terrified that i'm setting myself up for a lonely future. yku see i dont plan on marrying at the moment and i don't want kids either. i'm unsure who i'll lean on if i have the gene

i need to get a gene test to see if i have alzheimer's","Listen. You are 18. 50/50 doesn't mean you have the gene, it means you have a chance. Even if you have the gene, you still can live every day to it's fullest. You can still have a fulfilling life, you can still work hard and get where you want, travel, do whatever you dream of and maybe have your own family someday if that's something you end up wanting, you never know, you might meet the right person and change your mind someday. 

My dad was diagnosed at 54 too, I was 23. Big hugs & love. I'm sorry this is the road you're on with your family. It sucks.
You’re not alone in this and don’t be hesitant to reach out and talk to people. Alzheimer’s is a big thing to deal with but it’s not a doomed fate or anything fatalistic like that. Alzheimer’s is neither good nor evil just people’s judgement that shall make it such. It can just as easily be the inspiration to live each moment to the fullest as it can be depressing. You choose your path.  You also don’t have to get tested for anything. Personally I don’t care to see if I’m at risk for anything I might have inherited. And just as a side note: if you haven’t already check with an advisor from your college to see if they have any medical scholarships you might apply for given your mothers diagnosis.
My mum recently got diagnosed and she's 52. This sub has been a great help. I also have a 50/50 chance of developing it too. It's scary. I highly recommend therapy for you and seeing if your mum can get into some clinical trails being so young. 

This sub has so much useful info and has helped me tremendously in coping with mum's diagnosis.

And at your age I recommend just living in the moment. Don't stress about the future and don't wish things like how you want this day or week to be over because if mum's diagnosis has taught me and my family anything it's to live in the now and not wish life away.

I'm here if you wanna talk. Feel free to PM me. Best of luck 💕
I am actually 54 now myself, and have mild cognitive impairment or MCI (as a result of a long ago accident/skull fractures).  MCI can predate early onset.  My mom also had early onset though was not diagnosed until she was in her 70s. 

As a result, I have been doing a lot of reading during some of the many evenings shared with my old friend insomnia!  OP you are so young and I agree that all of the advice here is amazing!  Thanks to all here now and on this sub.  Know that there are percentages — but also know you can influence them.  

There is a lot of individual variability and the steps you and your mom take now can influence the outcomes for you both later.  All the healthy practices you might imagine but also some you may not.  Things like engaging as much as you can socially and maintaining connectedness with others (not just engaging your mind).

I have found alz.org very helpful as well as research articles from the Mayo Clinic and others that translate solid research into brief and more easily digestible summaries.  Hang in there and know there is a lot that can change.  You have some agency here and so does your mom to make an impact now on your futures!  You are not alone in this fight.  ❤️‍🩹
You are thinking too far ahead, at least in terms of your own future. Concentrate more in short term goals, for your own sanity.

How do you know you have a 50-50 chance of geting Alzheimer's?
Get a blood test for b12. My parents are much improved compared to a decade ago.

I read this book over a decade ago, and it was turned into a movie recently.

Take care.

Alzheimers,Aducanumab / aduhelm,"Hi all,

Dad has moderate early onset Alzheimer’s. Haven’t seen much in this group about aducanumab. I know that it doesn’t have scientific backing. Still wondering, has anyone started looking into it with insurance? Is anyone thinking to try it? Thoughts or experiences? I just want to gauge where this community is at.","A Kaiser neurologist told us (about a week ago) that it wouldn’t be available for at least a month. Neuro said Kaiser would pay for it, if she was a candidate. Then he says he doesn’t think her diagnosis of Lewy bodies at the end of 2019 is correct and that she probably has FTD. So we are now waiting for genetic test results (4 to 6 weeks).
https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/aducanumab-noticias
I think the side effects are of a concern enough that I’m not sure it’s a good idea especially given how little reason there is to think it helps. Patients and families are often drawn to potential treatments and don’t put enough weight on side effects (it’s interesting to note that doctors and especially cancer doctors are often less likely to subject themselves and relatives to the same cancer treatments that their patients often demand)

IMO, when used it should probably only be started in someone with very mild Alzheimer’s or pre-Alzheimer’s, as I think it’s especially unlikely to work at any other stage. The trials were all at very early stages in part for this reason (if this type of treatment works, it needs to be done early).",2021-07-06 11:06:30,prontaa2,oewsdb

Alzheimers,What I learned from a couple weeks dad sitting,"My mom suffered through the pandemic solo taking care of my moderately affected dad and needed respite. So she dropped him off at my house under the guise of us “needing his help” with some projects and took off with friends. Here’s what I learned from it, and I hope it’s helpful:

1. We tried to keep busy. I knew he’d be out of his element and easily agitated with my mom gone. Every day we had either a small project to work on or a simple outing planned. 
2. We made sure to keep all car keys tucked away in case he got riled up. 
3. I allowed him to help me around the house and our farm. He was an engineer and loves to tinker. Even if it was something simple, like easy manual labor, he very much enjoyed feeling useful. Sometimes I had to go behind and fix things but that’s ok. 
4. He insisted on buying things for himself and has the money, but struggles with his card. I allowed him to make small purchases but helped him at self checkout. I also had to ask my mom for his pin as he couldn’t remember. It’s a point of pride for him and I didn’t want to deny him that. 
5. Alcohol is a problem. He wants to drink more than he ever has, and he doesn’t have an off switch. Instead of a nightly battle, I left a small amount of low alcohol beverages accessible to him. When we were out, I just explained I’d get more the next day. This really helped mitigate his symptoms. 
6. We gathered his wallet, phone, and reading glasses each night and put them on the night stand. Sometimes they were hard to find but I could ping his phone and things would usually be together. I had extra reading glasses tucked away if his got permanently lost. 
7. We stayed patient and calm with all our might. I reminded him to take a shower and asked if I could wash his clothes. I counted to ten when he asked the same things over and over. He needed more help in public spaces than I anticipated but usually accepted my assistance as long as I could get him on my side. 

I hope this helps someone. It was better than I expected and I’m sure I’ll have to adjust my strategy as he progresses. Good luck everyone.","Thank you for the sharing.
My dad is the same with alcohol, he will drink gallons in a day if left unattended with a supply. We do same with limited availability and also have started buying non alcoholic beer which seems to do the trick as well. As he progresses it's getting easier just to not have it around to remind him
Thank you, you sound amazing!
Great job keeping him occupied. The respite was more important for your mother than you will ever know. The pandemic year was very hard. Very isolating. I’ve been taking care of my mother since 2016. Moved in with her two years ago in October. It’s much, much harder keeping them occupied as time goes on. I found that in middle stages the things that worked best had meaning. Even when she couldn’t help me I had things to do for her to help me (me- household laundry, her- folding washcloths). She is end stage now. She can no longer leave the house to “help” me run errands. She will spend 30 minutes folding her washcloths though. Now they are usually just flattened and smoothed. You sound like you have a good feel for what your father needs. Hopefully you can keep helping your mother. The journey gets more tiring and heartbreaking as it goes on.
I wish I could offer this kind of respite to my mom, shit even for a few hours. Thank you for doing this for him and for sharing your experience with us here, but thank you more for giving this gift to your mom.
It helps me. Thnx.
We’re also struggling with alcohol consumption with my Mom (she just turned 70 and was officially diagnosed 3 years ago). She will start drinking at breakfast and will drink all day if she has access to it. My stepdad has had to quit buying what she really likes or she’ll chug hard alcohol like it’s a soda. We don’t want to take it away from her but are almost to the point it’s going to have to be under lock and key. 

I like the idea of leaving a few low alcohol beverages accessible. I’m going to recommend my step dad try this. I’m also not above telling him to cut the booze she likes with water!",2021-07-05 21:39:37,farmchic5038,oel1zc

Clothing inevitably gets mixed up and lost in the laundry if it's not labeled with his name.  Nightclothes, like a couple pair of pajamas, a nice robe and slippers, are a necessity.

Small things like jewelry, watches and glasses will get lost or misplaced very quickly; so unless you don't care what happens to it, leave that stuff at home.  Glasses were particularly a problem for my mom. She'd lose them quickly and for some reason they would never reappear.  I tried everything, even buying neck chains and ridiculous colors so they'd be recognizable as hers, but eventually I had to give up on the prescription ones and settle for reading glasses. YMMV.

A few family photos and personal memorabilia items can be helpful too, to make his room more familiar and personalized; and to share a little about who he is with the staff and residents.  I honestly don't know if my mom ever used it, but a bedside clock seemed like a nice accessory too. (She had a TV in her room, but usually watched TV in the common areas.

Alzheimers,A few weeks ago was Father's Day. This is what I wrote in honor/memory of my father.,"My dad died of mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia last August.  The following is something I wrote in honor of the first Father's Day after his passing.  I hope this is acceptable to share in this sub; it's part of my own personal processing of his passing.  Please take this in the spirit in which it's intended.
===
One day, when my daughter was two years old, our cat went missing.  We looked all over the house and didn't find her.  We walked out our front door, and didn't see her immediately.  But very soon we heard her meowing. I looked over towards the direction of the sound, and saw her - she had managed to get herself trapped on our neighbor's roof. I have no idea how she got up there, but you know how cats are. Cats have access to some form of unearthly magic that us mere mortals can only imagine.
But there she was; the magic she'd used to get herself on the roof was not enough to get her back down. My neighbors were not home, but I noticed they had a ladder set up against their garage door. So I borrowed it, set it up and started climbing to rescue the cat.

My daughter, however, was immediately scared on my behalf, in this dangerous situation she felt that I was in.  In her most terrified two-year-old voice, she shouted up to me, ""WATCH OUT, DADDY!""

It took just a moment; I was at the top of the ladder, the cat jumped down onto my shoulder and together we climbed our way back down to solid ground.  My daughter was immediately relieved, and spoke to herself in her most self-satisfied voice:  ""I Saved Daddy!""

Now my daughter is thirteen, and like any teenager the best thing I can do for her as her father is simply to exist in a different room from her. I'm told that's normal. I remember being thirteen and having the same attitude about my own parents.

But today is Father's Day, and in my case it's the first Father's Day since my father passed on. So that's a thing that I get to process today.

I actually never lived with my father growing up. My parents divorced when I was two years old and for most of my life my dad lived several hours, or sometimes several states, away from me. But I would visit a couple of times a year.  When I was younger he lived on an eight-acre property outside of a small Midwestern town.  Whenever I would visit we would alternate nights between shooting off the illegal fireworks he'd acquired from another state, or setting up his back yard telescope to look at whatever planets were in view that night. Through those evenings I saw the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn.

When I was ten he gave me the Universe.  When I was 21 he gave me a job.  By this time through his job he had survived a spinoff and a buyout, and he'd moved states a couple of times, and I accepted a summer college internship at his high-rise company in a major Southern city's downtown area.  It was my first grown-up job and I was impressed and inspired by his big-box corporate office. How many other 21-year-olds have the opportunity to land a summer job on the 35th Floor of a high-rise?

But then the summer ended, I came back to my home state to finish college, then went off to do some other things in other countries for a while. By the time I was 27 I landed in what would become my own career-defining job.  I've also survived a merger, a reorg, a Covid furlough and two rounds of layoffs, but here I still am. I like to believe I have his example to thank for my own longevity at work.

From my dad I inherited his taste in music; his taste in television; his sense of humor (sorry about that), but most especially his work ethic. And for that I'm grateful.

Last August he climbed his final ladder, the one he can't climb down from anymore. I can't save him, but I've come to the conclusion that maybe, just this time, he's the one who saved me.

Alzheimers,The true cost of an assisted living facility in Michigan? Options in the interim?,"Mom is the main caregiver for Dad, and she has hit the “I’m tired” and frustrated phase. He has progressed to the upper tier of the moderate progression of this course over the last 18 months. 

She comes from a childhood of poverty, and therefore has a mindset that there is never enough money for X,Y, or Z. However, my sister and I are fully aware that they have a net worth of over a million. Mom is reluctant to spend more than a day’s worth of having him at a local facility so she can catch a break or catch up on needed responsibilities, which is $175. 

I am concerned that she might act out in frustration toward him or simply burn out in the process of caregiving. She is also highly persnickety about people coming into the home. 

Mom and Dad are retired RNs, so this also makes the overall dynamic more stressful. I want what is best for them, but also know she is being stubborn to a certain degree. 

What is the true cost for full-time assisted living per month? My sister and I have talked, and we would have him in a decent facility in the event Mom somehow passed first.","I believe we pay $7,200 per month for memory care for my FIL in Oakland County. That's the ""sticker"" price and there is nothing additional. In fact other than health care (which the VA picks up in his case)  he has virtually zero other expenses. 

I don't think that's what you are looking for. It might be, but everyone I've seen in the memory care wing is without spouses. 

I'll add that a good chunk of a memory care facility is tax deductible which helps some with the expense.
The best thing you can do is contact a local facility where you would want to place him. They'll be more than happy to tell you pricing options and availability, and then they can also put you on a waiting list, so you'll always know where there are openings.

Alzheimers,Brother aggressive and in denial about mother's dementia. Vent/advice/needed to share where people won't judge. Tl;dr,"Hi peeps. 
Tl:dr 
mother getting worse, brother angry and in denial, we're pretty much the only people who are in contact with her. 

Mostly read in this sub so far, it helps me feel less isolated and guilty. 
I don't think I use the proper terms for everything, excuse that and please correct me if anything is offensive to you. 

Mother has alcohol related dementia(Korsakoff), since about 3 years ago. 

My brother became her legal guardian during her getting the diagnosis. 

Mom isolates herself completely from everyone. Brother only sees her for doctors appointments and to sort out finances and practical things. Understandable, it's just that the rest, as in her seeing anybody at all, falls on me. 
My parents are divorced so dad involves himself as little as he can with mom.
My friends are supportive but aren't going through this.


I'd been worried about her drinking problem for about 15 years before that, 
talked to family and friends of family since I was concerned but was told they didn't want to hear about it, and to not be so dramatic. 

Distanced myself for a while from brother as we didn't have a great relationship. 

It's like I'm back there now. 
Her dementia has progressed rapidly since Covid, and when I've been with her and she's driving, it's been pretty scary! 
Speeding when she ""feels like it"" as she says, and generally not following laws/rules as one should, and she previously has. 

So when her yearly test came up, I was a little relieved as her continuing to drive seemed dangerous. 

Got the results this week and they said she shouldn't drive anymore. Brother got VERY angry. 
He called to yell at the doctor as he thought them being rude stressed her out and made her fail. 

He's going to appeal. 
When he's previously said she doesn't need any help and isn't getting worse, I've suggested help that doesn't cost money as her house is a mess and she's just so isolated. 
Plus I've figured she will have to get used to having help as it will soon be a necessity, and better to get used to it now so she won't be so angry or shocked and scared when it's inevitable. 

He just gets angry and tells me if I don't agree with him I can do whatever the f*** I want. 
He gets angry with mom too, when she forgets things¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Juuuust a lot of extra strain, aggressive behaviour 
, work that seems unnecessary and very counter productive to me. 

Sorry for wall of text. Don't think there's much of a ""solution"". My brother is handling this his way and I can't change that. 
Just can't help but feel like this could be so much easier for him me AND mom if he didn't act affronted any time someone acknowledges the reality.","Not sure what I can tell you.  In situations where denial reigns, it usually takes something really bad to happen (car accident, broken hip, house burns down) for a change to be enforced by the government.

I do recommend you accept that drinking herself into dementia was your mother's choice, and there is a limited amount you can do now.   Although we naturally want the best for our loved ones, sometimes it's out of our hands.

If you feel she is in danger, you can contact whatever agency intervenes in cases like this.  It might be called Adult Protective Services.  But you might not be happy with their decisions, such as a forced sale of her house to offset nursing home expenses.
Must make it hard/impossible to make any plans and decisions together. It’s possibly a coping mechanism for him. One that neither of you should have to deal with. Keep doing what you can and place yourself where you need to be with your brother. Check in on how that feels from time to time and adjust if necessary or leave it right where it is. This was always going to be a strain on you all. Keep going and know that the situation is just incredibly hard and the road is rocky because of that. I hope your vent has been cathartic. Keep them coming xxxx
As a doctor, my advice is go to the next appt with your brother. The more open communication the better for your mom’s future care.

My heart obviously goes out to the doc who’s just doing the right thing, but to have family yelling at them and adding extra work for their office staff.",2021-07-04 09:34:57,Alanonacon,odkkl8
Alzheimers,Alzheimer’s Patient Recalls Daughter’s Birthday After Undergoing Fecal Transplant,,"The website seems to check out.  

[https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/)

I personally will think about the procedure more on if it can improve my relatives health.

Thanks for the post, OP.
I am really curious how long he can remember his daughter’s birthday.

It’s took years to get my wife diagnosed. Since she was in her early 50’s, I had a couple of neurologists tell us about a major study that said dementia patients are getting younger but it is still very rare for someone in their 50’s. So they tested for and tried everything else trying to find an answer. A couple of treatments had amazing results, but the improvement in her cognitive skills were very temporary. Zoloft and then steroid injections in her neck.

So as a layman with one data point, it could be the fecal transplant or a temporary benefit from the surgery’s medications. IMO
Interesting. I wish there was a better way to do this, but it may lead to a less invasive treatment as time goes on. There are also foods and supplements for good gut health.
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) seems like an Onion article, not a lifesaving medical procedure. 

Up to this point, no theories of Alzheimer's involved the microbiota.",2021-07-03 10:04:09,POTS_life,ocyo2z
Alzheimers,Mum too good for memory care,"Sorry for the length, needed a place to clear my mind.

Short history: mum has alzheimers and broke her hip in december. She is relatively young (just turned 70) and still remebers quite a lot. She will ask the same question 10 times, but does remember that I am job hunting.
At home, she didn't eat, didnt clean and fell often.
In the rehabilitation place, she found it hard to find her room

So we decided the best place was memory care.

Now they are telling me, she's too well. She doesnt have a connection with the other residents, because they are a lot more forgetful than she. And she is very independent.

I'm at a loss to what I should do. They say a different kind of care facility might be better, but I know if they give her too much independence, she will stop eating again and go back to her old ways. Also I'm not convinced she'll find her way back if she gets the freedom to leave the building.

The place she's at now is great. They take good care of the residents. Do fun stuff with them. Mums been there since march, and I can tell she's becoming less happy there. Thinking she can go home soon. (I told her once she can't. She was sad for the remainder of the day, but 2 days later she didn't remember)

I really don't know what the next step should be.","Keep checking with other memory care places if possible. The first one my mom was in said she'd be a great fit and then within a month, she'd wandered off twice because the aides or nurses didn't notice her door alarm go off. She was the youngest resident there and could easily manage to do things on her own that the other residents couldn't handle - showering, walking around, figuring out how to use the elevator and get outside... Her second place was amazing. They had all ages and different levels of dementia. Some needed constant care, others were independent and simply had nurses and aides around for reminders on when lunch was being served, when to take medications, etc.
We are in the same boat. She can't be independent but memory care is awhile off, we are looking into assisted living, more help but not a locked memory care. 

It's so hard! We don't want to move her twice.
Cherrish your conversations because some day she may choose not to talk and she will have the best poker face of anyone you've ever met. 
You have a long up hill battle, and tears are dripping just going through this ordeal too.Stay strong and have patience with all the emotions you may encounter too!!
That’s what happened with my mom too. We’re actually about to move her out of memory care and into the assisted living part of the building. It happened to mom’s only friend in MC as well. She was in MC for only a few months before they decided she’d be happier in AL.

The AL side still cooks all meals, has medication dispensed, has help on standby for showers, etc. Since mom isn’t a runner, or wanderer, we think it will be okay.",2021-07-02 11:41:20,suikercube,occptv
Alzheimers,Please remove this post if not allowed. I would just like some advice as I fear my mam might be showing symptoms of Alzheimer’s and I’m not sure how to approach this.,"My (57F) mam has always suffered from “Brain Fog” as she calls it. Forgets things easily, has trouble following instructions or just generally listening to people.

Lately it’s gotten worse,the other day she called me asking me how to buy groceries online (we’re all close contacts and isolating). We had a chat and I asked her to do something and get back to me.

She rings me 20 minutes later asking me if she called me..and if she did what did I say to her. It took all my strength not to cry.

She said my brother was annoyed at her for not remembering and she started crying. I don’t blame him, I get incredibly frustrated with her as well sometimes, even though I know it’s not her fault, it’s just so hard to see her so unable to perform basic tasks.

Anyway the memory loss and general confusion is getting worse, and I’m afraid if we don’t do something about it soon and there is a  real problem, it will only get worse when we could try and catch it early.

Everyone in my family seems to be in denial, they know she has problems but there’s clear signs of an underlying problem but they keep ignoring it, no one will take action and she won’t do it herself.

I’m only 23, no job currently and I don’t drive. There’s only so much I can do to get the ball rolling

I just need some advice on the best way to encourage someone to get help, while keeping a sensitive attitude as I’m sure this is very upsetting for my mam, and just the best way to get her checked out.

Thank you so much in advance for any help/advice","This sounds like a frightening experience for everyone. I'm sorry. I strongly advise you to encourage mom to go to a doctor. There are many reasons (treatable) for cognitive decline; nutrient deficiencies, tumors, hormonal issues. It's best that a doctor run tests to determine what is causing your mom's memory loss. While it is vert scary to think it's dementia, there is a lot of support and help. And early diagnosis is key to living a quality life. I wish you the best
You need to get her to see a doctor. It might be nothing, it might be menopausal, it might be an indicator or something much bigger, but you'll only find out if you can get her to a doctor. The earlier you can see someone about it, the better you can deal with whatever it turns out to be.
My advice is to go to a doctor and have a diagnosis. The sooner you do this, the better. Don't wait for her to get worse.
For a possible report, go to [cogminder.com](https://cogminder.com) and enter info.  Might help see if there's a sig cognitive problem and give advice.  Good luck.
Next time she says she has forgotten something, you say ""I notice you're doing that a lot lately.""  Then use the occasion to ask if she would agree to have her memory tested.

It seems to you she may have early-onset dementia; but there could be other reasons for forgetfulness, the one that comes to mind immediately being substance abuse or medication side-effects.  So don't diagnose this thing yourself!
I hear ya, bruh! It’s terrifying and incredibly sad to see your Mom, or Dad, in my case, suffering from Alzheimer’s. I am so hopeful that one of these biotech companies has a breakthrough…I’m really anticipating the results from the Cassava Phase 3b trials, and the LLY phase 2 trials…a lot of big biotech companies are racing for the first successful drug/treatment, and I don’t know care who gets it first, I just care that they get there…these companies are doing us all a huge favor, and I’ve got very little stake in all of them, bc I just can’t afford them right now.

Alzheimers,Why The Latest Alzheimer's 'Breakthrough' May Offer False Hope,,"That is the heart of the conflict. No one among the physicians or brain specialists on the agency’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee agreed with the FDA.  All but one voted not to approve the drug. The other member was “uncertain.”  That’s zero for, 10 against, and one more or less abstaining.
Thanks for the share, which I completely agree with.  I would give anything if one of the top 5 biotech company's tackling Alzheimer's get their breakthrough.  Seems like Cassava Sciences is in pole position, but it never seems to get the attention as the rest of the lot.
I think this sums up my hope/doubt about it:
>There really is no definitively right answer. Any doctor who expresses a lot of confidence is going beyond what the science tells us, but any doctor who simply refuses to consider the passionate requests of a patient or family member is not much of a physician.

Because of the slow progression of Alzheimer's and the idea that a ""cure"" can be thought of as a moving target (as the definition and understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease progression change).. I can understand the doubt, and therefore even some suspicion that the approval happened for less than sciencey or honorable reasons. But i can understand the desperation from the patient side of ""well, we know what will happen if we don't try this, so we may as well try it,"" coupled with decades of basically failed trials. 

What I really hope is that physicians really **understand** what led up to its approval by the fda, the controversies, risks, unknowns, everything.. AND take responsibility for explaining this to prospective patients so they understand it too. It should be like a combined informed consent for clinical research and clinical treatment. I feel patients would essentially be entering into an extended phase 3 trial disguised as a phase 4.

With one, she sprained or fractured the nurse's wrist, we never were privy to the full story. Her social workers and doctors all agreed she was a danger to herself and others. As no facility in my state can handle aggression with Alzheimer's to that level, she had to be moved to a neighboring state.

Alzheimers,Aggressiveness!!! Help!!!,"Please please please I am seeking for help!!!  
My grandma is 97 and she's been dealing with alzheimer's for a while now, bur her aggressiveness has been taking a toll on my mom's mental and physical health and mine too because we are the ones taking care of her. We are a bit short on money so getting a therapist or taking her to a nursing home are not viable options.  
I know, I know ""it's the disease talking"" but that isn't enough to help the issue.I'd be so so so grateful if you guys could give me some advice, please.","Hello, I am so so sorry that you were going through this with your loved one. I am also struggling with my mothers anger, aggressiveness, violence, with Alzheimer’s dementia. I speak with a therapist myself who helps family members of those with Alzheimer’s. She said the best tactic is to come up with a pre-thought out list of neutral or positive topics or activities to redirect the persons anger or aggression. 

For example: let’s say your grandmother is angry about the food that your mother made for dinner. One way to handle would be to acknowledge gently her anger, then say something like, “hey grandma, look how beautiful the sky is today.” Or something else positive like that. Just trying to redirect their mind away from negative repetitive thoughts. Or compliment something they are wearing or anything positive at all. You almost have to completely ignore the negativeness and just pile up the positive words and conversation. 

I’m not sure how receptive your grandmother is to physical touch or contact, but maybe gently taking her hands when she gets really aggressive and have her look at you might help slightly too? And say something like , “ grandma I understand your upset. Look at how beautiful the sky is today. What a pretty shirt you are wearing”. With my mother I found a few things that she is positively receptive to that or neutral or positive comments and thankfully because people with dementia or Alzheimer’s are very forgetful I can use the same comments over and over and she doesn’t take offense.

I’m so sorry, I know how hurtful and tragic and sad it can be to have a loved one suffering with dementia or Alzheimer’s. It’s a cruel disease to have. Hang in there you’re not alone
My mom became so aggressive that she broke her wrist attacking another resident. Then months later she attacked a nurse and sprained/fractured the nurse's wrist a day after attacking two paramedics. The meds she was on for paranoia, anxiety, and depression were not helping. At that point, she was declared a danger to herself and others. Haldol injections are what keeps her anger under control now, but it also meant she had to go into a facility equipped for the injections. That seems to be the reality when extreme aggression is one of the symptoms.
As others have said, a gentle redirection whenever possible, but also if you know there are triggers that make her combative, do what you can to avoid them. Especially contradicting or correcting her - e.g. if she talks about deceased people as if they're still alive, don't tell her they're dead. If she repeats herself (I'd be shocked if she didn't), don't say ""you already told me that."" If she tells you her recipe for meatloaf calls for three eggs, don't insist that it only needs two even if you've made it with her a thousand times, just sneak the third egg back into the carton. As much as you can, be with her where she is.

Alzheimers,Tips on Marking Clothes for Memory Care,"We are checking my dad into memory care the first week of September. Mom has asked me to figure out how best to mark his clothes, sheets, etc. for the laundry. She had friends tell her to order iron-on labels. But she said dad doesn't like itchy tags. After looking online, it seems some are saying to use a Sharpie; mom is worried it will seep through his clothes and show on the outside.

Can anyone offer some advice on marking dad's things in a way that isn't uncomfortable, stays legible, and doesn't look sloppy? Thanks so much!","We did just use sharpie on the tags and had no issues with seeping
We use a sharpie and that has worked well. My mother has been in several different memory care homes and it seems that is the technique that most of them have used. Yes some of the clothes it did show through, but I had to just let it go. Nothings going to be perfect for my mom again, she has dementia and not losing her clothing was more important to me then her initials showing.
Permanent marker always seemed to wash out after several washings. My mom's clothing was often vanishing because of it. I found that an iron-on label on a bottom inside seam seemed to work best. So, I'd to to the front bottom corner of a button up shirt and iron it there instead of on the collar. Pants, I'd do inside the bottom of the pant leg.
We used iron on labels. Happy to send you the link to the company we used if you're UK based.
Amazon has iron on labels super cheap. They take about a week to come in.
Office Depot sells labels marketed for labeling kids school and camp clothes. These have worked very well for us.

Edited to add these don’t even have to be ironed on. Very easy and inexpensive.
If you haven't, get the largest button clothes you can get. Also sweats or loose pants that don't take much to slip down.

However, what kind of assets does you father have? Does he have anything that will prevent him from receiving anything from the government for additional help? If he does have assets consider him ""gifting"" it to you or putting it in a trust in order to get more assistance in house or medical housing. Estate planning lawyer would be really helpful, some offer a free consultation where they can adjust guide you on what to do.. sending you on the best path but not doing the work for you

ETA; if hes living with you for the time being, charge him rent especially because he's a horrible person and because well youre going to have an extra person under your roof which incurs extra expenses.
It varies from state to state, but in my state, once a person is down to no more than $2,000 in assets, they qualify for Medicaid. My mom burned through her home's equity in the 11 years since she was diagnosed. She's now on Medicaid and the way it works is they take all of her Social Security and pension and leave her with I think it's $72 a month for spending money. She's now living in a Medicaid facility that specializes in Alzheimer's and the extreme agitation/anger that she experiences. I love my mom, but her rage was out of control, and after bring pushed into walls and attacking nurses and paramedics, it was determined for the safety of herself and others that something needed to be done to help her before someone really got hurt.
If his income is low and his assets under 2000 , he will qualify fir certain programs in certain areas. I'd check before moving him.

For example, PACE may pay for a day program and all medical needs but o ly I'm certain communities.

Alzheimers,"CalPERS Longterm care, anyone?","Hi there, I'm the adult daughter of two 80+ parents, one with Alzheimer's, who have been paying into CalPERS LTCG (long term care) for over 20 years. There's a class action lawsuit going on against the entity (it's run by the state of California). We're starting to get to the point with my mother where I think we'll need to start ""using"" the insurance soon, and have some help come into the house.

I'm totally uncertain as to how that process works, and how to interact with them, given their current legal status and the few interactions I've had so far. They aren't accepting new enrollment (this is the message that pops up everywhere on their site: CalPERS has suspended open enrollment due to current uncertainty in the long-term care market and is no longer accepting applications), and their website managers are very evasive as to why we haven't been able to log in for weeks.

I'm thinking there must be a more specific subReddit somewhere for folks who have that form of insurance ... anyone have any guidance to offer?","My Mother had a LTC plan with CalPERS and we used it for more than 5 years when she was diagnosed with memory issues.  CalPERS LTC was excellent; and it was much easier to deal with than I thought it would be.  In order to make a long-term healthcare claim with CALPERS, your mother will need to be in a condition where she requires assistance with a certain number activities of daily living (I don't remember how many).  Things like cooking, bathing, getting dressed, etc.  The plan paid for all of her room and board at the memory care facility which was between $5.5 and $7.5K/mo. over the last few years - more $ as she required more assistance.  Medical/dental care and supplies, and other expenses were handled via Medicare or paid out of pocket. 

Go to the [CalPERS LTC website](https://www.calperslongtermcare.com) to get the information and help you need.  (Forget about the web account. Just call the toll-free number and ask questions about how you can file a claim for your mom.)  There will be paperwork that her MDs will have to complete.   They are not accepting new members, but your mom is already a member and has been paying into the plan for years, so she should be good to go.  I can only speak for myself, but the CalPERS LTC plan was a godsend, and not hard to deal with at all.  They seemed genuinely helpful and knowledgable.  The hardest part was getting the memory care facility to submit the correct paperwork each month - which usually wasn't hard at all (except for one particular admin...).  

Don't worry about the class-action. It will take care of itself.  Good luck and bless you for taking such good care of your mother.",2021-06-28 11:19:22,irlandesaa,o9meas
Alzheimers,Pain sensitivity and dementia,"Could really use any kind of help/advice here.  I'll try to condense the backstory as much as possible.  My (40m) mother (70f), had been diagnosed with dementia/short-term memory loss a few years ago.  Up until a few months ago it was nothing more than her repeating herself quite a bit.  

Starting in February of 2021 she went to the ER with pain in her lower abdomen.  It was diagnosed as a UTI.  Cut to 4 months later. It was not a UTI, and since then she has had almost every test imaginable. CT scans, colonoscopy, urinary scope, gynological exams and utrasounds, etc, etc.  All the tests come back negative and the variety of specialists we have seen really don't have any answers.  She has been put on a variety of different meds in hopes that one might do the trick (overactive bladder, IBS meds, antibiotics). 

Every 24 to 48 hours she is in severe pain and wants to go to the ER or urgent care.  She has been many, many times and although I think part of her knows there is nothing they can do, in her mind if you are in pain that is what you do.  

Obviously, this whole thing has been really hard on the whole family.  To make matters worse her primary doctor was pretty terrible, And they are switching to a new one this week.  I know with dementia it can be very difficult for people to explain exactly what is happening with their body.  She has a follow-up appointment with a neurology center in August.  

I probably left quite a bit out, but that is the general idea of what is going on.","I would share this in the r/askdocs subreddit, as they’ll be better able to answer this",2021-06-27 13:24:31,mtbguy1981,o91hmj
Alzheimers,My Dad Has Dementia - Cannon Beach,"While i was living in Oregon, I surprised my dad with a trip to visit me. When I say I surprised him I mean, I repeatedly asked him to visit and he made so many excuses I ended up buying him a ticket and telling him to just show up at the airport.

Knowing what I know now about dementia, I think the problem was that he didn't know how to purchase a ticket on his own anymore. He didn't want to admit he needed help. 

When he got to Portland, he was excited to visit Cannon Beach, so we took the 1.5-mile drive down to the coast. When we arrived, my father stepped out of the car, looked at the beach, and got back in the car--he was ready to go. No explanation. And there was nothing I could say to convince him to stay longer. 

On the way back home, I stopped in front of giant logs on the side of the road and made my dad pose for a picture. He pretended to be a bear.

Alzheimers,My Grandfather,"Sorry, but I really need to get some things off of my chest and I feel as if this is the only place I can. Just yesterday my grandfather has officially been diagnosed with Alzheimers. My family has been seeing his decline over the past year or so, and it's been really hard to deal with. I've been close with him my whole life, and it really hurts just to think about. It's gotten to the point where he still expects me to get dropped off by the bus after school, even though that stopped happening about 8 months ago. Having to see a loved one go through this is in my opinion worse than death, and I really wouldn't wish this pain upon anyone. I try to call him as much as I can, but he just forgets I ever did every single time, and it makes me feel even worse. Again, im sorry but I just really needed to get this off of my chest.","I’m going through some similar stuff. My dads financial situation has gone down hill so I took over his accounts to get things back on track as his POA. Every week he’ll go off on me about overstepping my bounds and how I’m out of line. When in reality I’m the only one protecting his money and keeping him financially afloat. Sorry to hear about your situation.

Alzheimers,THC over CBD for Alzheimer's?,"There are published papers in PubMed saying that CBD and THC might help Alzheimer's patients. My mom's pcp is fully supportive of CBD for her agitation, but I didn't ask about THC. Has anyone looked into this or tried for a loved one suffering from this awful disease?","Mom has mild to moderate dementia. These days, the most obvious symptoms are her loss of working, short, and long term memory. She does, however, occasionally have insomnia, and it really bothers her. So, I suggested that the next night I give her one of my edibles. I actually only gave her half (5 mg each, THC and CBD). About two hours later, she called me downstairs, panicked that she was having a stroke. I did a FAST (Face Arms Speech Time) test on her, and she was completely normal. So I asked her why she thought she was having a stroke, and she said that she felt very strange, like if she turned her head, it felt like she was still turning once she stopped. Also, music sounded strange. And she felt kind of distant. Mom, I said, you're not having a stroke. You're high. I gave you an edible to help you sleep. Son of a bitch, Mom said. 

So, yeah, haven't done that again.
I've been managing a dementia patient for several years. 
Here is a summary of what I learned. 

- Reduce all unnecessary sugar. (See: Insulin resistance of the brain)
- Make hybrid strain teas and consume orally. 
Yes on THC/CBD combo. If the THC is not compatible with patient then reduce and increase gradually. 
(sativa/sativa hybrid for AM; indica/indica hybrid for PM)
- Eat loads of fat and micronutrients. (See: Keto, Paleo, & Mediterranean food collections)
- Also take a look at FODMAP lists to see if elimination of particular food may help with gastro issues (that often get the IBS hand wave diagnosis)
- Use vitamins and supplements because old digestive systems have reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food

If you got a Rx from the neurologist for Donepezil; take note/read about what are acytel cholinesterase inhibitors. Cannabis has those properties and more. 

Generally, the majority of neurologist (and in particular, all of the one's I met) do not know that 3 square meals a day helps the brain TREMENDOUSLY; most do not even mention diabetes type 3 because they are too busy talking about the cult of Alzheimer's and making to their next patient on time, about 12 minutes later.

Don't forget to patient's consumption of any substance with sugar beyond a glass a whole fat milk (what's that about 6-7 gm?). Restrict ALL fruits too and watch for improvements in behavior and ability to eat. 

If restricting all sugars and fruits does not yield the results you seek in 30-45 days then dementia is less likely due to an insulin resistance root cause.

I strongly feel that their side effects and costs will be a negative and that Cassava will be the medical choice for both patients, their families and doctors.","I don't see a lot of enthusiasm for Biogen and Lilly, and some frustration. They were approved without evidence that they actually help.
The medical community will (or should) always follow the evidence. Given how little evidence there is for efficacy of this medication, I’d be surprised if many people prescribe it.

Alzheimers,Imitation by Alz family member?,"My husband asked me this evening about his mom's strange behaviors. (He is staying with her while his sister is out of town this week) He said she will go to bed when he does and stay in bed until she hears him get up. She seems to be copying things he does in general -- not eating if he doesn't, going to the bathroom right after him, getting a drink when he does, etc. This is a new behavior just since we were there at Memorial Day. I told him it makes sense to me, and that between that and her not being able to read directions on a box of corn dogs & not knowing what she can make for dinner, it really sounds like she is at the point where she can't be living on her own. Am I making an accurate assessment? I only know of Alzheimer's/dementia though watching my aunt and uncle tend to my grandparents before they passed a few years ago, but in my husband's eyes that makes me an expert!","I think this could just be a form of attempted masking - she wants to show him that she’s fine and “normal”, so she’s mirroring his behaviours as she knows he’s an example of this. 

Something similar can be seen in children with learning difficulties in schools - they might not understand all the teachers’ instructions, but by following what the other kids do, they can blend in and hide it.

If you think about it, copying is how we learn most of our functional skills as a child.

All of which is to say I don’t think her doing it while he is there necessarily means she’s unable to respond to her own internal cues to sleep, get up, use the bathroom etc. To establish this, and determine whether she can live alone, you’d need to monitor her with nobody there and see if she’s soiling herself, not getting adequate rest, etc. The mirror instinct can be strong, especially if trying to mask to someone we care about, so I don’t think I’d make any big decisions based on this info alone.
Sounds like mirroring people's behavior has become one of her coping mechanisms. My mom was excellent at covering up just how much she didn't understand and that was one of her covers, though not to such an extreme extent.

I personally wouldn't be comfortable with her living on her own given what your describing but everyone is different. Big hugs to you and your family.",2021-06-24 20:10:09,birthwarrior,o7cbsl

Alzheimers,"Hospital , afraid of being alone","My mother who has early stage dementia is often in the hospital for 3-5 days with heart or kidney issues.

About 50% of the time she gets really really scared and nervous when I have to leave at night.  I am here caregiver at home and live with her.  The nurses usually understand but any suggestions on how to help her relax ?  

She has tried Ativan which sometimes works.  It seems like she has sun downing but some nights in hospital are fine others are really hard for her. 

Thanks!","I’m so sorry. Does she like doing puzzles or similar?  Maybe you can begin working a puzzle together and she will be able to continue when you leave. That helped my mother. Later in the disease, I took washcloths for her to fold. The activities helped her to settle while the meds took effect. I hope you find something that works. This has to be very hard on you both.
Have you tried music or putting pictures of you both together? My grandma is exactly the same; she’s literally petrified of anyone outside the family (she also has developed bad depression and anxiety so there’s that). We tried to set her up to feel as home as possible. She also complained about all the beeping and noises which highly irritated her so we got her a noise machine. We requested the nurse to turn it on for her some nights and she seemed to be a little more calm. There may be some trial and error with what will help her relax so I wish you the best of luck.
I don't have any advice but I sympathize after a long weekend in the ICU with my dad (with Alzheimer's). He doesn't know places any more so he had no idea he was in the hospital and not only was he confused but keeping him from pulling out his chest leads, blood pressure cuff, IV, and O2 saturation lead was a constant job. He also kept wanting to get up out of the bed which would set off the bed alarm.

Alzheimers,Negotiating with assisted living homes,"Hello All,  

I am trying to determine the best way to try to negotiate prices with assisted living homes and their crazy prices.  

I talked to one and they did say price was negotiable.  I was thinking about throwing $1,000 lower prices on the ones I do not want to send my mom to get some practice.  

Any thoughts out there or tips??

Thanks 🙏!!!!","I had no idea this was even possible!  We were very lucky to qualify my mother with a spend-down in Medicaid.  Looking forward to the responses!
Go for it! Well worth trying. You could say “We also like “ XYZ home” and their price is lower. Is it possible for you to reduce the price to “abc”?” Also have you worked with a placement agent? they can help work with your budget.
I've found it's best to be upfront. In one place, we explained the financial situation after my dad died unexpectedly and we learned he'd canceled life insurance policies. They offered a $1,000 reduction. Another offered to waive the move-in fee. The last one she was in before she had to go on Medicaid knocked $2,000 off for the first year and $1,500 for the others. If the amount of care needed isn't as great, that also helps. For example, my mom could dress and shower on her own, but meals and medication reminders were essential. The nurses could spend less time with her because of that.

She has to be covered up in jeans, long sleeves, a hat, and socks/sneakers. Coolibar is one of the companies I buy from frequently now. They sell UV-protective clothing that's relatively lightweight.

Alzheimers,My Wife had a Rough Day :(,"These are not my Words. My Wife Wrote This.

It's an uncomfortable and tender feeling being the daughter of a woman who has Alzheimer's. 

She is blissfully and sometimes unblissfully living in a different time and age. A time I didnt exist maybe, or maybe her young mother days. It could be four years back, I'll never know.

She herself is child like now, has developed a sweet tooth and the telltale bluntness that I've heard accompanies Alzheimer's, hurts you when you least expect it. I remind myself that's not Cathy, that Al. Fuck you, Al.

Today my mum asked me who I was very casually in the back isle of the discount store. She scoffed at my answer as if i was lying yet eagerly followed me. And i didn't know what to say to her. So I told her I was her friend. Which is true. But quietly, the Bargin-mania had become the backdrop to my sorrow.

I feel guilty and werid mourning my mums personality and her ways, while she is still here physically and giving that winning Cathy Barry smile. She truley is crucial to the whole damn operation. Responsible for so many planted seeds in my life.

I just fucking miss her. HER her. And I wish she understood that.

I don't share about this often,  but today, instead if going inwards and into the darkness, this short essay of my feelings seems correct.","It hurts when they forget you. Especially the first time. Your wife is going to have a lot of grief that she is going to go through and it will be hard on you to see your wife's sorrow. I am sorry that you both are going through this.
I feel your pain. I’m an only child caring for my mother. My heart breaks every day. I mourn each  new loss. I pray her suffering will end. She is end stage now and has lost so much. Then I feel panic and sorrow over saying a final goodbye. My entire family is affected by this disease which seems to be designed to extract the most suffering from the patient and everyone else involved. It’s terrible. Feel free to share. It helps us all put our unique suffering into words.
So much of this disease hurts. My mom used to tell us that her greatest fear was being diagnosed with Alzheimer's. When she was, it destroyed her. She'd watched a grandmother and then her mom go through it. Her mom was on a bed one day with a scarf tied around her neck trying to strangle herself as she said ""She needed the fog to stop."" My mom was so terrified that that would end up being her. When she was first diagnosed, she asked if she could use the state's death with dignity law, but the very first thing we learned was that Alzheimer's and dementia do not count as fatal illnesses because it's not technically Alzheimer's that will end up causing her death. I still say that's B.S

I sympathize with your wife. I have had my mom tell me she hates me and to go away and ever come back. In the middle of a store one day, she saw a beverage called Joint Juice and said out loud ""You should get this cause you're fat and it will protect your joints."" I went home that night and while I know it's the disease, that comment stung coming from her. I'd had years of comments from my dad about weight as a pre-teen and teen, which looking back, he was always overweight, so he wasn't one to talk.

My mom knew who I was the last time I was able to see her. Visits before that, she had no clue. The moments come and go. It's always going to hurt, but I've found that limiting my visits with her, while it seems selfish, have actually helped me. I've taken this time to talk it out in support groups and with my doctor. Turning my sights on caring for myself and letting others care for my mom has been the single-best decision I've made.
As a wife in her 40's who has watched dementia slowly remove bits of my dad I totally understand these words. Sending hugs and a shoulder to your wife for all those tears, and hugs to OP for being an understanding and supportive spouse.
💔
Me too. I’m so sad. So sorry you’re going through this too. My mom isn’t as far as yours. She knows who we all are. But she’s declining fast. 
Where does your live? Mine is current living with my sister and I. It’s so hard. I am dating. Have no kids or job. And while it guilts me beyond measure to say this: she’s ruining my life. The depression and sadness and responsibility is deafening. And sometimes she’s really mean to me. She’s not HER anymore.
Girlfriends mom has dementia and it’s been 2 years and doesn’t believe it. Worst thing is my girlfriend is 19 and her dad is an alcoholic prick that won’t do anything to help her mother out
Your post brought tears to my eyes. I had a really really hard weekend with my own mother.   I hate her sometimes….I hate her dementia / Alzheimer’s …. Sometimes I’m not even sure which one I hate or both.  She wasn’t the easiest person to love in her life and I mourn the fact that I will never ever have that now. I’m glad your mum was a lovely woman it sounds like and that she brought some light and love into your life when she was still “herself” as you say. I know how you feel.  hang in there.
I can absolutely relate to this. My dad thought he was 20 something (or maybe a teenager) in the late 50s early 60s. Wanted to talk to his parents (his dad died in 73 and his mom died in 91). One time I came into his room and he asked me who I was, I told him and his reply was “come on, you’re pulling my leg I don’t have a daughter!” It wasn’t always like that he’s slip between his early days and then be completely lucid the next moment present in the current day. He’d have a tear in his eye and ask me if he was dying. I’d always reply “Dad, we’re all dying. But today is not that day.” That seemed to help him a little bit. You’ll have good days and bad days. Revel and treasure those good days—— my dad passed away in November and I’m hindsight those days weren’t that bad. But that also depends on the kind of relationship you had pre-dementia diagnosis.
Oh my!!! You expressed my sentiments exactly. I am the caregiver of my 54yo brother with Down Syndrome and Alzheimers. I'm watching him evaporate before my eyes. It's heartwrenching. I feel for you.

Alzheimers,I snapped last night. I feel like a monster,"Our family is me (37F, single, not married, no kid’s) my father 74, and my mom 74 with dementia. 

Father’s Day weekend I snapped on my mother’s dementia. I got pushed and pushed and I couldn’t take it anymore. 

Here is some background: 

I’ve live the beach house my parents own. It had been a rental for about 30 years, until 2016 when my parents stopped renting it because they could no longer handle the responsibility in their older age. I moved into the house in 2017.

I was never a big part of this house until I became unemployed in my career due to mental health reasons. I was able to stay in this house for free which was very generous of them and I am incredibly grateful. It became obvious my mother is a hoarder who had been storing trash and furniture for years in this house. 

The property is in a resort area with million dollar houses all around. When I moved in the property was neglected like something you would see on the show Hoarders. full of trash, debris, broken lights inside, dirty refrigerator, fallen tree limbs, vines everywhere, insect infested. 

As a way to pay for my stay, I’ve renovated the house. By myself. I learned to do electrical, plumbing, painting, house repairs, landscaping, etc by watching YouTube videos. 

There were …FIVE… 1-800-GotJunk trucks that I hired and hauled away literal TONS of trash. I used some of my own savings, money I collected, and my parents money they gave me for this purpose to renovate. 

Fast forward to this past weekend: my parents came to visit for the first time in many months. It was going to be the big reveal so I was really excited for them to see the changes I had made and enjoy their fresh newly updated property with me. 

I guess my problem is that I forget my mother with dementia is not the person I want her to be….kind loving enthusiastic fun and reliable. 

Instead, she has dementia .

Before she got sick, she only parented me until about 12. She was rude, disagreeable, argumentative, cold emotionally, and never got counseling or therapy.  She is now the original woman - not very nice or easy to love - who now has dementia. 

That’s reality. 

It’s been hard for my dad and I. I hold a lot of resentment towards her now. As an adult I came to see my reality as a child for what it actually was, and find it impossible to imagine myself ever treating my own children the way she treated me. 


Dementia in my mother… is severe paranoia, aggression, instability, unpredictability, forgetfulness, sun downing, repetitive negative thinking patterns, irritability, flight of ideas, falling, and non-regular sleeping patterns.  She does however still have a lot of capability. She can make her and my father dinner every night, write checks to pay her mortgage, call people, feed her cat, use FaceTime, mow the lawn, drive to the airport.   

So it had become really difficult for me to determine where my mothers personality ends and the dementia begins. It’s like a slow fade out process. Every six months she has a steep decline. Then will stable out for a while then decline rapidly again. The frustrating part is in between she can function to a degree due to day but she has become a disagreeable mean and aggressive paranoid person. 

I feel like a monster for my wavering ability to tolerate her and remind myself that she does not have control over the physiological process her brain is going through. 

On Sunday night we had a fight, then made up, then fought again, then made up all in the span of about two hours. I should have known better not to engage with her at night.  She has sun downing but also gets more aggressive and irritable and violent at night. I had been drinking some wine to cope with the stress of them being there.  

All of a sudden - mid conversation about some trash I found while excavating the beach house backyard - it was like a switch in her brain flipped.   

She started telling me that I lied to her and that she doesn’t trust anything I say and that I hate her and that I think she is an awful person …and on and on. She got in my face yelling, her expression twisted up with anger and aggression. 

And I snapped. 

I screamed at her that I hated her and she was ungrateful. I pushed her back away from me. She got scared and called for my dad. I Threw and smashed a wine glass on the floor in front of her, and chucked a pillow and water bottle. She was startled. 

I took a step back from her, realized what I did, tried to slow down my heart rate and decrease the adrenaline in my body. I burst into crying. I removed myself from her. Went into my bedroom, sat on the bed crying uncontrollably. Then called 911. 

I scared myself. I told them it wasn’t an emergency but I just couldn’t do this anymore and I wanted the police to come to the house. 

I guess it was to protect her from me snd me from myself. They asked if I had been drinking? I said yes. They asked if I was on drugs? I told them no. They asked if I had any weapons in the house? I said no I’ve never owned a gun and no weapons. They asked if I was around my mother? I told them no I separated myself from her.  

Within a few mins there were two cop cars outside my house with two female officers. I talked to one in my bedroom and explained what had happened. I told them I scared her. I pushed her away from me. I told her she has dementia and I snapped. I lost it and I couldn’t do it anymore and I wanted to be away from her. 

They ended up bringing me to a motel in town with my dog. I brought my pillow and a blanket, some pajamas, dog food, dog leash and some treats, my toothbrush and contacts case. The motel was right down the street, but just being away from my mother made me feel horrible and relieved…all at the same time. I eventually passed out in the motel room. Woke up, made sure my father and mother were on the road back to their home and I got an Uber back to the beach house. 

Now I’m writing this because I feel like a monster and I needed to get it out of me. It’s traumatic and every time my mother has visited me here in this beach house in the past couple years before this, something has always happened. She locked us out of the house once, got lost in a beach parking lot, started an argument with a random woman in a park I took her to.  The list goes on.   I feel like a monster saying this, but I really hate her. I hate her dementia.  But I also don’t like the woman she was before the dementia so it makes it even harder for me to tolerate her now.   I don’t know what I’m going to do.   
I do have a therapist appointment , a woman I used to see who happens to work with families of people with Alzheimer’s . She has some really good insight and made me feel less alone. 

Thank you for reading this if you got to the end. I hope I’m not a bad person. I don’t think I am. I am in the medical field and I love helping my patients and caring for people. It’s what brings my life meaning and purpose and I love my job (when I’m not unemployed in my career field). But when it comes to my own mother and her mean and aggressive behavior with dementia and our past mother daughter relationship…..I feel evil and bad for not being more understanding. I feel awful about myself and don’t want her to be in my life like this.","You are not terrible, just learning to deal with a terrible situation. Hugs.
I’m glad you have an appointment with a shrink. They can be really helpful. 

Don’t feel bad. I blew up at my mom a couple of times whe she got physically violent with me. She’s at the point in her disease where she’d forgotten it a few hours later. Both times, I made an emergency call to my shrink to deal with the outcome and prevent it from happening again. She’s in respite at the moment while I’m finding a permanent placement for her. 

You and your dad should start making plans along those lines, in case your mother becomes too much to handle.
I am so sorry to hear about this but I don’t think you’re a bad person in any way. By the time we put our mom in a home I absolutely hated her too. I am thinking of you.
This shit happens. Alzheimer's is a monstrosity and none of us are equipped to be perfect caregivers 24/7. The bright side? Your mom's fading memory will almost certainly forgive you. 

But make sure to take care of yourself. Therapy's a good step. My mom found a lot of solace in a local support group -- there may be something similar available for you. It's an extremely hard road, and no one can do it without help.
If you are like me you are going through grief. I was taught to express my emotions through screaming and throwing stuff. My mom is also a hoarder. Don't feel guilty, it's very normal. I snapped many times too.

Once the disease progresses you'll come to terms with it and what to expect from your relationship with her. The easiest way is to just say ""yes"" to everything and don't get worked up in their ""logic"" (because there isn't). ""Sure mom, I'm a terrible person, why don't you set the table? (and change the subject)"".

I guess you had other expectations of her visit and seeing her must've felt like a shock.

This applies even for the shitiest of relationships.

I'm the same age and gender as you, also live alone, no kids, my parents are the same age. BTW. I have a sister but no dog, though
Don’t beat yourself up over it, it happens. Caretaker stress is a real thing when it comes to Alzheimer’s. While balancing your own life, career, priorities etc. And having to be a good filial daughter for your parents can’t be easy to manage. 

I speak from experience, I have lost it before when my dad who suffers from Alzheimer’s lashed out at our caretaker(scratching and swung out at her). So, it was more of seeing a female getting scratched that sent me over the edge, I pinned my dad down which probably didn’t help matters since it just provoked him further and he straight up kicked me full strength. And my brother had to step in to pull me away to calm me down. 

It happens to everyone, you are not alone. Chin up and stay strong.",2021-06-21 20:02:53,Professional-Way1831,o59aqs

Alzheimers,A Walk Through Dementia - walking home,,,2021-06-21 09:56:54,wellheynow,o4vpa1
Alzheimers,How do we take the dogs away? (xPost from r/dementia),"Hi everyone-

I'm posting this here as well in hopes of getting as many opinions as possible.

My Papa (mom's stepdad) is quickly deteriorating into the grips of dementia. It's very sad to see. He has two labrador retrievers. They are both 11 years old, overweight, and arthritic. Papa does not want to pay for the medication that could help them live more comfortably (arthritis meds), nor does he want to pay for diagnostic visits when they get sick (this was a recent occurrence with one of the dogs), nor does he want to pay for euthanasia (I do not believe either of them need to be euthanized).

I suspect he is overfeeding them, forgetting to let them out (they are having accidents in the house), and giving them table scraps. The other day, he forgot he only had 2 dogs and thought he lost one when he let them outside (thought he had 3).

My husband and I have a farm with tons of space. We have offered to take the dogs in. My mom attempted to have this conversation with Papa, but from what I understand that didn't go very well and Papa got angry about it. However, the other day when one of the dogs was ""ill"", he asked Mom if we were still open to taking them. Apparently, in his dementia-riddle mind, we can have them if they are sick, but not if they are healthy (or as healthy as they're gonna get at this point).

I explain all of this to say: I feel he shouldn't be the caregiver of these animals anymore. But I also don't know how to go about getting them out of his care. Does anyone have any advice for how to do this? Or am I way off base?

Thank you in advance.","Just start having the family tell him that the dogs are sick and that you'll take them until they are better. Stick with that story and when he asks about them continue to say they are sick and you are trying to get them better.

BTW. CBD oil did wonders for our senior dogs and their joints.
I have been in your shoes. Be prepared for a challenge. Your dad will be sad. It may lead to him wandering. His dogs may have bad behaviors that you don't know about until you get them into your home. 

He attacked my cats constantly, growled, and snapped at bicyclists, kids, and adults when we'd go for a walk. He growled and attacked my dog regularly if I let them in the same room. After three months, I'd broken him of growling at kids, but he wouldn't stop attacking my cats or dog. He also kept growing at other adults. My dog's usual behavior changed completely and he wouldn't come out of our room, even for walks. He stopped eating, too. At that point, I knew I needed to rehome him, as I didn't have the money for the professional trainer he needed and he was a menace.

She'd let them out, go brush her teeth, and then went to bed forgetting the dogs were outside. Too many times, she would get up at 3 or 4 a.m. because the dogs were at the door howling to be let inside. One morning, I showed up to find she'd decided to just leave her patio door wide open. It was 30 degrees F that morning, so the furnace was running like crazy to keep the house warm.

She started feeding them the meals I'd cook and leave for her. She'd also feed them their food, so they were gaining weight like crazy. We took care of the vet visits, but every day we'd show up to find the dogs hadn't been let out all day and had gone to the bathroom on the floor.

When we finally took the dogs from her, I took one and my sibling took another. We told her we were just borrowing them to play with my dog (the sibling to one of my mom's dogs). This is where another issue arised.

The dog I took was younger. I will forever blame the breeder for letting an elderly couple have a puppy. My mom clearly had Alzheimer's at that point, and my dad lacked mobility to keep up with a dog. He died suddenly when the puppy was a year old. The puppy had had no training and was a nightmare. He knew me. He knew my dog. They got along great at my parents' house, but in my house, he turned into a completely different dog. That's why rehoming to your house may or may not work.

He attacked my cats constantly, growled and snapped at bicyclists, kids, and adults when we'd go for a walk. He growled and attacked my dog regularly if I let them in the same room. After three months, I'd broken him of growling at kids, but he wouldn't stop attacking my cats or dog. He also kept growing at other adults. My dog's usual behavior changed completely and he wouldn't come out of our room, even for walks. He stopped eating, too. At that point, I knew I needed to rehome him, as I didn't have the money for the professional trainer he needed and he was a menace.

When I called the breeder about the contract that said to return dogs to her if it didn't work out. She never returned calls or emails. We ended up working with the humane society where he had to go into one-on-one foster care with a professional trainer and rehomed him six months after that.

Alzheimers,My Grandma,hey yall. around my early teens my grandma had begun showing signs of dementia around the time she was trying to become a us citizen. after a while my entire immediate family saw what was coming. at this particular moment she no longer consistently remembers me or my brother's name. in short i feel as if one of the people who raised me and gave me a lot has been subject to fate much worse than death. this has been difficult to process and take for obvious reasons as its like watching a death in slow motion and i wanted to just rant about it SOMEWHERE.,"My sympathies. If you need to rant, ask questions, etc, feel free to reach out. We've all been there.
Sorry to hear about your grandma- take care of yourself, and help take care of her.
Totally understand how you feel. I’m so sorry. Alzheimer’s sucks ass. Hope you have ppl in your life you can vent to, but also know we’re here for you when you need it. Head up, young person!",2021-06-19 13:59:32,LeotheBomba,o3lx9v
Alzheimers,Sleeping,My 87 y/o Mom w/mixed Dementia has started sleeping about 19 hours a day. She does have a mild cold but the sleeping started just before the cold. Should I let her sleep? Should I try to keep her up? Is this end stage? Anyone experience this with their loved one?,"My grandma has slept 24+ some days. We typically check on her every few hours just it make sure she’s breathing honestly. She typically does this after a lot of interaction or busy days. 

We’ve accidentally woken her up before and every time she is either highly confused or angry. So best to let her be and get the sleep her body needs. 

Also enjoy the peace and quiet.
Oh yeah. Just let her sleep. Just move her onto the opposite side and back so she doesn't develop sores.",2021-06-19 14:09:52,Nini2935,o3m61f
Alzheimers,Wandering?,"My mom has recently started getting up in the middle of night (3 or 4am is my best guess) to try and walk 'home'. My dad and I are starting to get worried because the same police officers keep finding her and walking her back, and at some point they might call in APS and they'll take her.

I've read a bit about disguising the door and installing extra locks, but I was wondering if anyone's had success with other methods?","First thing we did was put bells on the bedroom door so we would hear if my dad got up.

Then we put slide locks at the base of the doors we could slide with our foot. Dad never noticed them while trying to open the door.

We also used those caps for door handles meant for toddler safety. Makes it more difficult to get the door to open.

Do this ASAP! If she gets out by herself she can easily get hurt, hit by a car or not be found.  If you can't get locks installed today, put a piece of furniture in front of the door to prevent her from opening it during the night.
If someone lives with her, a simple motion sensor based alarm should do it.  If she exits the bedroom, for example, the alarm is triggered and someone else wakes up and can intervene.  I would strongly caution you against using any locks or physical barriers that would prevent her from being able to get out of the house in the event of an emergency.

Here is a free 24/7 phone number you can call any time for help regarding alzheimer’s related issues:

1-800-272-3900

It’s run by the Alzheimer’s Association.

I’ll bet whoever answers has dealt with situations like this before and has some good advice to offer.
We keep a big desk in front of our front door at all times.
I'll be honest locks are the best, they make some specifically for people with dementia that you can fairly easily install, are easy for regular people to open and close but are hard to figure out for dementia patients especially if you place them near the top or bottom of the doorframe. I got these for my dad and so far working very well:

We got a child lock for the deadbolt on the apartment door and it was perfect.  If grandma ever asked about it we told her it was a security feature so no one could break in (which was one of her big obsessions). No way was she figuring out how to open it.
Try hiding her shoes. My mother usually wouldn't go out without her shoes.  We tried the child locks on the door handle but my mom figured them out. And both the child locks and keyed  deadbolts on some doors fed into her fear of being locked in during a fire. Also, if you can, start looking into memory care options...
We have a slide lock and there’s a little hole that we drop a screw in and it can’t open. She can’t figure it out
I put in a double keyed deadbolt. She escaped twice when I forgot to lock the door but luckily she just went and sat in the truck.
Best thing we found was a deadbolt lock that required a key to be opened",2021-06-18 14:18:11,SolemnMinh,o2wjfn
Alzheimers,I found the perfect phone!,"So my dad is 75, diagnosed with general dementia about 3 years ago. He has recently regressed where his iPhone is too difficult for him. I've done my best to remove most of the apps and turn on various accessibility features.  However, he still manages to turn on airplane mode, turn off the volume, turn on do not disturb mode, etc. Today, he's officially ""lost"" his phone, aka he hid it somewhere in his paranoia and is now saying it never worked 🙄. I really wanted a phone that I could dumb down for him, and found this:

https://www.razmobility.com/solutions/memory-cellphone/?ref=9

Honestly, I'm so happy I found this! It gives me the power via a laptop to control his view and settings, while still allowing him to be independent. 

Has anyone used this phone before?","I’d like to see a “find phone” option on here too, they’d definitely misplaced it!
I would have loved to have had something like this when my mom was alive. Curious also to hear someone’s experience with it.
It looks awesome, but my mom won't carry a phone. She won't wear a watch or necklace either, and she rarely thinks to grab a coat before heading out the door. Those were all some of the reasons we opted to move her into memory care where someone is awake at all hours.
My grandma got the jitterbug and she absolutely hated it. As she progressed, she couldn’t type or slide open the phone. We had to downgrade her to a flip phone where the only thing she has to do is open it to answer the call. She also couldn’t navigate or remember where contacts were on either phone so we’re going to try to get her a phone book so she can look there (she’ll lose that too im sure though). 

I’d just say that as he progresses further get a flip phone or something very very basic. But not the jitterbug lol that phone def sucked
Awesome, thank you for sharing this.  Now if I can only get my mom to carry it, but that's an entirely different battle.

Hang in there everyone, this is extremely difficult and as loved ones and caregivers be kind and forgiving to yourself.
Wish this was around for my dad. His iPhone gave us all sorts of headaches, especially when he kept changing the passcode! You'll need to post a review soon!

Alzheimers,Helpline For End Of Life Patients & Families (UK),"Hi everyone!

There is a new helpline for a pre-bereavement charity in the UK which I think could be really helpful for anyone in need of a little extra support surrounding terminal illness/end of life.

The Anne Robson trust give support to anyone facing the end of their own life (if you're terminally ill yourself), people dealing with the upcoming death of a loved one (terminally ill family members), and also people who work in environments with people who are dying/at the end of life (nurses and care staff for example).

They'll talk through anything and everything surrounding dying, and I think they're particularly useful for those moments where you're struggling to cope and you just need to talk through your feelings with someone who will listen (and help you find ways of coping with your specific situation, if that's what you need).

Taken from their website: **""The helpline number is 0808 801 0688. The service is confidential, free to call, and operates Monday to Friday between 12 – 6pm""**

Their website has more info: [www.annerobsontrust.org.uk](https://www.annerobsontrust.org.uk)

I hope that this might help someone who needs it!

Alzheimers,Looking for advice for working with people with Alzheimers,"So I'm looking for advice, I am fairly unexperienced with dementia and alzheimers and I have just accepted a job as a chaplain in a hospital, 20% of my time will be spent in a seniors home that is attached to the hospital. Most of the seniors home residents have varying stages of dementia.

I only start the job in a few weeks so I am trying to gather resources while I have some free time. I am finding a lot of research on music and using familiar music to help seniors engage, I do play guitar a bit so I am planning on maybe learning a few old hymns and stuff like that (the seniors home is in a small bible belt town).

What are some things you've learned about this disease that would be helpful for a caregiver?","Not specific to Alzheimer’s, but to dementia generally, is to “meet them where they are”. If they are telling you that they are 30 years old and looking for their husband, just go with it. Sometimes they give Alzheimer’s patients baby dolls to carry around for that reason.Don’t try and talk them out of their reality. They can’t join you in yours.

Oh! Let me also put in a plug for you for the Well Spouse Association. We are the only nonprofit organization that provides resources for the spouses and partners of people with chronic illness and disease. We have a lot of members whose partners have Alzheimer’s. You may come across exhausted spouses in your work who could use a resource like us. Wellspouse.org. R/wellspouses
Each person with Alzheimer's disease will experience its symptoms and progression differently. Individualize your socialization, do not provide a blanket approach as if each person deals the same way. Some may appear to have higher functioning and not the usual depiction of dementia. Some may be much closer to end stage. Be patient. This website may help you. https://www.beingpatient.com also consider there are other Dementia sub types such as LBD and FTD.
For the music it would be the best if you could find or play things that are familiar to them from when they were in their teens to maybe 30s. I guess if its a bible belt area, old hymns might be good, but on the chance they arent familiar you could try to popular music of their younger days.",2021-06-16 10:03:27,Mennonite_man,o15n2p
Alzheimers,Is it the dementia saying things or..?,"My mother is 91, with Alzheimer's. We've never had any easy or close relationship. Last week my dad, her husband of 70 years died. 

While I was crying (at the palliative care when he died) and holding her she said that my grief and feelings didn't matter, only hers mattered. A lot of other unkind things as well.

Last month she flat out said I was a mistake, not even an accident.

All of it rings true. She would have been happier without children and she stopped parenting me when I was 7. 

Is it the Alzheimer's speaking or has the Alzheimer's just removed her filters and releasing her true feelings?

It hurts so much.","My mom, who has Alzheimers, once told me a story from her nursing school days. In a neurology class, one of the students asked why it was Alzheimers makes some patients so *mean*. The teacher explained that as Alzheimers destroys the brain, the functions of the most recently evolved parts of the brain go first, because they're more fragile. You don't have to have them to survive. So, the neocortex (the most evolutionarily recent part) with its executive functions - focus, planning, predicting, visualizing, and so on - goes first. Then it works its way inward - memory, emotional stability, learned skills - and it just keeps on going, until it gets to the oldest part of the brain, the reptile brain. And that is just survival, and survival is *mean*.

Now, not all patients go that way, but enough of them do, that I think it should be considered the default condition. Your mom has lost all the layers that made her or could make her an empathetic person. The only way she knows how to get what she wants is to be mean.
It is the disease. It is hard to separate the two (your mother and the disease) but you really need to learn to do it or else you will be more miserable. It is really hard and took me a couple years. My mom was the sweetest woman to me when she was in her right mind. Now every time I talk with her she calls me a fat cunt who she regrets. It sucks but I know it’s not her. 

I am very sorry to hear about your father.
So sorry for your loss.
Please seek a referral for individual counseling. In any event, this type of behavior from a parent can set a child of any age into a tailspin. Be well, and my heart is with you.
I’m sorry you are going through this. I just yesterday tried to understand where my mothers personality ends and her dementia begins. 

It didn’t end well for me. Fight and ended up leaving the house I live in that they were visiting me at to stay in a hotel for the night. I’m a 37 F single not married for reference.
> Is it the Alzheimer's speaking or has the Alzheimer's just removed her filters and releasing her true feelings?

I’m so sorry this happened. You will drive yourself crazy trying to split everything that is happening into “real” and “the Alzheimers “. 

It isn’t as simple as “the alzheimers was adding new thoughts that weren’t really her” versus “the alzheimers was revealing thoughts that were always there”. 

In that moment she was someone with alzheimers. The disease had changed her. She was a different person. There is no way to run it through a decoder.

I wish I had more clear cut answer.",2021-06-16 09:23:39,BlueCatLaughing,o14s81
Alzheimers,Newly diagnosed MIL,"Hi all, I just wanted to introduce myself and our situation. We started noticing some things about my MIL 2-3 years ago, and she recently got tested and diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. There's significant history in her family 

We're in the early stages of discussing options for her and her husband going forward. I'm thankful there's a community here that I can come to for questions as they arise.

Right now we're trying to get them to accept in home care. They live at a facility that allows residents to move from their condos into assisted living and their nursing home facility. They wish to stay in their condo as long as possible.

I'm going to be scrolling through here to see what kind of treatments and suggestions you ask have been throwing around and really get acquainted with add much as possible.","My Dad was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, so I know how desperate things can be...heartbreaking. :(  I am very hopeful for thee phase 3b trial of Simufilin will prove successful in not only combatting AZ, but also, improving mental cognition...There are several other drug candidates out there, but after my extensive research, I believe Cassava Sciences in the pole position within this space. Thank you, and keep up the good work, $SAVA!
I’ve heard it is best to Put all the finances in his name And have them get divorced. Get her on Medicaid asap… My parents did not… but we didn’t know better…You could be looking at 10 years of downhill.  We are at year 10 with my mom. Last 4 in a home. So sorry really. But it can be a so dreadful and taxing on everyone. Of course you love her…but you have to protect your finlaw more.
My condolences for your family at this diagnosis. Don’t forget to take care of yourselves along the way as this will be a difficult journey.

It’s great that your MIL and her spouse are already in an “aging in place” step up kind of facility, but I would make sure that their nursing care is fully equipped for memory care when the time comes. 

My other advice would be to provide as much routine and simple aids, like labels around the house, as possible. Plan for things to get worse before they do. Is she highly mobile, will she wander? If they haven’t lived in the condo for very long before she started showing signs she may begin to ask to go home to a previous house. You mentioned getting them on board with in home care, which is great. We sold the in home care as a “cleaning lady” who gradually stepped up the assistance they provided as my MIL grew comfortable with their presence in the house.

Also, as a fellow child-in-law there will come a time, it may have already happened I don’t know your situation in this regard, where they don’t remember you at all. My MIL went through a phase where she called every in home nurse aid my name before finally forgetting the name completely, but I was just a nice lady that lived with her from a pretty early period.
Sorry that you have to be here, but glad to see you to already have some care in place and a family willing to acknowledge the problem. We live in a different state from my MIL, and husband has been going up more frequently to see her and help the one sibling who lives in MIL's town. (Like this week, when SIL has to be out of town for a week) While SIL sees the problems, she sometimes believes her mother must be faking the delusions to avoid something, and at other times, says ""Alzheimer's isn't just forgetting where you put the keys, it's forgetting what the keys are"" and since their mother isn't that far gone yet, it must not be Alzheimer's. So, we are still battling that one. Heaven forbid my husband bring up any future ""what-if"" discussions.",2021-06-15 13:27:12,staceybassoon,o0jpsd

Is there a device that just has pictures of family members on the home screen and then all he has to do is click on the picture of who he wants to chat with? Or does anyone know a better solution?

Thanks!","We got a used IPhone for my elderly Aunt, and removed all apps but FaceTime. If he can handle a regular phone, you may need to call him first, and then talk him through the video call process.

There are some where you put a person's picture in place of a phone number or button. That said, my mom never took to video chat and she hates phone calls too. Visiting through a window was also impossible. If she couldn't reach out and touch you and be face to face, she'd get mad.
Look into the Grandpad! We love it for my mom. She’s still learning it, and you do have to click on to the phone but the buttons are huge, it’s the size of a tablet and you can put pictures with the contacts so it’s an easy call. I believe they also do a 30 day trial in case it doesn’t work out. :)

Alzheimers,Visit grandpa before passing,"Hello,

Im not a member of this comunity but I would like some advise from people who know the desease. My grandpa has Alzheimer and is coming to his final stages. My uncle who visits him regurlaly informed everybody yesterday that he wont have long anymore. Now my father has no bond with him due to my grandpa being a heavy alcoholic most of his life. Since my grandmother past away around 2000 the contact has gotten less and less. For me to because he was always drunk and not really gave us any love. 

When my son was born I visited him with my dad in the nursery home and that was okay. He was nice and not drunk for the first time in my life. My dad moved to Portugal soon after and I haven't visited him on my own. Before my dad left he gave me a present from my grandpa. It was a little wooden house that I used to play with at my grandparents house when my grandmother was still alive. I didnt even know he still had it or that he knew it was something I would like to have. It made me very emotional cuz it made me feel like maybe he did pay some attention when I was a kid. At first I wasn't able to visit do to COVID and then because of having no transport to the home. Maybe I also didnt feel like putting in much effort beacause I already have other things Im in therapy for.

Now I feel like I should visit him and pay my last respect to him. I dont want him to die knowing I didn't visit him. That leads to my question. Will he know? Will he know I did not come and say goodbye? My uncle says he does have some clear moments. Plus I also believe that when you die your soul gets released. (I dont what I believe what happens with it after that tho). So Im really torn. Im also afraid it will be a unplessand experience for myself since now I will only remember that one nice last visit and the gift he gave me. I dont know what to expect... 

Please share your wisdom and advise.","Oh, yeh, it's sad.  So lovely, the little wooden house!   Idk, he might have clear moments when you visit, and maybe not, he might recognise the wooden house, if you take a photo of it to show him, and/or you as little kid, who knows!   But if you don't go and then might regret it later when it's too late, then maybe you ought to go.  That's a tough one, only you can decide.   I wish you best of luck!
My two cents. When in doubt ... choose love. You will never regret showing your part of the love. No expectations
My daughter is struggling with the same thing regarding my husband's mother, except they didn't have a bad relationship. She just told me today, however, that she's already had to watch my parents and grandparents die, and she would rather remember her last grandparent vibrant and fun and always on the go, and not go and be confused for whatever random family member of neighbor is the flavor of the moment. I told her I won't force her to visit, but that if she's going to, she should do it now while her grandmother does have memories left and can remember her at all. It's hard, though! Especially if the relationship was always tenuous.",2021-06-13 03:52:22,Fam_Gravenhorst,nyrg7q
Alzheimers,I feel like a monster,"My grandma is in mid-late stage Alzheimer’s, and is mostly bed bound. My mom and aunt take care of her. I’m a 20 year old college student, and I avoid being around her a lot because it’s heartbreaking to see her suffering. Part of me wishes she would pass now, because ‘herself’ is already gone, and I know she’s probably going to suffer like this for years. I feel like a monster for wanting to let her go, or for ‘accepting’ her death. ‘She’ is gone, only her body remains alive. I feel so callous for saying this. I don’t have the natural motherly instinct, I’m not a loving person, I’m very blunt. I don’t know how to care for her. I’m going to hell anyway, I just want to see if anyone else feels the way I do.","What your feeling is completely normal. Please don't feel like a monster for it. I've been at dementia caregiver meetings where someone says ""hopefully the cancer takes him fast"" and everybody just nods their head in agreement. These are common feelings to have in this situation. Big hugs.
Please know you are anything BUT a monster. Every person dealing with this disease feels as you do. Maybe you could send yr mom and aunt out to do something fun (mani/pedi or a movie - whatever they would enjoy) and offer to stay with your grandma for a couple of hours. Then go back to being a college student without feeling guilt. I guarantee your mom and aunt would appreciate the break, and you’d know more abt caring for yr grandma. But listen, whatever you do, don’t call yourself a monster!

Big internet hugs for you. Hang in there!
You’re not alone with these thoughts. I dread calling my Dad because talking to him is so hard and upsetting. It’s the long goodbye. This is a normal thing to go through.
I love my mom to pieces and always have. I, too, often say I wish she would just pass in her sleep rather than to continue suffering with the disease that scared her the most. Per her doctors and social worker, what I feel is very common and it's actually one of the more humane wishes one could think.
Being blunt and not being overly emotional is normal. Not wanting children and not wanting to watch someone suffer is normal. 

I take care of my grandmother who has Alzheimer’s and I can’t even talk to one of her daughter’s because she’s so emotional. She never wants to discuss her dying or her progression, but she also is the least helpful. 

Mothering, emotional, sensitive people have their place in society, but so do we. Hard decisions have to be made by someone and I’m not saying others can’t make them, but while being analytical and blunt can be jarring to some; it’s a good way to be in many situations. 

Don’t put yourself down so easily for who you are. Be glad you’re emotionally accepting of stressful situations.
Wanting her suffering to end, and wanting everyone else’s suffering to end is quite the opposite of monstrous. 

After my dad died, I told my therapist I wanted to be happy as a goal- she told me if I could be happy right then, there would be something wrong with me. That point has really stuck with me. 

My mom has Alzheimer’s, I want her to be done with it too- but I know it’s for all the right reasons. This disease fucks everything up, try not to let it make you question your basic empathy, it’s not necessary. You’re doing your best, try to care for your grandma in a way that you will be proud of years from now- I’m trying to do the same, I’d hate to look back on this time and feel a ton of guilt because of how I handled my moms care
I was about your age when we experienced this process with my grandfather. And I was very much the same way. At the point where he stopped knowing us or knowing what was going on I stopped visiting with the rest of the family. 

I felt sad for him and also wanted to keep my good memories of the man I remembered him being. 

Now I’m nearly 40 and going through it all again with my own dad. He’s already at the point where he doesn’t know us most of the time, can’t really care for himself, and struggles to communicate anything meaningful at all (all the words are mixed up or no sense). My mom was caring for him full time alon for the past year bc of covid and he just got placed in a home. He had a very difficult time transitioning and yesterday was the first time I visited him in about a month. 

It was so hard seeing him like that and I found myself wishing it would go more quickly at this point. 

My mom has been having a very hard time with it so I have basically just focused myself on supporting her. 

This is a very hard experience. Wishing it would end is normal. We all know it will get there inevitably. If only it could be like quickly rolling of a bandaid rather than a slow peel. 

Hang in there. *hugs*
you’re in no way evil or callous for saying that. it’s a very real and common thing for caregivers or family members to experience, especially in late stage. i’m 21 and my Mom has early stage early onset, and it’s so hard to see herself slowly disappear which is why i joined this community. i find that practicing mindfulness and gratitude for just a few minutes every day really helps me avoid those intrusive thoughts.
Frankly, there isn't anything you can do for your grandma at this point. It's an incurable, neurodegenerative disease process.

Let your Mom and Aunt take care of their Mother, and support them how you can.

Yes, it will end in tears, relief and/or guilt and it will be horrible and/or wonderful. I wish I could say something to make the process easier, but I can't.

But you are only 20 y/o coming out of a goddamn pandemic year and the focus of your life should unashamedly be on yourself, college and your future right now.
Like everyone said, what you are experiencing is completely normal. I just lost my mom to the disease in April. The last few months leading to her death, it was difficult when I went visit. She could rarely put her words together. We just sat silently after a while because I felt like I was talking to myself and  I was never a talker. I ended up playing songs by her favourite musicians. What you said about your grandma being gone and only her body was there struck me. I had the same feeling. I am sad that she's gone but I think we said our goodbyes some time ago as the disease took her personality away bit by bit. But I would to think she's at a better place now, and I hope she is finally being herself again. 

You are ok and don't be too hard on yourself.
Not a monster at all. I've had the exact same thoughts about my Mother. She lost her husband of 50 years (my father) a few months back and she has rapidly declined. Between the depression and the mind degeneration she wanes back and forth between sad, anguished crying and hateful, vitriolic outbursts-mostly directed at me and my sister. We try not to take it personal or respond, but it's hard. My Mom is miserable 97% of the time and it's heartbreaking to see. The only redeeming thing I have right now is that I know she doesn't remember the awful things she says to us, and the fleeting moments where she is neither crying nor lashing out.",2021-06-11 22:32:22,killing_carlo,nxwhtw
Alzheimers,I honestly don't even know what to say in here.,"My dad has Alzheimer's and I don't know how I feel.

I'm scared because I don't have kids and am worried when I do, he won't know who I am.  I'm worried that something will happen to him and my mom won't be there when it does.  I'm worried that I haven't said enough to him; I haven't told him I love him enough, I haven't.....But I also feel like I'm being selfish because I'm not the one living with him, my mom is, so why do I get to be upset?  Also what happens now?

I just don't know what to say.  But I'm scared, I know that.  I'm also angry.","Ohh, yeh, it's sad, scary hard diagnosis.   It's complicated, the relations & dynamics between family members.  Some folk lose it slowly-ish, others faster, you never know.   You also, get to be upset, it's very sad.   Idk, you ought to check out alzheimers & dementia .org websites, knowledge about it can help you come to grips with the whole thing.  It's hard.  They have lot of good info & support for the memory lossed and their family / friends / carers.  Ways how to navigate it, help & support yr dad & yr mom still live their best lives possible, deal with the feelings of grief or guilt or anger & whatever.  Take deep breaths, cry if you need, it's never easy.  Everybody deals with it differently.  Enjoy times with yr dad, and support yr mom, while & when you can.  Best of luck!
Just dealt with it, he recently passed. Say your piece to him ASAP. No good way to get through it. 

Problem is we need cures and preventions now!
I’m so sorry you’re having to deal with this.  It’s not being selfish to consider how you feel about all of this.  It’s you, your life.  You’re experiencing it and it’s healthy to be aware of how this situation is affecting you, so you can reach out for support. ❤️

Alzheimers,What can I do for my mom?,"My maternal grandmother is in the late stages of Alzheimers; yesterday we were told she would be gone within several weeks, and today we were told it would be more like hours.
My dad isn’t in the picture and neither are my mom’s siblings; it’s just me, my brother, our adult cousins and their mom. What can I do for my mom? What will she need from us? Thanks for any advice!","Sorry for your loss- Offer to help with anything- time, money, day to day stuff- just be there for her. 

When my dad died, I took on too much responsibility and ended up being the executor of his estate which has been a nightmare- I’m also now my moms primary caregiver (she has Alzheimer’s) and I turned my life upside down to move her in with me. 

I have two brothers and a sister, one brother has completely checked out and hasn’t seen us in two years. My other brother and sister help out here and there, but honestly that adds up to me getting a break once or twice a month. For me, any help or kindness past the bare minimum puts a real smile on my face and makes it easier to get through the next week.

In time, maybe surprise her by taking her out to dinner. Talk about memories of her mom. Sit and watch tv with her, clean her kitchen- any of these things would probably help most people in her situation.
My mom really enjoyed looking at old photo albums and telling me stories about each person. Kept her lively but calm - also we had a bird feeder that she loved watching. I agree with r/blind30 in that your presence is the greatest gift.
Alzheimer’s is so terrible that I’m almost certain that when my Dad goes, my mom will be relieved.",2021-06-11 15:19:21,jandeer14,nxnx15
Alzheimers,Dont know how to handle this (my mom has Alzheimer),"Hi pals.

I just found this awesome group and read some messaged to know if the right place to ask the question that i want to shoot.

My mom has been ""affected"" with Alzheimer, she is 62, but this behavior have started about 6 years ago (she faced some big working issues at the same time her father passed away). Doctos was not sure about the name if this illness because she was very young, and on the beginning was not going fast, and he was just forgetting little things (she has one of the best memories that i have ever seen, she remember the Document of all their clients and the monetary status of each one of them - she was accountant).

  
These days, her manual mobility has been affected and she can not recall normally words used all days, she use to ask the same question over and over again when like 30 minutes have passed... The problem is that she always has been very curios and wanted to know everything.... We have tested with cannabis and with formal treatments, but we see no change.  
My father is dealing with her, by taking her to the doctor when she has an appointment and helping her with daily activities, and managing his business as well.  
I am full time worker  and finishing my Engineer degree to leve the country asap (living in Argentina) and trying to convince my father to come with me.

I have spoken lot of times with my father to hire someone to take care of my mom, or at least some  therapist contention for him, because he is maddest every day with all this crap.  


Do you happen to have some advice for me to push the person who is taking care of her to start with psychologist or something?

&#x200B;

Thanks, and sorry for the long post.

Alex","Hiya!  Yeh, that's a hard situation, sad for yr mum & you & dad, she is so young.   Often the person themselves, and the spouse / main carer can sort of be in (hopeful / wishful) denial for some time.  For many oldies, there is embarrassing stigma with dementia / alzheimers, makes it difficult to convince them to go doctor or to admit they have problems.   Idk how you convince your dad, but like all medical problems, the sooner doctors/specialists identify it & start treatment, the better, for everyone. 

I think there is like a dementia .org / alzheimers .org in Argentina, I found some info (they're called ALMA).  I'm in Australia, but all over the world these 2 orgs have great resources, info, helplines, support for the memory lossed people and their family / friends / carers.  They should be able to help you with some ideas, how to help yr mum n dad.  

Best of luck with everything!
My suggestion is to try and keep her mind occupied (puzzles,books,new hobbies) and to spend as much time with her as possible.
She may have early onset. I'm not sure where you are, but please do try to find a specialist who can assess her. There may be some therapies/drugs that can help her. But spend as much time with her as you can now.  It might not be a bad time to find a caregiver so  she can become accustomed to having them around. 

I am so sorry.",2021-06-11 08:45:59,ALX1S,nxf5by
Alzheimers,No siblings or family to help with caregiving,"Any suggestions on how to get help with caregiving ?    I only have 1 brother who is battling cancer right now so I have to take care of my mother 100% of the time.   I have my own business that I can work from home for right now.  I just get worried that hiring someone my mother will not be comfortable and / or nervous they screw up something with her 15+ meds, etc.

My mother has several medical issues (heart, kidney, etc) and seems like she is ""sick"" with an issue nearly every week.","Only child of a mom with dementia, no other family or friends to help as well.

I'd say home care or placement. In my experience, home care is about $20,000/yr more expensive than placement in memory care, and nowhere near as good care. This may be different in your area. But covid has made all this a lot more of a mess to deal with.

If you're running a business, particularly if you'll be caring for her at home, you probably will not be able to juggle both once the disease progresses, particularly schedule-wise, but it can also destroy your mental health if you're not careful... that's if you try to do it all yourself.

Seek as much help of any form as possible. Look at all your options and decide what is best for the both of you. If the money is there for her, use it. If not, look into medicaid or local programs. Have a team of professionals to help you if possible, and research them to make sure they are working for your mom and you, not just the money.

I would have been completely effed without some of the resources I found to help me understand what I have to do and how to go about doing it to get my mom what she needs quickly. But there's a ton of bureaucratic headaches and waiting for appointments and signing paperwork, etc. Your schedule will not be terribly predictable for awhile. 

Do you have POA? Get it if possible. It will make things easier.

Agingcare is a decent forum and has a good newsletter with great info. A Place for Mom can help you find care facilities in the area. Always tour and look at reviews and health dept reports if you can.

There's also adult day care, but that isn't good for the later stages. 

Saying this is a lot is an understatement. It's difficult in most every way.

ALWAYS be sure to take care of yourself too or you might not be able to juggle it all after awhile. It will be hard to find the time but you have to make the time.
Look up home care agencies in your area. They can be paid though Medicare, if her income in limited.

Alzheimers,Advice on banging on the door?,My grandma with Alzheimers wont stop banging on the door few times an hour all afternoon. Whenever we ask what she needs she’ll just say i didn’t bang on the door. Has anyone else been through this? We give her sleep gummys in the evening and thinking about giving her some after lunch as well. I just worry it’ll affect her sleep at night if she takes a nap in the afternoon. Thank you in advance.,"She might need more things to keep her busy. Fidget toys, magazines, music, old tv shows and stuff like that. Don't drug her just because she knocks on the door. You can also purchase a cheap cam to keep an eye on her instead of going out there. 

Also giving her too much sleep medicine can have the reverse effect and not work at all. Lower doses work best for my dad at night. We were giving him 5mg but now we half that and it works better. We use it on days he seems more restless, but not every night.

Just like most behavior with Alzheimer's patients it will pass.
We call my 84 year old mother a ""rapper"" as that's all she does when no one is around.  We have security cameras we use to keep an eye on her, and if she can get her hands on anything hard (ashtray, teacup, tv remote, etc), she's a rappin - and not gently either.  She's gone through 4 tv remotes.  We ended up taking away the remote, so she has to turn on the tv manually, and then she has one channel - oldies, which she seems fine with.  Her sleep habits are poor, getting up several times a night just to wander or have a smoke.
Similarly my grandma won’t stop opening the front door. We put a screw in the sliding lock so it won’t open and now she won’t stop jiggling it
the last thing you want to do is let her nap during the day, unless of course you prefer to be kept awake all night. is it possible to keep the door ajar/ would that stop her knocking? if she forgets as soon as you open the door could you just ignore it until she moves on? is she able to read/ could you put a “do not disturb” sign in very large letters on doors you dont want her knocking?

Alzheimers,How can I be more kind and supportive of my grandpa?,"My grandpa is 81 and has been progressing through the stages for a while now, probably 5-7 years. (Sorry my timeline is a little screwed up) I’m not sure what stage he’s in but it’s getting very bad. My whole life I had NEVER seen my grandpa get mad, or frustrated at anything. 

Nowadays he’s always mad at people and his communication skills are basically non existent. I go to his house atleast 4 days a week to help with things around the house (and I spend 2 nights a week there for easier commuting) or whatever because i park the car I use to driver for uber at his house.

He does nothing all day except sit in his recliner, or stare out the window for hours. I bring my dog over to his house during the week so he has some company, it seems to have made him a lot happier as he LOVES animals.

Every time I see him it’s always the same basic questions over and over and over..
“Can I get you anything to drink?!”
“You’re going to work?”
“Where do you work?”
“What do you do?”
“Where do you live?”

He has asked me if I wanted a drink 5 times in 1 minute before. And him asking the same question 2-3 times in a minute isn’t uncommon EVERY TIME I GO TO THE KITCHEN TO GET SOME WATER OR WHATEVER.
I often find myself not eating or not drinking because I don’t want to go downstairs and have to explain what cup I’m getting, that I want ice in my water, I’m hungry so I need a piece of toast, just stupid shit.

He will freak out if he sees me outside (which I often am) because he will think I’m a burglar or something. He’s a EXTREMELY paranoid, he thinks people are watching him whenever the windows are open. And he thinks there are burglars EVERYWHERE. 

For example:
A car stops a little bit down the street for more than a minute. OHNO OHNO THEYRE GOING TO ROB US CLOSE THE WINDOWS!!

I guess the part I need help with the most is how to deal with the constant questions. He never understands my answers, I have to explain things more than you would with a 3 year old, and then if he miraculously understands me, he just forgets 2 seconds later.

Today absolutely broke my heart...he was telling me some simple story in the most complex way that my dog heard my car and knew I was outside. I said “oh haha yup” and walked in the other room because someone was calling my name.
He then storms in the other room yelling about how I’m so rude and I walked away from him before he could finish talking.
“Grandpa I heard you”
“Oh ya?! Then what the hell did I say?!”
(I then repeat what he said word for word)
He then says 
“No you didn’t hear me say that because I didn’t say it yet!!!”
*extreme anger 
“Grandpa then how did I know what you were going to say?”
*extreme confusion
“I dont know...”

Please any words of advice or encouragement would help a lot. I’m struggling so badly seeing the one vibrant, interesting, loving grandpa who was more of a father to me than my father ever was.

Going to work everyday knowing I’m going to have to see him like that breaks my heart. He’s hardly the person he used to be and watching him deteriorate right in front of my eyes is agonizing. But I know I can’t just put him in a home and forget about him.

Thank you.","Do you have a plan for how to direct small talk? If the usual routine is to sit and have a conversation, but you aren't sure what to talk about, he's maybe going to fill all the gaps himself, and he will fill them with the loop his brain is stuck in.

You need to redirect the conversation. Talk about pleasant things and put on pleasant music and tv shows.
I just repeat basic answers over and over. If weird ranting or paranoia happens, I agree and change the subject to memories that are easier to get to like childhood or teen years. It helps give them focus and the bonus is that you might get to hear interesting stories.
Have you read up much on what happens to the brain with Alzheimers, and what to expect? You're right, it is totally heartbreaking, but I think having some understanding of what is going on, and what's normal to expect with the disease, can help you to be a little more patient with the endless questions. He likely doesn't remember what he just said two minutes ago and is just trying to be polite. It doesn't make it any less annoying, but it does make it easier to cope with answer the same thing a million times if you can put yourself in his shoes a little. 

He literally can't form new memories now, even if he wanted to, and probably can't recognize familiar things. Imagine how terrifying that would be- to know enough to know you should know where you are and how to do basic tasks, but no longer be able to do them. But you can't ask for help because... well you've probably already forgotten what it is you needed help with. Of course you'd lash out in anger sometimes, or get upset, because the alternative is admitting how much you're forgetting, and that's terrifying. 

Middle stage is awful because they know enough to know they're loosing their memories, but not enough to be able to develop coping mechanisms. 

Try to separate out your feelings about your grandfather as father figure from your feelings about your grandfather with alzheimers. They are the same person, but also not, and your grandfather is suffering a horrible disease. Care compassionately for the person who's suffering, and remember it's not him, it's the disease, that makes him lash out and ask the same questions over and over. Then take time when you're not on caregiving duty to grieve the loss of your father figure. 

Look up the caregivers forum on a website called Alzheimers connect- tons of great tips on there for caregiving strategies, and it's much more active than this sub. The alzheimers association also has an app with lots of suggestions for caregiving strategies, and a 24 hour hotline if you really need help and advice in an emergency. There's also a book called 36 hour day that's... well honestly kind of overwhelming but it has a ton of good info. 

Also, I know you didn't ask this but gently? Can I suggest that you may want to prepare yourself for the reality that as your grandfather progresses, he will need more and more care, and at some point, it will pass what you (and possibly your grandmother) can provide? I used to feel similar to you about not wanting to put my mom in a home, but the reality is that for her, and for us, moving her into memory care was absolutely the most compassionate choice we could possibly make. She's surrounded by professionals there who are specifically trained in dementia care, and we can rest assured knowing that she's safe and her needs are met round the clock. I go to visit her often, and now I can focus more on being her daughter, and on the good moments together, and less on the frustration of round-the-clock care. 

Sending compassion and strength to you- it's an awful disease to watch
This is the nature of the disease. You can’t argue or reason with them because they cannot process or retain anything. Better to just repeat your answers and make them comfortable. Unreasonable to avoid getting food or water because just you don’t want to answer repetitive questions, it will be like this for years",2021-06-09 05:23:24,PaIIow,nvrjrb

Alzheimers,Seeking help hiring live-in caregiver in California,"My 74 year old mother has alzheimer's and has been living with me for about a year and a half. I work full time and take care of her when I'm not at work. We have a little outside help - just enough to barely scrape by. Her needs for care are increasing and my availability isn't. I want to find a live-in caregiver to assist her full time 5 days a week. l am having a very hard time finding out how to get through all the red tape of minimum wage/overtime/sleep requirements. Agencies charge too much, I want to do a private hire. If you live in California and have a live-in caregiver, please message me! How did you figure out what to pay them? Are you following the rules or doing cash under the table? Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.","I'm not an attorney, but, for what it's worth, I would strongly recommend not doing cash under the table. Also, I think one of the reasons agencies are more costly is because they're handling payroll taxes, social security, benefits for their employees. We decided to go with an agency, because there's no way I/we want to, or have time to, handle that end of things, even if we do it through my parent's accountant; then, we'd also have to pay accountant fees.
I actually have a similar question from the other side.  I want to find someone I can stay with and exchange living for care (not grace care but more being present, food, medicine monitoring, appointments, etc.  Looking on MT near friends so if anyone answers about private process, let me know!

Alzheimers,US approves first new Alzheimers drug in 20 years,,,2021-06-07 12:25:33,Kagedeah,nugp1n
Alzheimers,FDA Grants Accelerated Approval for Alzheimer’s Drug,,"link to a relevant discussion on reddit medicine: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/nuexg4/the\_fda\_approves\_aducanumab\_the\_hotly\_debated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/nuexg4/the_fda_approves_aducanumab_the_hotly_debated/)

A lot of skepticism from healthcare workers on the front lines.

For what it's worth, I think aducanumab works (marginally), but it's far from a wonder drug and Biogen hasn't provided **convincing** proof that it works.

* For Biogen, the approval is a license to print money.
* Also, the FDA is giving ""conditional"" approval for the drug, and Biogen needs to perform a ""confirmatory"" clinical trial to more convincingly demonstrate that the drug is effective. If you read some of the comments on r/medicine, you'll see that some people think that Biogen will take their sweet time in completing the confirmatory trial (because it might fail) and spend as many years as possible raking in the $$$$ while they wait for the trial to be completed.
I approved this post out of all the others as it links the official [FDA.gov](https://FDA.gov) site. Here is an article I found helpful with a little more discussion of the conditional approval and what it means.

Alzheimers,How to talk to dad about seeking early treatment/testing,"He’s been way more forgetful then normal lately and I think from my perspective I’m feeling more sure about being some form of Alzheimer’s or dementia. I think it would be inappropriate to not take action. 

But I have no idea how to have the conversation. Any articles, YouTube videos, books, or personal experience that you found helpful that you could share would be immensely appreciated.","I think this interview is very helpful the couple did a lot of research early on in their alz journey and explain a lot here[interview, how helpful it was for them to start seeing specialists and participating in trials from the beginning [link](https://youtu.be/53HOTNAXh0I)
I don’t remember how I asked for my mom to go in, but it got to the point where she recognized it and her mom had it so I mentioned right after a forgetful moment “I’ve noticed recently you’ve been more forgetful that usual and I’m going to book an appointment at the doctors just to make sure everything is okay” I had also considered calling her doctor and asking for the doc to recommend a check up and then have a look
My dad is required to have a doctor appointment and retest for his drivers license. If there’s any such requirement where you are that could be a reason to see a doctor.
One thing you could point out, as well, is that early diagnosis would be important, because there may be a medication (Aricept) that might help delay onset.",2021-06-07 09:38:20,Hereforwhatthisis,nucrd7

He’s going for a memory test soon and I’m really worried how he will react. He’s always been super independent, in charge and in control. He will not be able to drive soon and going places with my mom is his only hobby. Are there any resources or suggestions to help deal with the impact of this diagnosis?","Hi I have EOD. I recommend finding a support meeting online here are spme links 

https://www.dementiaallianceinternational.org

These groups are focused on living with dementia rather than dying with it. If online doesn’t work the Alzheimer’s Association depending on your chapter may do something in person.

Best of luck
Can’t endorse joining a group enough! Also you may want to talk to an elder law attorney as you may need a power of attorney to assist your father going forward.
I took caregiving classes through my local agency on aging - they were very helpful learning the stages and how to help your loved one with alzheimers. Also made me realize how I could not do it on my own. My mom is in a wonderful assisted living home now - but she has no short term memory. Luckily she still knows me.
36 hour day is overwhelming but incredibly helpful

Alzheimers Association has been invaluable- they run support groups all around the country (which I highly highly highly recommend) and have a 24 hour hotline you can call for advice

[https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=topics&f=151](https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=topics&f=151) is a great source for advice and support

Alzheimers,Is it wrong if I don't want to go see my dying mom?,My mother is dying of dementia. She fell and busted her head open and they don't believe she is waking up. She has maybe hours to a couple days left. She is 5 hours away from me. I have watched my mom fade away slowly over the last 8 years and when we put her in a home I hugged her saw her smile for the last time and I told her I loved her and told her goodbye. I feel like my mother's spirit has been gone a long time and I don't want to see her like this. My extended family is trying to tell me that I should but I don't know..is it wrong to feel this way? Should I go?,"As long as you have someone else you trust looking out for her to make sure her care and comfort are provided for so she doesn't suffer.  Don't just trust her to health care workers, they have too much going on to make sure that she is not in pain, struggling to breathe or is anxious or seizing.
Do what feels right to you.  And learn to tolerate the discomfort of what others may think.  It’s your life, not theirs.
If you have said goodbye and don't want to go see her, you dont have to go. Only you know what is right for you in this situation, don't be guilted into something that is wrong for you.
Only you know what's best, but once you decide, there are no take backs. Can you live with yourself? That's the true question.
It’s not wrong to feel the way you do. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

With that said, I think you should go. The last thing you want is to have any regret. I’ve seen it happen way too often where loved ones who don’t show up say they live with that guilt. 

Obviously not everyone is that way, and you can’t make your decision based solely on that. At the same time, as a caregiver I’ve sat with people whose loved ones didn’t show up and watched them pass. If I wasn’t there, they would have been alone. To me, that breaks my heart. But it’s those moments that do make you stronger.

So you have to make the difficult decision as to what matters to you, what you think you can handle, and what you can live with.
If it were me personally I would go. That being said, if you were my relative and took this approach I wouldn’t hold it against you. My uncle passed recently from a 5 year stretch of cancer. He lived well past any projections we were originally given and thus we had all grieved and moved on mentally. He did not want family there for his final hours. We obliged and attended the funeral.
I was with my dad when he passed.  He lingered for days until his brother came to say goodbye.  His brother is a raging alcoholic and I didn’t really want the additional stress or to smell him in my parents small house.  Even though Dad wasn’t conscious or “with it,” it seemed like Dad let go after that visit.  
You know what is best for you and your situation, and how your extended family are.  I got away from my extended family right after the funeral lunch was finished.
For a long time during my grandma’s illness I felt that she wasn’t actually there. But when it came time that she was going to pass on, I couldn’t bring myself to leave her side. To me and in my experience, she was in there. She could hear, she could feel touch. She on some level was aware I was there. And for me there was no way I could not be there with her. Everyone’s situation is different, and there is no shame in what you choose to do. But ultimately I thought about what she would have wanted before the disease appeared. And my grandma would have wanted to have her family around her, and it felt like if that was all I could give her I would. I wanted her to have a dignified death, or at least as dignified as can be considering it’s what she would have wanted.
I missed my grandmother's death while away at university. My family told me not to come home. At that point, she was like an infant who couldn't walk, talk or eat properly. I hated visiting her as she'd disappeared years before (14 years of the illness after official diagnosis) but felt guilty for not visiting so I'd visit when I came home from uni. Every time I said goodbye after a visit, I wasn't sure if it'd be the last. 

I recently expressed guilt and remorse at not being there for her last moments and my sister said it was horrible and I shouldn't feel bad. For my mother, she needed the closure of being there. We experienced the grief and final goodbye in different ways. My grandmother died peacefully, but it was a sad and painful experience for us 
as this was a proper death as opposed to the slow, undignified death of the 14 years prior.

It may sound selfish, but it depends on you and how you want to say goodbye. You may find years from now you wished you were there, you may find that you wish you weren't. This isn't a noble last act of keeping someone company as they die so they're not alone. She won't know you're there, but you will and if that's too much after the trauma of the last 8 years, that's understandable. If you being there is one last step on a painful journey, then that's ok too. 

I will say that if you have immediate family who will be there, then they may need your support even if you're not willing to be in the room when your mother passes. I'm sorry you're going through this.
This is one of those situations where there's no right or wrong answer. My dad had a stroke and a brain tumor was found. I spent every day sitting with him in the hospital and then the respite house because my mom's Alzheimer's required her to have constant supervision. I ended up quitting my job because I was taking bundles of days off unpaid. I was there when my dad died. I was the one making all the calls in terms of his healthcare needs, and it wrecked me.

Years later, my mom's still in the mid-stages, maybe starting to show some signs of late Alzheimer's. Facilities in my state were woefully unprepared for rage and anger, so she ended up being moved out of state. I'm now hours from her and my last visit with her was fantastic. I get where you're coming from as my last memories of his dad were him panicking that he'd been moved to a hospice house to die. He had to be sedated during that move. My mom was laughing as she got into the ambulance and telling me she loved me and would see me soon. I kind of like having that be the memory I cling to after.
I was in this situation with both of my parents and one of my wife's parents (all cancer). We were planning an extended visit in a few weeks to have them take a turn for the worse and then we/I have to drop everything and fly out now. I wouldn't make this trip again, and the only extended family feelings you need to worry about is your kids. The last trip I made was when my wife was in her early stages of Lewy bodies and her mother went into hospice care. The whole week her local siblings made snide remarks about us not getting there in time and of course my wife fixated on this, while constantly getting lost in the facility.

If I was in this situation again, I would ask a local family member or even pay a stranger to face time with the loved one and the extended family.

I know this sounds cold, but in my humble non-professional opinion the only thing to be gained is your emotional well being and if you don't want to go, then don't.
So many people get wrapped up in just a body. Because like mentioned your mother’s spirit has been gone. Do what YOU feel is right don’t let anyone guilt you into doing something that’s uncomfortable, but ask yourself will you be okay with your decision years down the road. Think of it that way
Thanks so much for posting this. I’m dealing with the same thing with my grandmother. Your feelings are valid
It sounds like you've already done your grieving, and I'm not sure if your family is saying you should go for you, or for her - but if it's for her, and she's likely not going to even wake up, and might not even survive your travel time or recognize you if you go and if she's still alive and if she wakes up, eh, I dunno.

Culturally, there's this notion that we have to be there to see someone die to get closure. But the flip side is that I think if we watch someone die, there's the risk that we'll get trauma from that, PTSD and the image of them dying gets burned into our brain and haunts us, and that replaces our good memories of them. I'm not convinced, if that's a concern you have, that you living with decades of that to sit with someone who likely won't even be aware you are there, is a sacrifice you should morally have to make. 

Maybe there's a middle ground, a way to ask a hospital social worker or hospice worker if there's a way you can record your voice reading a favorite story of hers, that can be played quietly next to her bed? Or a playlist of favorite music you know she loves. Something to comfort her on her way out, if part of her brain is still aware of surroundings, without you physically having to be there.
I watched my mom slowly die for about 8 years. The day before she died I visited her and just watched her sleep. It was hard, but I didn't feel like I was looking at the woman who I knew. This was somebody else, this was a disease that had taken my mother from me. I don't think you should feel bad for the choice of not seeing her. I know I was split on if I want to see my mom or not. In some ways I'm happy I saw her, and in more ways I'm not. Since this post was made 23 days ago I'm assuming this is already happened. Hopefully whatever way it went down you had your opportunity to grieve properly.",2021-06-06 12:14:42,Lilsnoww,ntp8vf
Alzheimers,Why is my mother not on any medications for AD? Aunt elected for hospice care...,"My mother ended up in the hospital last weekend and was released Monday to my aunt's care. She has power of attorney and decided hospice care would help with costs. Met my mom's caretaker today and went through meds. Zyprexa, tramadol, and lorazepam are all she's on. Every 4 hours and they want to increase to every 2. Pretty sure they're trying to kill my mother. Anyone else have any experience with these meds or situation?","To be accepted into hospice, it has to be likely that the patient will die in the next six months. By that late stage Alzheimer’s medicines do little if anything, and there are often side effects like diarrhea. For the most part Alzheimer’s meds slow down the disease for a period of time. My mother has had AD since 2015. Like many people, I don’t know if the medicine slowed the progression or not. AD is relentless. Mom is stage seven now. Barely walks and talks, doesn’t know her family, can’t feed herself, and gets agitated at times. I love her dearly. I moved into her house a year and a half ago so she could stay at home. My husband and I care for her. We do everything we can to keep her safe and happy.  We are focusing on quality, not quantity of days left. That’s why we entered hospice in February. Hospice does pay for her medicine, a hospital bed, a wheelchair, and some supplies. They also bathe her three times a week and help me watch for bed sores. They have added medicine when Mom cried for hours wanting her mother and also took care of her when she got constipated. They have taught me how to move her and help her feel better. They have been wonderful, and I know they have helped make my mother’s final months more comfortable. 
Hopefully that is what your aunt is doing. Maybe you’re in so much pain that you can’t see the bigger picture yet. I don’t know your situation. As another daughter though, I feel your pain and I hope your family can find peace.
It all depends on what stage she is. My dad was on Alzheimer's meds for a couple of years then stopped. He hasn't been on them for about 6 years. 

Putting her in hospice care doesn't rush death. It is meant to make sure she is more comfortable as the end is nearing. You don't get to choose hospice. A doctor has to sign off and I think a hospice doctor also has to approve it.

Have you had a discussion with you Aunt  about your mother's care? 

Everyone's experience with Alzheimer's is different. My dad and a neighbor were diagnosed at the same time. My dad is going on 10 years and our neighbor died only 4 years in and she had a great supportive family caring for her at home like us.

Have a discussion with your aunt about your mother. This stuff shouldn't be a surprise if you have open communication with your mother's care team.
I have experience as a caretaker and usually if she’s on those medications she must have really bad sundowners. Most family’s DONT want their loved ones so medicated I’ve even seen most use cbd drops instead of medications. Also I must add hospice is a HUGE help and almost like a lifeline for most families they give out a lot of free supplies and really do help it’s not a bad thing if anything hospice should be taking a lot of the stress out. However I know this isn’t always the case
Sounds like they are more trying to make her comfortable rather than help her live longer. When I aigned my medical POA I had two choices. Live longer regardless of pain or have Care make every attempt to keep me alive. Perhaps she chose to be made comfortable and this why they are doing what they are doing.
My mom definitely took a turn for the worse after a hospitalization, so it is possible that whatever put her in the hospital triggered a decline in her mental condition as well.

Mom isn't on those exact drugs, but she is on a pretty potent cocktail of very strong meds that you generally wouldn't want someone on. And here's the thing- in a normal brain we wouldn't want her on such strong meds, but she needs them. There are no drugs or treatments for Alzheimers disease; all you can do is try to treat the symptoms and make the person as comfortable as possible as they progress through the stages of the disease. The truth is that some of the symptoms of middle-late stage Alzheimers are really awful, and sometimes powerful antipsychotics are the only thing that help.

For us, Mom was having frequent seizures and horrible hallucinations causing her to become angry, violent, and paranoid. Those powerful drugs with nasty side effects are lessening her suffering and making it so she can get through the day without thinking her caretakers are trying to murder her and kidnap her children. And we are looking at getting her on hospice care soon. Not yet, but soon. Because while she does have good moments and good days, she's also suffering horribly, and more often than not now, she's checked out and gone, or crying and afraid, and in those moments even the things she used to love don't bring her back.

To an outside observer, it probably does look like we're trying to drug her up and shorten her life, but to us, that are seeing the day-to-day caregiving needs and how much she suffers, the choices we are making are absolutely the most compassionate decisions we can make for her. I can't tell from your post- are you involved in day-to-day care for your mom, or taking on more of a supervisory role? If you aren't seeing her day-to-day, it might be worth talking with her caretaker to get a better picture of why they believe the drugs are necessary, and what they're experiencing in caring for her",2021-06-05 21:40:07,nmh881,ntanx8

Alzheimers,In Home Hospice question,Does anyone know what one can expect from Medicare when it comes to in-home hospice.  Right now we have a day-aide and a night-aide.  Up until now my parents were able to use walkers to get to the toilet.  While they needed assistance to use the toilet they could stand up and turn around and sit down as needed (even if it was with a bit of help and/or coaxing).  Now they are both completely unable to stand up.  To get them up there needs to be one person on each side holding their arms  to prevent them from falling down.  This have become practically speaking bed-bound.  I think they are now ready for hospice care.  It's impossible for one aide to care for them as they used to be cared for.  Does anyone know what kind of assistance Medicare Hospice can provide?,"Hospices vary. Contact them in your area to get answers. You can choose if more than one. Covid might make a difference too. Don't wait too long as they can be helpful. We had a nurse come once a week and bed bath 3 times a week. They also provide diapers mailed to you and other misc. They will need to evaluate your case.
Have you tried using a bedside commode? Hospice should be able to provide and really help your family through this. I would also maybe look into getting a caregiver as well to help",2021-06-05 17:06:38,Fsilverstein,nt5ea7
Alzheimers,Looking for advice on explaining to my grandmother as to why she's in memory care,"My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in June of last year. I had started taking care of her last February when she couldn't remember how to pay her bills or order her groceries online anymore (she had stopped driving 2 years earlier as she didn't feel confident operating her car any longer.) She was calling me at all hours of the day and night, so I was able to submit a claim to her long term care insurance and began in-home care for her 8 hours a day, every day to help her with food prep and remind her to take her medication as she had missed doses for about 3 months but wouldn't admit it. 

I found a care facility that offers memory care, and the place is lovely with really great staff. She moved in in December, staff says she's really flourishing. However, she frequently accuses me of ""imprisoning her against her will"" which is frankly untrue, she signed all the documentation to move it, visited with me multiple times before move in, she's even the one that asked me to find a facility in the first place. Now she's saying that she didn't sign anything, and that she doesn't belong there. I know telling dementia patients they have dementia isn't the way to explain things to them, but my dad snapped at her and told her she has dementia to which she replied that she wanted to see documentation of the diagnosis that we procured without her seeing a doctor. I explained to her that she did go to the doctor and I was there with her when she got the diagnosis. 

Mostly I'm looking for advice on how to counter or change the conversation when this happens. She really believes in her heart that I've locked her up and that she was doing just fine at home ""by herself"" and that her diagnosis was falsified by me, which wasn't at all the case. I don't know what it is about the situation but I always end up crying when she lashes out and says I ""should be ashamed"" of myself. I know I did what's right for her, but I still feel guilty and I want to be able to have a conversation and relationship with her.","Tell her she can go home when the doctor says she can. And that you’ll ask the doctor in the morning.
This is a really hard transition. I’m so sorry it’s happening. More than likely, it will pass, but of course you want to preserve that positive association as much as possible. Sometimes things go in certain directions that you have no control over and are not because of anything you did wrong. But here are some things to consider.

Your grandmother has a whole new community of people who will spend day and night with her. You know her best as she has been your whole life, and they will get to know her in a very different way. Dementia can make a person very different than they were. It may be hard if it gets to the point where her new community of people seems to know her “better”; but putting that aside for the sake of the relationship, it will be crucial that you become part of her new community and allow them to help you know her as she is now. 

There is usually a point person, maybe a social worker, who is the primary point of contact for families. But they will not know her the same way others will. Some people you will want to know:

— All facilities have an Activities/Quality of Life/Enrichment department. These individuals are in a unique position to build a close relationship with your grandmother and can help keep that bond between the two of you. 

— Get to know her consistent CNAs. They are some of the most important people in your grandmother’s life. They will see her at the “worst” and help her be her best. 

— The chaplain/pastor/priest/ spiritual support person is an important source of “all-around” emotional support. Even if she’s not religious, they can still help. 

These are people who can work with you to problem-solve. You are on the team. They will find things that work to redirect her if she’s upset, or engage her to prevent it in the first place. They are the ones who will talk to her about you, answer her questions about you and your family, and comfort her when you’re not there. Some things will work based on who she has been her whole life; while other things will be new and unique, and even unexpected. 

My team supports the spectrum of behavioral health needs at my facility. Even a short family visit can require attention to a lot of details. They may need to get her up a certain amount of time before the visit in order for her to be ready and comfortable. Sometimes they will take 2 hours with a resident to make sure they don’t feel rushed during care, and have plenty of time to choose an outfit, etc. If that’s the case, maybe an 8am visit would require too much rushing. They will know what times of day she may be able to best enjoy a visit. For example- if ending a visit is difficult, they may coordinate with family to wrap up the visit right before a favorite activity is starting, so it’s a natural progression from one positive thing to the next. Where the visit takes place can make a difference- some residents respond better outside, or in a quiet environment, etc. (This is in the event that the person can’t tell us their preference.)

Anyway... all this to say, I strongly recommend that you work with the facility staff to find the best ways to respond. Just remember that it may change over time. But your grandmother is still “in” there and I’m sure she loves you dearly.
My mom is just like this and also says the diagnosis was faked. I no longer try to explain. I start visits with a sweet treat and then immediately suggest we eat it in the courtyard or one of the Rec areas. Being out of her room helps. As soon as I see her figit or start to talk negative I have us move to another area, such as checking the dinner menu or activity schedule.  I basically redirect every ten mins. I also try to go about an hour after a Seroquel dose .
I want to send you a hug. It’s so hard when the accusation turns on you. We tend to take the mick out of my Nan and she responds to that. So I’ll say something like ‘everyone was concerned about you because you were forgetting things so the doctors have you here to make sure you are well. Lady of the manor you are with all these people to help you! I had a weird day at work and someone…’ etc. I also go for distract as a comment above said if the lady of the manor thing doesn’t make her laugh
Honestly? Embrace therapeutic lying

Part of the awfulness of the disease is that most dementia patients don't realize how much help they need. Back when Mom was still living with us, she would cry for hours in the morning asking to go see her family and forgetting how to use the shower, and then insist in the afternoon that she was perfectly fine and healthy and didn't need any help at all. 

You'll have to experiment a bit to see what works, but you can try things like ""mom, we had to do some renovations on the house and it's not safe to stay there right now. You're going to stay in this hotel for a few nights and you can go home when its safe"" or ""you're right mom, it's really awful to be stuck in an unfamiliar place! I'll call the doctor tomorrow and ask when you can go home."" Basically- validate the emotion of fear at the unfamiliar, let her know you're taking care of it (which you are. It's just that you're taking care of it in the way she needs rather than the way she wants) and then provide a distraction to change the topic.
I was just at my mom’s talking to another resident. She asked if the currently empty rooms are guest rooms. I said no- you know how at college you have dormitories and sororities? This is like that only for older folks who don’t want to live by themselves. I could see that explanation really resonated. with her. Then she said “well I guess I need to decide how I feel about this place or should I find something else. “ (note- i am the daughter of another resident/not employee.) i said - absolutely! if you don’t like it here you should figure out what you do want and talk to your family - there are lots of places, you just need to find the right one. Reality- I don’t think any place is great when you are just trying to find your independence. I just punted to make this up but it really calmed and empowered this person. Hope it helps.",2021-06-05 18:11:04,callhersavage,nt6rzu
Alzheimers,Should I be concerned for how my mom treats my grandma with dementia,"My moms finds it funny to tell my grandma that her sister died. She just repeats it a bunch of times. My grandma talks abt moving back to her home town and my mom doesn’t want her too- so my mom will tell her that the senior living hone she wants to move to caught in fire which is kinda harsh. She will also tell my grandma that her friend from her hometown died.. my mom said she does this so my grandma stops talking abt moving back but my mom seems to find it entertaining / funny and I think she wants to see my grandmas reaction  . My grandmas friend and sister did not die but my moms says it as an excuse for y my gma can’t leave and than my mom laughs 

My mom is with her all day so I’m sure she’s stressed sometimes & I guess with dementia my grandma will forget anyways- but it’s just obnoxious of my mom

I guess my grandma can be a handful but my mom can just start getting snappy and being like “remember I told you 1000000” times today to my grandma","This sounds like abuse. Your mom isn’t actively trying to provide the best level of care and quality of life for your grandmother, regardless what she actually thinks she’s doing. There is never any valid reason or excuse to mistreat someone with dementia; I don’t care how stressed a person is or how frustrating it is, you simply cannot punish or take it out on the person who is suffering from the disease.

I am willing to give your mom the benefit of the doubt and assume she’s never dealt with this disease. That would explain things like saying “remember I told you,” which is something you shouldn’t do. But finding humor in telling someone that their loved one is dead is just cruel. Are there things that your mother does right? Are these the only shortcomings or issues you’ve noticed? 

It wouldn’t be a stretch to assume things will get worse as the disease progresses, meaning that your mom will likely mistreat her even more. I would suggest looking into outside help via an agency or private care. At this point, you sound like your grandmother’s only advocate.
Definitely abuse, I would recommend you suggest her mom getting a caregiver to take the stress off of her.",2021-06-04 23:09:58,hahasa88,nsmb3j
Alzheimers,10 years later,"Never realized my dad was losing anything cognitive wise. He’s always been straight forward and on point until a couple months ago. He told us (mom and I) he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2011. He’s degraded physically pretty bad the past few months. 
All I’ve got to say is watch out for your parents/grandparents",,2021-06-05 00:16:23,PuzzleheadedRhubarb5,nsnf10
Alzheimers,I dont know what to do,"So I'm 14 years old and my dad has alzheimers. I'm keeping an eye on him this morning because my mom is at work. A few minutes ago he started whispering ""I just wanna die"" over and over again. I guess he didn't realize that I was nearby and could hear him until I asked if he wanted to watch a different show. I'm freaking out and I dont know if I should tell my mom or not. I feel like it would break her heart and make her feel like she isn't doing a good job as his caretaker. She does so much these days and is always stressed out, I really dont want to make things worse for her.","Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.  You should tell your Mom; don't keep things in and burden yourself even more.  She's the adult, you're the child.  She needs to know so she has all the information she needs to make the best health care decisions for your Dad.  Please tell her.

I wish you peace.
I am so sorry. First, this is pretty common. My mom has spent years saying she just wants to die. She's asked me dozens of times to help her kill herself. I am pretty certain if your dad had the cognitive reasoning skills that slowly disappear, he'd feel horrible that you overheard him. 

Chances are high that your mom always knows he makes comments like these. The saying ""it's the disease"" doesn't always help as much when you're hearing it, but it's the reality. If she hasn't talked about therapy for both her and yourself, I recommend finding a family support group or therapist who specializes in the emotional strain caregivers of dementia and Alzheimer's face.

I will also say this, and it's the same thing I said to my brother when he tried to talk us into having his 14-year-old to be my mom's caregiver when he was at work. I knew my nephew didn't want that role. It was tearing him apart. Don't do that. Be honest and talk to your mom about how hard it is emotionally. You're not a quitter or less caring if you can't handle it. I've spent enough time in therapy to know now that my mom being with trained Alzheimer's nurses and aides is far better for her and me.
Is your dad on anti-depressants? It’s a common side effect of Alzheimer’s, and my dad also talks about not wanting to wake up in the morning, but is massively better with the medication to lift his mood.
Peace and love to you and yours. It’s important to tell her because it’s very important to know if people are showing signs like that. Break it to her gently probably reassure her you know she’s doing a great job in a challenging situation beforehand. Maybe then start by asking if she’s heard him say anything about wanting to give up, or something like that. And discus what you heard him say.
I'm so sorry you're going through this. My grandmother used to say the same thing when she lived with us for the first 6 years of her diagnosis. I was about 8/9 when she started saying things Iike that and when you're in your formative years, it can affect you badly because you're not sure if it's true and what the hell you're supposed to do about it. 

My siblings and I would do whatever we could to make things easier for my parents. Any fights ended when they got home, we did our homework on our own and did our chores. Something that definitely helped was talking to the adults when they got home and telling them some of what happened. We didn't tell them everything because we didn't want to upset them, but we told them the scary/serious things. My grandmother would say and do the same disturbing things around them as well, so it was easier to talk about it. Now, as adults, we've talked about those early years of Alzheimers with my parents and learned that as much as we kept some things from them, they kept a whole lot more from us. 

You can't protect your mother from this. You're both living through this, no matter what you try to do to ease her burden. Withholding information when you're a kid and not the adult making decisions doesn't help either one of you. Talk to her. She needs to know, even if there's nothing either one of you can do about it. Talking to your immediate family, especially the ones you live with, can really help with communicating what you're all experiencing and helping you realise that you're all dealing with your father's Alzheimers even if it's in different ways.

In terms of therapy, there are physical and online Dementia and Alzheimers support groups for caregivers. If there's not one physically near you, there will very likely be an online group of people in your region that are going through similar things to you. It's free and can help provide you with information, but also support in a time when your family is likely not socializing very much.
this resonated with me strongly. i’m 21 now, but my Mom got diagnosed when i was 17 and has said suicidal comments to me many, many times over the years. everyone’s situation is extremely different, but you should let your Mom know what’s going on, and hug your Dad when he says things like that. most people don’t deal with this issue before the age of 30, so it can be especially tough as a teenager. if you ever want to reach out my DMs are always open
You're a wonderful son!!!!! Take care of yourself too.",2021-06-04 12:13:52,spicericelice,ns8uhs
Alzheimers,I Don't Know If This Is The Place To Talk,"My grandmother and my great aunt died from Alzheimer's. 

My aunt has the genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's, so I wanted to know if I did. 

I do. 

I have borderline personality disorder and major depressive disorder. I am fully aware of how I will probably start to behave once I start going downhill. (If I start. I understand that a genetic predisposition does it mean you'll definitely get it.)

I can't put my daughter and my husband through that.

I want to set it up so that I can get physician assisted suicide if I am diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It is not legal in my state.

Does anyone have experience with setting this up or helping someone else set it up? I just have some questions about it.","Maybe slow down. You have no idea what treatments will come and what laws will change between now and some possible future.
This depends on where you live if this is even legal or not (USA.) Bring it up with your doctor. Be prepared to push your wishes. Good luck.
This sounds like a conversation you should have with your husband, so he knows what your wishes are.  Beyond that, I agree to slow down and see if you even get it, and if you do, what treatments are available at that time.  There are more and more breakthroughs for it.  You can also check into research studies, to see if there are any you could participate in.
I agree with other comments to talk to your loved ones about your wishes.  I have done so regarding a history that may lead to dementia (from injuries/trauma via an accident). 

I also tell anyone that will listen to make sure your family is absolutely on the same page with you and supports your wishes, preferably in writing.  If a relative disagrees with any of your wishes, the doctors will not follow yours in the case of life-saving measures to be taken or not. 

I hope you have consulted a physician and have their diagnosis’s done support as well.  Best to you.
Oregon resident here. Oregon's and Washington's respective laws require state residency. Prove it with a voter ID, state drivers license, or lease agreement. No minimum residency period is specified.

I highly recommend ""How To Die In Oregon,"" a beautiful, compelling documentary that tells the story of several patients in various stages of the process. When asked for their last words, one thanks the Oregon voters for passing the law. Another says, ""If I'd known it would be this easy, I wouldn't have been so scared."" It will answer some of your questions. 

Wishing you peace and good health.
Hello. First, let me say how sorry I am that you are going through this. I do hope that you are working with a mental health professional to help you process this news. I work in the end-of-life space so I thought I would provide some information. 

Medical Aid in Dying is not and most likely never will be an advanced directive (allowing another person to advocate on your behalf if you are not able) in the US. The process is 100% patient-driven from request to ingestion. All the laws in the US require the patient to have decision-making capacity and a terminal diagnosis and expected to live less than six months (similar to hospice enrollment requirement). Since Alzheimer/dementia patients often remain physically healthy but with diminished-capacity they do not meet the eligibility requirements for aid in dying. There has been some progress made in ""Alzheimer's advanced directives"" and if you Google that phrase you can connect with an organization that can give you more information about all of your options.

Alzheimers,Advice please?,"Hi all,

I was referred here by a mod from another sub. My mum was diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's on Monday. We're all still trying to come to terms with it. She's only 52 and while I'm glad it isn't anything worse I'm devastated that this is the diagnosis. Being so young she's being referred to clinical trials and she's starting a supplement strongly recommend by her neurologist called Souvenaid. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to cope with it and how to help my mum as best I can. My 1 y.o daughter and I live with her and my dad as well as my sister. 

I appreciate any advice that you guys may have for us.

Thank you 💕

Edit - I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented.

Mum and dad have an appointment to get POA sorted on Thursday. We wanted it sooner but mum just wanted to digest things first.
I'm already in therapy and I had a session two days before the diagnosis. I'll be having another session shortly.
I'll be asking our GP (he sees both my parents, my mum's mum, myself and my daughter) if he can offer therapy as an option to mum.
I'm going to try and get her access to the NDIS which is a government disability service in Australia. I'm already on it with my mental health.
My parents are lucky to be able to afford things as we need it. My dad has inherited money from a couple of relatives who passed and as morbid as it is I'm beyond grateful he did because they're going to need it. The Souvenaid is about $1300 a year alone. 

This is taking a toll on everyone. Lots of tears were shed as we'd all hoped it was from the trauma of losing our family dog in 2016 and her having a car accident in 2019. The more I thought about it the more I realised this diagnosis was a long time coming. I noticed the changes in 2016, but again just chalked it up to our family dog passing away because she was in her late 40's still.

And for everyone who has had a loved one or has a loved one with this I am so sorry you've been through or are going through this or both ❤️","My mom was diagnosed at around the same age. It’s a long, hard road. Good for your family for being so proactive about getting the diagnosis and getting her into some clinical trials. 

Get documents in order now, such as power of attorney, advanced directives, etc. As hard as it is, ask your mom about her wishes (e.g., cremation, burial, body donation). It’s good to have all of this set up well before you’ll need them. Also have her make a list of all of her financial accounts, logins, passwords, etc. 

Your mom could consider applying for disability if she hasn’t yet. My mom was so disabled at the time of her diagnosis that she was immediately approved based on her neuropsych report. 

Speaking of neuropsych, if she hasn’t had one yet, try to schedule a full neuropsychological evaluation. It’s nice to have a baseline eval so she can monitor the progression of the disease in the next few years. They may include this as part of her clinical trials. 

Therapy is good, if you need it. I went to therapy during the extremely stressful time of putting her in a nursing home. It helped so much in dealing with all of those emotions and guilt.
I’m sorry to hear that - my mom also has early onset Alzheimer’s. I really cannot recommend therapy enough. I hate to have to say it - but the battle just gets harder and goes downhill. I’ve felt a wide range of emotions while seeing my mom suffer and therapy had been a god send. I’ve felt everything from anger, hatred, love, frustration, sympathy, annoyance, etc. and honestly sometimes feel all of those emotions within a couple hours. 

My advice is to look into resources now as opposed to later when you really need them. Look for aging and elderly services near you and they can almost always point you in the right direction. There are resources out there but they take a lot of time and paperwork and it’s better to just get things moving now when it’s not as super necessary. 

This subreddit has also been great. I love all my friends dearly but they do not understand (and I hope they never do) what I am going through watching my mom turn into a shell of a person. It is very helpful to surround yourself with supportive people who understand the feeling.
I'm so sorry your family is going through this. My mom had early onset Alz and was diagnosed in her mid 50's, although we believe she was hiding her symptoms for a few years before her diagnosis. She was diagnosed in May 2013 and lived at home with my dad as her primary caregiver. I would come to their house twice a week to help out while my dad was still working. After about 4 years, it was no longer safe to keep my mom home alone while my dad worked, so  we hired a lady off [Care.com](https://Care.com) to watch my mom during the day. This was a huge help for all of us. We moved my mom into a memory care unit in a nursing home in May 2019 because my dad's health was clearly declining (she was waking up all hours of the night and he was exhausted). She declined pretty quickly in the nursing home and passed away in October 2020. My advice:

* For your own well-being, please consider therapy. You will experience a rollercoaster of emotions and talking to someone can be very helpful.
* See an elder law attorney to help prepare a last will & testament and POA. My dad was my mom's POA, but I became her representative payee since I take care of my parent's financials. 
* If you are in the US, have her go to the social security office and apply for disability (SSDI). Your mom will be able to start collecting social security and Medicare early. 
* Have someone else take care of financials. We had to go to the bank and take my mom's name off the accounts. 
* The mental and physical decline can be gradual, but it will be helpful to get a schedule established for taking care of her. After my mom was diagnosed, it was no longer safe for her to drive, so I took on responsibility of taking her to appointments and grocery shopping. 
* It is never too early to discuss funeral arrangements so you don't have to worry about that down the road. 
* If she is able, have her write down stories from her life that your daughter can read when she's older. 
* Get a ring doorbell or motion activated camera to monitor her if she is left alone.
* Be there for her. Patience, patience, patience. I cringe looking back at all the times I would get frustrated and say to her ""remember?!?"" or ""you already said/did that!"" This will be hard on all of you, but be there for one another and take it one step at a time.
I'm so sorry. I'm almost your mom's age and to be diagnosed at this age is terrifying. My mom was in her 60s and I thought that was bad. One thing about the treatment plans today is that it can work almost too well. I hate saying it that way, but we're into the 11th year of this and I am so burned out. When they decided my mom's rage was too dangerous and that she needed to be moved to a facility equipped for Haldol injections, which meant going out of state, it's given me a tremendous break. In the process, I learned I have severe anemia, which they think may be dietary as all other tests are coming back well. I'm focusing on no more rushed meals and takeout and cooking from scratch again. I recommend not losing track of your own health. It's easy to do as your mom becomes more demanding. Others have mentioned support groups. They're important, too.
1. Souvenaid is on Wikipedia, if you'd like some information on its efficacy.
2. I've been giving Curamed (mfd by Terry Naturally) to my husband straight through mid-stage, it's a form of turmeric/cucurmin that is supposed to help with memory/brain function but also inflammation/pain.  Can buy it at Amazon or local health food stores.
3. Get in touch with your local Alzheimer's assocation.  
4. A dementia caregivers' support group has been extremely helpful to me.

Good luck, and blessings on your family.
My suggestion would be to read through this subreddit. There’s a lot of helpful information and questions here. Good luck and my heart goes out to you.
Seek counseling now. Like now now, as the stages progress you will want that outlet. Anyone involved in the process if able should talk to someone. There's no shame in it, this disease is hard and carries a heavy burden. My mom benefits from a large family, but staying social and engaged in the goings on around them can be very beneficial to those with alzheimers. Don't be afraid to take time for yourself through this.
It is so so early. Poor Mama. Depending on her health, it can end up being a really long time before she gets to the point of stage 7. 
Hide /move her assets … get her name off of everything. People told us my parents could:should get divorced. That way if she has to go into a long term care he won’t go bankrupt. I’m so sorry. I’m in year 10 with my mom. She is simply a person in a chair they feed now. There is nothing there. Alzheimer’s is horrible .
Hello. My dad was diagnosed when he was 57. He is going on 60 and a lot has changed, but he still laughs, has fun, travels (pre-COVID), and exercises. I would say that what helped me is spending time with him. When im away from him, thats when my mind wanders and i panic. When im with him, its almost as if it were back to normal. I try to speak slower, elaborate more clearly, and just be patient. Its easier for me to adjust for those things than for him to try and act like his old self. When i speak slower, it gives him a chance to process what im saying. Also, dont google things lol. Everyone is different. I was so afraid that by this time, it’d be worse than what it is now. 

in the beginning, it was bad. I was crying every waking minute of every day.  Then gradually you deal with it better.  Read the “ball in the box” analogy for grief. We are in a horrible position because we grieve for someone who is still alive. It hurts so much. In the beginning, my dad kept saying “why me?”  One day something clicked and he started saying “why NOT me?” I dont even know if that helps. But it is something that makes sense to him i suppose. 

Sorry if this post was all over the place. It accurately describes my thought process lol. 
Much love to you. You can do this. For her♥️",2021-06-02 01:08:46,jamie_jamie_jamie,nqdzwl
Alzheimers,Need internet safety and boredom tips.,"So my dad has Alzheimer’s. He lives with my mom and they take care of each other, but his short term memory and decision-making abilities(which he never really had) are completely shot. Last week he asked me to fix his computer because it seemed to have viruses.  I got the computer, and sure enough it was full of malware because he’s been going to very shady porn websites, and just clicks on whatever he sees. He also was friends with a ton of bots/scammers on social media and has been chatting with them. Finally, he has been going to hook up sites to try to meet strangers. The rest of his time he spends reading fake news designed to make people angry (think Qanon.) 

Unfortunately talking to him about safety doesn’t work, he agrees to whatever we say, but then just does it anyways once he’s alone. We don’t want to take his computer away, because that’s all he does with this time, and that’s basically how he spent all day every day for decades. My mom doesn’t know much about computers and is overwhelmed, so she’s not really able to keep track of what he’s doing.

So far we’ve taken away his access to mom‘s financials, and I installed some antivirus and monitoring software so I could block the most dangerous looking websites. I also blocked the bots on his Facebook and changed his settings so only mutual friends can send a friend request. I made my mom the administrator on his computer so only she can approve program installations. Monitoring all of his Internet use is exhausting and distressing, but it doesn’t seem safe to let him roam freely at this point. 

Any tips about Internet safety for people with dementia? Also, I’d love to get him off browsing the web, but he says he’s bored and that’s all he likes to do. Any ideas of activities/hobbies for someone that loves intellectual stimulation but is losing his intellect?","Can you put some ""parental controls"" on the machine?  That should eliminate a lot of the shady porn sites.

I bought my husband a new Chromebook around Christmas and he can't get into it - even though I simplified his password and keep it on a post-it note right on the keyboard.  Yesterday I heard him on the phone talking to someone and when I asked what it was about, he had seen something in an AARP publication about computers especially good for elderly people.  I pointed out that I didn't think he is a candidate for a new computer.  Hopefully, by now, he's forgotten all about it.",2021-06-01 12:42:43,SyntheticRose,npycm5
Alzheimers,Pressure on FDA to start ruling on AD treatments,"FDA is supposed to rule on Biogen's treatment around June 7th. I don't believe Biogen's treatment, aducanumab, will receive FDA approval on the next round due to too many gaps in, and too small a test population in its current phase testing. I, however, strongly believe that Cassava Sciences' (SAVA) treatment will get approval because of its test population and continued track record of safety and efficacy. However it goes, these treatments will continue to put a spot light on Alzheimer's Disease and the FDA's need to work with these companies to get to a result in the near term. AD is the next pandemic and treatments must be viewed as critical solutions.","I think you're right about Biogen, even with the Alzheimer's Association's strange push of support for no apparent reason I think it does not have the data to back up an approval

Alzheimers,UK residents with family or friends in care homes,"Hi there,

I'm a 27 year old who (along with my sister) have been caring for our father who has suffered with early-onset dementia for several years now.   


I have been looking into the two week isolation period for residents that has just been scrapped by the Gov for 'low-risk' visits. This is obviously very welcome news, as I can't imagine my own father having to undergo two weeks of isolation when he is as ill as he is.

Abstract...

Background: In 2015, a patient in hospice with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was treated with ionizing radiation to her brainusing repeated CT scans. Improvement in cognition, speech, movement, and appetite was observed. These improvementswere so momentous that she was discharged from the hospice to a long-term care home. Based on this case, we conducted apilot clinical trial to examine the effect of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) in severe AD.

Objective: To determine whether the previously reported beneﬁts of LDIR in a single case with AD could be observed againin other cases with AD when the same treatments are given.Methods: In this single-arm study, four patients were treated with three consecutive treatments of LDIR, each spaced twoweeks apart. Qualitative changes in communication and behavior with close relatives were observed and recorded. Quantitativemeasures of cognition and behavior were administered pre and post LDIR treatments.

Results: Minor improvements on quantitative measures were noted in **three of the four patients following treatment**. However,the qualitative observations of cognition and behavior suggested remarkable improvements within days post-treatment,including greater overall alertness. One patient showed no change.

Conclusion: LDIR may be a promising, albeit controversial therapy for AD. Trials of patients with less severe AD, double-blind and placebo-controlled, should be carried out to determine the beneﬁts of LDIR. Quantitative measures are needed thatare sensitive to the remarkable changes induced by LDIR, such as biological markers of oxidative stress that are associatedwith AD.

Alzheimers,Alzheimer’s and Aggression,"Hi all, seeking some help or just opinions/experiences y’all had with dealing with family member suffering from Alzheimer’s and aggression.

My dad has Alzheimer’s for almost 2 years (could be longer, but it was officially diagnosed about 1year and 9 months). Lately in the last 2/3 weeks, he’s been a lot more aggressive (Cursing, shouting, spitting out food, swinging and lashing out at family and the caretaker). This is especially a lot more often when trying to bathe him or wash his face. But otherwise, it seems like every other minute he’s hissing, snarling and yelling out his intent to “kill you all”(in his words)

While I’m not too concerned about his murderous intent, it’s more of him lashing out (think punching, scratching etc.) at the caretaker that I feel is unwarranted since she’s not a family member.

He keeps this up throughout the day till he eventually sleeps. And it tends to get worse at night, where he acts out and tries to escape. He’s in a geriatric bed with a safety vest with a harness to ensure he can’t get out but still allows for mobility. (He’s a fall risk since he has trouble with walking and has fallen before, when we didn’t have the bed then and lapses happened during the night when no one woke up to support him when he does his nightly walks, when he could still walk around alittle)

It’s getting to the point where it’s affecting the lives of everyone since even though he’s in the bed with the harness, at night he screams out every other minute..etc. And no one ever sleeps well and it affects me and my brother since we tend to miss meetings (even from home, thanks to covid) or things slip up at work due to exhaustion (I was recently given off from work to get some rest, which is ironic since I hardly ever am able to sleep at home even if I’m given off) since we spend hours just trying to pacify him. Mum is a non factor here, as she left our lives a long time ago.

Sorry for rambling, but the point I’m trying to state is to understand how peeps are coping with aggression and Alzheimer’s and also, if we send him to a home. How do they deal with it? Do they sedate them? (Is it even ethical to do so, laws might differ country to country) 

My brother is not too comfortable with that, although I did tell him it’s a case of “ignorance is bliss”( to a certain extent). If you don’t know, you will probably remember him in a better light rather than tainting your memories of him with his lashing out and violent outbursts.

Would greatly appreciate your input here, thank you all. Dad is currently taking memantine for Alzheimer’s and quetiapine for his outburst.","I'm not sure tying him into bed is the best way to deal with his restlessness.  It would make me pretty angry!  Maybe more rigorous daytime exercise (walks, etc.) could eliminate some of his night-time restlessness.  I'd certainly discuss meds with his doctor.  He may also be having some depression and that can cause aggression, especially in men.  An antidepressant might help with both mood and sleep.  

An alternate way to prevent night-time roaming is better locks on all the doors, and a buzzer or alarm system when the doors are opened.  

If he were institutionalized, they would have a locked facility, and some type of medication to calm him down might well be used.  I don't see anything unethical about that.  By now you need to get a medical power of attorney so you and the doctor can make decisions without your father's consent - or even knowledge.
I just wanted to say that I’m so sorry you are going through all of that and I can relate. My mother is a very aggressive person with dementia and she is very paranoid and unstable on her feet.  She is a fall risk too and fell just this past Saturday on the stairs. I think that you are well within the range of “it’s okay” to send him to a care facility. In fact, I honestly think that would be the most humane thing for yourself, your brother, and your grandpa.   We all need sleep. It’s critical for our own health and development.  It’s no joke. Put your family members first.  But when it comes to being able to do that, sometimes we have to make tough choices for what is best for all involved.",2021-05-31 00:02:16,Arylx_,noszyf
Alzheimers,Pixar’s “Coco”,"My mother, who only turned 65 a month ago, is suffering from stage 6 Alzheimer’s and likely has < 12 months before our final farewell. 

I don’t know if it’s good or bad, but the Pixar movie “Coco” has been on my mind recently. Ive been listening to the soundtrack with my family (especially. 2 young kids) and Remember Me… man.. is there any song that is both depressing and hopeful at the moment?","Oh damn. Yeah, this film broke me. My mum is 63 and had to move into a care home earlier this year when she became absolutely terrified of her sister (who aside from me was her primary caregiver), didn't recognise her home as somewhere safe and was becoming increasingly scared and frustrated and was on the way to refusing care from everyone. 

Another film that really got to me was Kubo and the Two Strings. It's not really to do with Alzheimer's or anything but there are some moments near the start of the film that felt very relatable because of what caring for my mum has been like. I highly recommend it, though if you're anything like me you may need to have some tissues handy when you watch it. 

I'm so, so sorry to hear about your mother. I know there's nothing I can say that will make things better but I hope you're doing ok and looking after yourself. I know how tough it can be.",2021-05-31 04:23:33,OxD3ADD3AD,noydln
Alzheimers,can you all give me the signs in your experience of the early stages ?,"my grandma has been changing recently. she is 73. she’s been getting a bit confused, mixing up words, having panic attacks/intense mood swings out of nowhere, rocks back and forth, shows behavior of paranoia, and said she hates the evenings. 

i’m not sure if this relates to alzheimers, but i’m trying to consider all options. i don’t really know what’s going on. this has all happened in about 1-2 months.","There are many different types of dementia, so it is important to get a professional diagnosis so you can manage care appropriately. What you are describing is not generally categorized as early stage, it is somewhere closer towards the middle. (Keeping in mind that the disease is inconsistent and there are lots of non-linear good & bad days.)

It sounds like your grandmother is distressed so whether or not it is Alzheimer's, getting her treatment for the anxiety & panic attacks is important and may help address the rocking and paranoia. The sundowning (getting restless & generally worse in the evening) can also be helped through medication and/or routine.

Edit: Wanted to mention, since you noted it was a sudden decline, that it might be related to another medical event, for example a stroke or surgery, that is causing gradual symptoms to become more pronounced. Basically, yes, the symptoms you're describing could be alzheimer's, but could be a lot of other things too, and most likely they'd need to do an MRI to make the determination.
for my mother (early onset ~62 years old) the first sign was that she began having trouble with tasks she used to have no issues doing. this included driving, various normal activities at her job, and overall short term memory declines / increased confusion. additionally she started having trouble using technology like her iphone or the computer even though she previously was good at it. hope this helps and best wishes
Thank you for caring enough about Grandma's well-being to be concerned about these changes that you're noticing. I know how scary it is, & that the uncertainty about the best ""Next Steps"" is difficult to mentally surmount. I think, truthfully, the symptoms you are seeing, whether or not they are dementia related, are clearly distressing to Grandma & to those who love her & are witnessing this decline. As many other wonderful commenters have said, there are a number of illnesses or conditions that can cause the symptoms you're describing, & in my opinion, the action plan for Grandma needs to be getting her evaluated.

 If it IS dementia, the earlier the intervention, the more time your family may have to plan for her ongoing care. If it isn't, the speedier the diagnosis, the quicker Grandma can be treated accordingly. I have never heard anyone say ""I regret taking my Loved One to the doctor sooner rather than later""  in this circumstance; oftentimes, we hear the opposite - that people regret not reacting sooner when they started noticing significant changes. I'm sending your whole family strength & courage as you embark on this journey. Please let us know if there's anything we can do to support y'all. Xo
It could be dementia, although I would request bloodwork. Make sure they are checking everything, B12, Blood Glucose, etc. My grandfather recently passed away from Alzheimer's, but was clearly suffering from something else that exaggerated his progression.
Years before diagnosis, my grandma suddenly seemed to forget how to drive. She would sit in the drivers seat and look around like she didn’t know what to do. We took her keys away, and that was about it for several years. We brought her in for diagnosis when she started to repeat questions
My grandmother was in her mid-late 80s when she first started showing symptoms. The most obvious was repeating the same things verbatim every few minutes. Here are the less obvious symptoms in her case:
1. She started buying weird things, like blankets, a rug, and a painting because she kept thinking someone was coming over (they weren’t.)
2. She forgot how to put gas in her car. She would always ask us to “show her how to use that gas pump”. At the time I assumed she was just confused by the technology, but in reality she had forgotten how to put gas in a car.
3. One thing that sticks out the most to me is that she would stick her fingers in food. Like sticking her finger in cake icing and licking it. This isn’t necessarily weird, but it was out of character for her.",2021-05-31 09:15:10,throwaway-19923,np35nz

Alzheimers,mother has early onset,"Hello, I am 21 and currently live at home. my mother has been diagnosed with early onset ALZ. I am going to university about a hour away, and am moving in with my boyfriend but planning on coming home to work and stay with my family every weekend. My mom is 56 and it has been terrible for my family coming to terms with this and watching her change with nothing we an do. She can no longer wash her hair properly and can't drive, she also doesn't paint anymore, and that was her passion. It hurts me a lot being with her because I notice that she isn't the same mom I grew up with. I feel really bad being away from her too though. I am really worried about not being home as often and missing the good parts of her life, as we don't know how quickly this will progress. I am just so scared and don't know exactly what to do. it has been causing me immense depression and anxiety as well as mental breakdowns. Does anyone have any advice, or have been in my situation as a young person who has a young parent with ALZ? I feel like I can't talk to her or my family about it because they're all going through it as well and are equally as upset, if not more. I don't want to hurt them more. I am also fearing that I will get this horrible disease when I am older but I feel guilty for thinking about myself right now.","My best advice is, don’t feel guilty for thinking about yourself- your family doesn’t just need you, they need the best version of you they can get. So take care of yourself first, do what you can to keep yourself as happy and stress free as you can be- it’s the best thing for everyone. 

Also, I find it definitely helps to talk to family members about this, even if it’s tough at first. My brother, sister and I have been through a lot with my mom, and we’ve made sure to talk about it every step of the way. One of you might have a different idea or approach for some of the issues that come up- and sometimes it feels good to tell funny stories of stuff that comes out of our mom’s mouth these days.
Therapy.  I get it, you could use it, too.
Hey, I’m really sorry that you’re going through this. I’m 30 and my mom’s Alzheimer’s started showing up about 5 years ago when she was a bit younger than yours, and my sister is now your age so I get the fear, anxiety, and depression that comes with it. I can say if you aren’t in therapy, try it out for yourself. It’s been doing something for me, nothing can make you feel the same as before but it helps. Also recently looked into support groups and was told this has been beneficial to others. You have to have people to talk to and cry to about it. Holding it in just adds to what already feels like such a shitty situation. 
I understand the fear of getting this when you’re older and it isn’t something to be ashamed of or to feel guilty about. It’s a very real and genuine fear, especially when you see it manifest in front of you. I’d say you should seek the advice of a doctor, make sure you are taking care of your health, taking all the supplements and dietary nutrition to keep your body and mind healthy, stay physically active, reduce stress and toxic people from your life, and take care of your mental health. I’ve been considering genetic testing to see if I carry the gene, at some point you may want to. 
Came upon this when reading about the genetic testing, so there is hope: 
“But not everyone who has one or even two APOE e4 genes develops Alzheimer's disease. And the disease occurs in many people who don't even have an APOE e4 gene, suggesting that the APOE e4 gene affects risk but is not a cause. Other genetic and environmental factors likely are involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease.”

Just learn to prioritize yourself and mental wellness, especially if there are others who are older and can navigate this better and make decisions. So sorry that this is happening. You can message me if you need to talk.
Our moms are the same age. Take every opportunity you have to be close in a way she remembers. It's sounds strange but my mom used to play with my hair to get me to nap as a kid. I'm a 30 year old man and I will go over and lay my head in hear lap and she will play with my hair and it's like going back in time and being a child again. Also record every happy moment, I have so many short clips of my mom laughing, laughing seems to alzheimers resistant to a certain point. Frustration will happen, the more you take on the worse it gets, don't take it out on her but shouting at the moon and telling the universe its a little bitch can definitely be a cathartic experience.
> I feel like I can't talk to her or my family about it because they're all going through it as well and are equally as upset

They probably feel exactly the same way and are afraid to talk to you as well, so all of you are in the same boat and that is why you should definitely talk to your family members. Communication is always better than sweeping things under the rug.  

When my mother got Alzheimer’s, my sister and I supported each other, and it was such a comfort to have someone to talk to about it. I don’t know how else we could have gotten through that very stressful time.
I was 24 when my mother got diagnosed and she was 44. i was 10 hours away at school - i ended up coming home. i would like to say it was because of her - a part of it (i was burned out & i just left my fiancé). that was 21 years ago - we went to the best Drs. - it was so rare back then.  my mother passed away at 51. i chose to stay home & help take care of her before we had to put her in a home. My brother wanted nothing to do with it, he was married & starting a family of his own. He took her to 1 breakfast & watched her 1 time alone. I asked him how  he could just detach emotionally & physically? He told me seeing mom like that made him sad & he wanted to remember her before she got sick. i resented him for years, for completely checking out! it wasn’t until I was a little older, that i was able to see the situation differently. we all deal with grief differently - me choosing to be her caregiver didn’t make me a better child. The bottom line for me is ... i have to make decisions i can live with and so did he. 

**my brother & i were 4 years apart & never got along- we never liked each other or respected each other - he was a stranger and one i didn’t want to know. 5 years ago when my brother was 44, he was recently divorced & moved in with my father. My dad told me he started seeing signs that my brother could be sick. we took him to a dr & got him genetically tested. our family carries psen1 gene it’s autosomal dominant (meaning there is 50% chance with each offspring). my father couldn’t handle it & so my brother came & lived with me. here is the silver lining - we were strangers - my boyfriend didn’t even want him in the house because he had treated me so poorly - however we both noticed a change in his personality. he was a different person - kind, loving and decent. i spent those last few years getting to know my brother - loving him. What was the most difficult to see — his children, they didn’t come around, didn’t call, his ex-wife not helpful - they said they wanted to remember my brother how he used to be - not when he was sick. my brother died at 47. 

** when i was with my mother & brother i had to learn to live for the moments. :) if you ever want to talk - please email me, i am also in some good facebook groups.

**what was helpful for me was meeting people my age, that had a loved one with early onset. i can’t tell u how many 50 plus year olds would talk about loosing someone in their 70-80’s. i sympathize with anyone losing a loved one at any age. all i could do is just stare at them and wish i was loosing someone in there 70-80’s. i was jealous of the almost additional 30-40 years. i grateful i found support",2021-05-28 20:14:20,Shot_Challenge_9492,nnbap8
Alzheimers,Is it okay to let a loved one know they may have alzheimers?,"My mom, 80+ just recently is starting to act a little strange. My older brother noticed this too, during Conversations with her on the phone. Last night she wasn't answering her Alexa and she always did in the past. So I called her phone. She said she heard two women talking and didn't understand them. So she said she wasn't going to answer the Alexa.

I determined it was a TV program she was watching. The Alexa device rings loudly and announces my name. Yet she apparently didn't understand what was going on.

This is the first time I've noticed something like this with my mom. She had always known how to work that thing and had never been confused about anything.

My dad had alzheimers so now I'm thinking maybe she is developing it. I had mentioned to her that maybe her memory is failing and that my brother noticed same thing. She thought it was funny and said she didn't know why she got things mixed up. But it sounded like she was a little sad that I mentioned something like that.

My brother never wants to be honest and tell people they may have issues. Did I do wrong to mention to my mom that she may be having some memory issues?","You can tell her, it might make certain decisions easier if you can take care of things now before it gets worse.  Get a power of attorney immediately.  Good luck.
I struggle with this, too.  Mom has alz and I don't want to tell  her but she's all too aware that her memory is failing her so I don't feel like I need to add to that burden.   Keep an eye on her and maybe have a chat with her Dr about some tests that they might be able to do.
Yes talk to her, stay away from saying dementia until a Doctor diagnoses it though. Talk about noticing ""short term Memory loss"", or a change or decline in cognition/thinking, or that things she used to do easily seem harder now. Convince her to see her Doctor, then get her doctor to refer her to a clinical neuro-psychologist or a neurologist that specializes in diagnosing dementia.

Encourage this by talking about medications that if started early in the process can significantly slow any decline in function.
Thanks all. Today again during the day, I called her twice. She answered fast and sounded okay. My brother and I will monitor her as close as we can, and see how she is doing. But yeah, I'd like to get a doctor to run tests ASAP.

My dad suffered thru ALZ and dementia. My mom noticed it on my dad, and asked us to listen to him to see if something was going on. But the doctors didn't do a dang them for him. They just said he had Parkinson's / ALZ / dementia. He passed away in a nursing home, not knowing who we all were at the end. He was a very smart guy who served in the military in the 1950's and had his own electronics repair shop.

My dad's sister, also recently passed from the same condition, and was in a nursing home.

After seeing both of them go through this, I was hoping my mom on her side of the family would not go thru it.

But the local small town doctors around where my mom lives, don't do anything to help. They just say ""yes you have parkinsons/ALZ/Dementia"", and try a drug and that's it.

What's scary is that knowing this is probably genetic, and I'll get it someday! I'll be going on 50 soon. I'd like to live with memory intact for another 20 years or so. 

I read up on these diseases, and don't understand why it's so hard for the medical industry to find a cure for it. They can't find medicine to take the ""plaque"" away in the brain?",2021-05-28 05:34:38,,nmu1ds
Alzheimers,Alzheimer's and wills,"My mother is trying to make some changes to her and my fathers will.  My father is in a nursing home these days.  She is being told that without his signature she can't alter any part of the will that was signed originally by the two of them.  They are just saying ""you can't change that"".  I believe she has power of attorney since he's in a home (he obviously would just leave the home if he had the power).  So I don't understand how they think he should be able to sign legal documents.  

Has anyone else gone through something like this?  I realize this is more of a legal question and you can't really give actual binding legal advice, but maybe we are just missing something.  I wish I could talk to this lawyer myself but I don't want to cause any problems or incur any additional fees.  

Thanks!","NAL, but recently had to have my mom sign her will and here’s what we experienced-

I have two brothers and a sister, my father passed a few years ago without a will. My mom didn’t have one, so we spoke with her elder care atty to set one up. 

The attorney suggested we do a standard will splitting my mom’s assets four ways between her kids. My younger brother hasn’t helped care for my mom financially or otherwise, he hasn’t even seen her in two years now, despite living just 20 minutes away. 

I told the lawyer this, and asked if there was any way for us to adjust the will accordingly, and the answer was basically yes, and no- if my mom stated that those were her wishes and signed the will to that effect, fine- but because of her diminished state, my younger brother could sue and claim that we coerced her into leaving him out, especially since she lives with me. They said it’s possible the court could rule in his favor in cases like this, so we left the will split 4 ways. 

We did the signing with the lawyer over zoom, and I wasn’t allowed to be in the same room during the signing, which makes sense. We had a family friend sit with her to guide her through it. 

I have power of attorney for her, and I don’t pretend to understand it completely, but I can easily see how if I went and changed her will (if that’s even possible) it could definitely be contested in court. I know right and wrong, and I definitely believe my brother at the very least should lose a portion of his inheritance equal to what should have been his share of caring for here these past few years- but legally, this is HER will, not mine- and she just doesn’t have the presence of mind to navigate how she’d like her will broken down. 

I don’t know if any of this info helps you, the only thing I can think to suggest is have your mom sign a separate will for her own wishes, which would cover only whatever assets she’s legally entitled to. 

Trying to change the will of someone with Alzheimer’s would absolutely require consulting an attorney- I’m sure you could find one who would give you a consultation free of charge",2021-05-27 00:20:12,axiom235,nlzdpc
Alzheimers,Spaghetti,"Has anyone done the spaghetti and meatballs similar to the spaghetti and hotdog thing?

Wondering the best way to do it. My gma likes spaghetti and meatballs, but she does not want to use her spoon/fork/spork on certain days.

Depends on if she is good with messier food. My dad oddly enough does better with utensils and didn't do well with cumbersome food that may fall apart. He does forget to pick up the utensils sometimes and we have to remind him.
My mom hates hot dogs, so it wouldn't work, but I had a friend years ago that used to make spaghetti pie. I've made that in muffin tins so that it can be handheld once it's cool enough. https://www.spendwithpennies.com/spaghetti-pie/
Depends on how much effort you want to put.

Im italian my solution would be doing this.


https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/meat-and-poultry/spaghetti-carbonara-arancini/


You can do the italian way where spaghetti and meatballs doesn't exist(its an american invention) and you do Ragu and pasta and Arancini from it. Or you could do a core of meatball surrounded by pasta, i imagine the end product would look like a Scotch Egg.
Maybe try a different shape of pasta? Same taste but easier to pick up with a fork or spoon.
We chopped the spaghetti into small pieces and changed to a thick meaty sauce. Mom could eat it with a spoon.",2021-05-27 00:55:44,KcirdnekC,nlzwzl
Alzheimers,How do you tell your relatives that they should stop working?,"My grandmother has early stages of Alzheimers disease. She is a lawyer, but I am concerned she can no longer handle cases. I tried talking to  her about quitting , but she is very adamant that she can still do it. I don't want to stop her forcefully, but at the same time she can't even organize her documents properly also mixes up reality and dreams. Can you please give me any advice on how to handle this situation? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but also there is a high chance that she screws things badly.","Contact your state's bar association for guidance.  When it becomes a potential serious problem for others and your LO won't listen to you or takes things personally, it's time to go over their heads.  In my mom's case, she never stopped looking for work even when she was let go so it's possible she may never willingly stop.
In my mom's case, she left the door to the store where she was working unlocked and forgot to close the safe and set the alarm. She was handed a note the next day that she could silently  retire or be fired and have all of her co-workers know. She opted to retire. If she's working for a firm, talk to the partners and ask for their insight. They may be aware of mistakes she's making and looking for a way to nicely get her to resign.
You may have to have her declared incompetent.  We just went thru this at work.  One of our managers was declared incompetent by the court.  We had to let him go (thank god he’s rich).  The children of our manager went to court because the parent was 1) driving (very bad accident); 2) making bad financial decisions, etc.  maybe contact the Bar Association and see what the procedures are, or get a lawyer.  It’s a terrible step, but what is she gets sued and someone wins and she loses everything?
My wife was a senior level executive. When she was let go from her last job she was adamant about applying for new jobs. But, she couldn't complete her unemployment forms herself. Given her career, she interviewed for some very impressive positions. One - A large non-profit was looking to create and open multiple community banks in our town. Her initial interview went from a planned one hour to half a day. She kept meeting more senior executives at the non-profit and was a serious candidate for the position. I had to drive her to the interview, in an area a few years earlier she could have drove to without directions. My wife is now in the middle stages, she gets lost in the house, is confused what to do with her used toilet paper, can't turn on her computer, etc. but still talks about getting a job.

What I am trying to say is your grandmother doesn't know how bad she is, and she is going to use her coping skills and make excuses until someone stops her. She is not going to get better and should be stopped now. It will be painful to stop her and if she is like my wife, she will say and do some of the most vicious things to try to protect her world.
I think you've gotten some really great advice here.... You don't want this to get to a situation where the State Bar get involved, her reputation is then at risk, and she has to go through a proceeding through them. It's not fun. She is only hurting herself and her clients by continuing to work.

Alzheimers,What should I do?,"Can I suggest to my grandmother's doctor that he check her for dementia and Alzheimers? She may not be far along, or perhaps she is just aging (she's in her 80's), but I'm terribly worried about her.","Assuming your Grand-mom’s primary care physician specializes in geriatrics, they should be well equipped to administer the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) or something similar. It can easily be done with a normal checkup or physical. 

Additionally, screening for additional neurological issues and evaluation of combinations of prescriptions that could cause dementia like symptoms. 

Sounds like your Grand-mom may still be able to have conversations with you and make some decisions. If that is the case, I would discuss with her that you’d like to go with her to the examination.
If you're worried, bring it up with him. Dementia/memory loss is not just a normal part of aging, despite being seen as such for so long. If you've noticed a deterioration, the best thing you can do is get the doctor to check it out.
You can, if you take her to an appointment, you can slip them a note. But be aware that due to privacy laws they may not be able to share the results with you.

So consider the order you want to do things in. Does anyone in the family have power of attorney for her medical decisions if she's incapacitated? That person will need to have access to her medical info. Get that sorted out first, and bring the papers to the doctors visit - unless of course she has a visit already scheduled in the next few days and you're asking because of that.
You can share with her doctor -- that's not a violation of privacy laws. I talked to my dad's healthcare provider and they listened and  added the assessment to his next regular appointment. In some states, I've read doctors have discretion to share dementia diagnoses with family -- this did happen with me. They could only legally share this info with his next of contact Dad put on his medical forms. 

I read some articles about how to tell if it's just normal aging or dementia and he always came out on the side of normal -- I wish I'd trusted my gut because it was early stage dementia. Good luck! I hope your grandmother is OK.

Alzheimers,Alzheimer’s caregiver support groups?,"Has anyone joined one, do you find it beneficial? I searched for support groups near me and there are a few listed on the alz.org website.","Yes even just beneficial in the way that you know other people are going through it. I can talk about it with my friends but none of them really understand (and I hope they never do)
I went to one that was for caregivers and adult children of those with alzheimer's/dementia. I actually found it was really helpful. It just let me know I wasn't the only one that was dealing with this and gave me some amazing resources. They gave these little business cards that you could give to restaurant workers/nail salons and such that said something like, ""Thank you for being patient, my person is suffering from alzheimer's dementia and may be confused by simple requests."" 

Definitely try and find one and check it out. I wish there were more. I moved states and there isn't one here that is convenient.
More than happy to provide support in anyway. Feel free to DM me if you ever need to rant or support! Currently helping my grandma with Alzheimer’s as well
I haven't joined an in person group, but there are some on social media like this one and several on facebook.
Can someone please link some online ones, I feel so burnt out",2021-05-26 00:53:48,here_fornow,nl8pab
Alzheimers,how much responsibility can an Alzheimer's patient take on?,"My father is in the mid-stage of Alzheimer's. He's only 67 and has always been my mother's greatest protector but the disease has caused him to not recognize her and can become verbally abusive, despite her best care. I struggle wondering whether or not he should be reprimanded in any way (left alone for an hour or two, ect). He no longer has the capacity to feel remorse for his actions and instead always feels like he is being victimized. We have an extremely close family, all of whom are bending over backwards to help. When he lashes out, I don't know whether or not recounting his poor behavior is worthwhile or if we should just comfort him because he is ill. Any thoughts?","It's not him lashing out it's the disease. I wouldn't reprimanded him because he won't know what it's for. He'll just know he's being yelled at/ignored/feeling uncomfortable. 

Instead deflect and draw attention somewhere else or to something else. TV, food, toys, magazines or whatever. 

Sometimes when my dad gets combative about us standing him up, getting his clothes changed, or whatever we take a break (just like a minute or two) and try again. Sometimes we just approach him differently and that helps.
absolutely do NOT reprimand him. as you've said, he won't understand it and it will only cause more discomfort for him and everyone else.
Please just comfort him. It’s not him.
Please see if you can join a support group. They were the biggest help with me trying to get through this. The time just sharing Alzheimer’s stories with other caregivers helps give you perspective and coping strategies. Remember to take care of yourself. It’s the disease but the messenger can be a real jerk and really hurt you.
This disease is just awful. 😣
My family and I are currently going through this with my Dad.

I feel we are just learning as we go along but I have found distraction to work best.

If he's adamant he has to do something I don't argue against him. I ask how does he want us to do it or what way he wants it done and then I tell him we'll sort out whatever the problem is, sometimes I tell him I can sort it out over the phone and he's happy with that sometimes.

Food can be a good distraction offering him cups of tea or a treat can sometimes distract and settle him too. Even if he says no, if I put the tea or treat  down beside him he'll drink/eat at it. I don't know if it's the healthiest option but at this stage it's about keeping them settled 

I think if you argue with them they just get more agitated and think you are trying to trick them or do something more on them.

We are currently in a hospital with him as he seems to be in a delirium so at times he wants to go or leave. I just ask him to show me where he wants to go and we walk through the corridors and I direct him away from other rooms and eventually guide him back to his room again. Sometimes that helps him get some exercise in and tire him out a little bit.

I generally get a newspaper and ask him if he's seen the news today and read out some of the news to him to keep him occupied.

I find because of the delirium, he forgets what he did yesterday, so to reprimand him or some kind of punishment wouldn't stick. It would just agitate and confuse him, and make him feel we are against him at the time and make him more difficult to deal with.

I've heard it said that it's easier for us to enter and understand their world than it is for them to understand ours.

It's not perfect and your case might be different to ours but they are just some things I've found to help keeping Dad settled.
thanks you for all of your replies. For anyone concerned about how we're treating him, rest assured he is being cared for to the absolute best of our abilities with more patience than we thought we had - as I'm sure you're doing with your concerned. I hope you're all taking care of yourselves too!",2021-05-25 21:58:26,martin_84,nl5oqd

Alzheimers,Need advice,"I live a far distance from my dad, he is 67 and has never really had the best memory.  He and my stepmom usually don’t let me know if things are wrong medically with them until it is absolutely unavoidable but my step mom dropped a bomb on me this weekend.  Apparently my dad has been getting progressively worse, this weekend he attended a baptism and didn’t know the names of the relatives there and insisted he saw his sister who died last year.  On the way home he instructed my stepmom on the way home but was giving her completely wrong directions even though he has lived in this area his entire life.  When he got home he was insisting that someone was trying to steal his house and sobbed.  My stepmom told me these episodes sometimes are worse at night, that he has emotional outbursts (he has never been prone to cry) and has also started pacing and wandering in the house.  She even told me that when they are out she has to take a portable jug for him to pee in occasionally.  This sounds serious to me and they are just now finally starting to get this looked at.  His mom (my grandma) had Alzheimer’s and I am concerned that is what this is.  Am I just over reacting?","Yes this sounds like it could be Alzheimer’s. He needs to see a doctor sooner than later.
Before you get a formal diagnosis, you might want to ask your step mom if they have all their legal docs in order - wills, power of attorney forms for both financial and medical decisions. 

She might find it easier to get all that in order before there's a diagnosis that would make it contestable if he signs something. And you'll want all that to be in order, because someone will need to have access to his medical info and be able to make decisions for him.  I don't know if she's handling their finances at this point, that'd be a good thing to ask.

If he's resistant to any of this, a good way to handle it (and the way my dad handled it with my mother) is to go in together and do things jointly. ""Hey, we should update our wills, and while we are there I want to make sure we each have power of attorney for medical decisions for each other."" Not ""I want you to sign over poa to me because you're getting dementia."" My parents had theirs written so they were each the primary person for each other, and it said that if the other was incapacitated too (like if they were in a car crash together, or my dad had a heart attack and my mom had dementia), then I was an alternate POA. This would be a good way for your step mom to make sure you (or another sibling) can step in if she needs something, since your dad won't be capable of handling her affairs.

And the same tactic could be used for evaluations. Yes, he needs to be seen. But instead of ""you need to see a doctor, you're acting crazy"" it could be ""I think we should both go in for annual screenings now that the pandemic's dying down a bit"" and she books dual appointments, and she slips the doctor or front desk a written note with her concerns about your father.
You are not over reacting. It getting worse at night sounds like sundowners which is very common with dementia. Your step mother needs to get him in to see a neurologist sooner rather than later. Obviously there isn't a cure, but getting a diagnosis means he can get on medication that helps slow the process. Maybe help her with the researching of doctors and helping her get appointments since you can't be there in person. He's going to fight going to the doctor, so she's going to have to be strong about getting him there against his will.
The pacing and emotional outbursts at night sounds like sun-downing. I agree with previous comment that it seems he is in mid levels of some kind of dementia.",2021-05-24 19:32:54,,nkbj1e
Alzheimers,Helping out my cousin find resources,"Hello,

Found out my cousin's wife has advance Alzheimers in her 40s with 2-3 years life expectancy. He is struggling finding support to help take care of her and based on what he told me isn't maximizing his health insurance/benefits 100% because he doesn't know what he is entitled. 

He is under a lot stress and I wanted to help him find resources to get a care taker/nurse and teaches him his rights with California health insurance & disability.  This is just what I got from one hour catching up. I found some resources already for him to contact but wanted to post here to see if fellow redditors may have information/resources specific to Latinos.

Alzheimers,"Mom’s memory is okay, but speech, problem solving and motor skills are bad","She was diagnosed with early onset about a year ago. Haven’t seen the docs much since the pandemic. 

I’m mostly just curious for more information. When I do research on the disease, the focus seems to be more on the memory and less on these other aspects. 

Does this suggest a certain type of Alzheimer’s or dementia? Or is just different for everyone?","I'm not a doctor, but I have dementia experience both personally and professionally of roughly 15 years. I also have helped create dementia classes for new care staff to learn from. 

In my opinion, this sounds more like Lewy Body dementia, although it may be AZ, motor skills don't usually decline that quickly. 

For more info, contact Lewy Body Dementia Association. I don't know how to link but just Google it and the website should pop up right away
Take a look at primary progressive aphasia. There are 3 or 4 variants and one of the first indicators is speech problems that eventually progress to motor skills and memory, then dementia
My dads short term memory is bad. Speech is bad, searching for words, stumbles on words…. Long term memory is still in tact. He has a tremor only on his right side and was diagnosed first with ALZ and then with corticobasal degeneration",2021-05-23 11:21:02,MsAndDems,nj9v3u
Alzheimers,Bra shopping,Any ideas for bra shopping for my wife? Clearly new to this so do stores have fitting service? Is there an online option? Thanks,"I would save yourself some stress and go for comfy sports bras. You can just go off her clothing size. If you want her to have a properly fitted bra you can check her previous sizing. If she has gained/lost weight a visit to /r/abrathatfits will be useful.
Look on the tag of her favorite bra to find the size. All bra makers have online stores. Big department stores have a salesperson that can help you. Google ""bra shops near me"" to find a lingerie store, that may have specialty bras that your wife might like better. Take a bra with you so the salesperson knows the size and style your wife likes. 

For ease of putting the bra on her, I would suggest a front close bra.

Clothes shopping for my wife has been an adventure since women's clothes sizes are all over the place and much different than men's. I got the same size bras and it worked after I adjusted the straps. Never realized bras were adjustable before.
One thing to consider is that as Alzheimer's progresses, gentle pressure is a good thing, so a front close sports bra that might be a little more supportive and snug may be a great option.  But then again, sometimes dementia patients get tactile defensiveness and want nothing touching them... so ... ugh.
I'm a geriatric nurse with a specialty in hospice.  Skip the bras unless she is very large chested and use camisole or soft tank tops instead.  Some good options [here](https://www.buckandbuck.com/womens-clothing/underwear-and-socks/bras-panties.html).  I absolutely love the back-zippered jumpsuits on the same site.
I had the best luck with sports bra and then front close bra with Velcro. Eventually no bra was the best.
my mom took my grandma to a locally owned bra speciality store. Just to get her a couple nicer bras for when we go out to an event or something grandma does look put together. If you are looking for something just to give her some modesty, I would suggest the front close sports bras that are marked light intensity those aren't as restrictive. cami's with built in bras would be good for around home.",2021-05-22 10:30:08,trpchops,nijucu
Alzheimers,Resources in Vietnamese,"My mom has recently taken on taking care of my grandma 24/7. My mom's primary language is Vietnamese, with conversational English. My grandma only knows Vietnamese, maybe some Cantonese if she hasn't lost it yet. I'm not literate in Vietnamese at all. 

I'm looking for resources and support groups in Vietnamese to send to my mom. She doesn't know anyone else in her situation, and I think she would benefit from learning about how to deal with my grandma's hostility and confusion better. I know I can put things through Google Translate, but it would be nice if she could navigate the website on her own in Vietnamese instead of me sending her a bunch of links since she's not the best with tech. I think a support group would go a long way since she's pretty alone in the situation now, and has anxieties about developing dementia herself since my great-grandma was also affected.

At Lorenzo’s Camp there will be time to bond, share our story if we want, listen to the stories of other kids. There will be time to share our own caregiver ideas and learn from each other. There will be time for raffle prizes, to do cool art, laugh and maybe even heal some. Most important, it’s a time to build an alliance with one another because we are on our similar journey and can help each other.

Alzheimers,Wanted to give an update on my gma,"For like 2.5 weeks, I would have to look at my journal for exact dates, but my gma has been getting weak from 4-6 pm. My mother and I have moved her dinner early and I take her for walks(well, rolls, she's in a wheelchair when needed) to get her out the house and get some sunlight. . The past two days, she wants to ""do it herself"". She has a walker and she is ""grown"" lol.  I told my mom to help lift her, but let her think she did it herself. She's gotten some confidence back thinking she's doing it herself, which is good, but now, when she needs help and ask for it, she gets mad. My grandma is a trip. 6+ years now for me. 1.5 for my mom taking care physically. She's still learning. 

I do know my gma is happy that my mom and I are here. The other day, she pretty much ignored her other kids(on the phone, who lived down the street and did nothing, yet my mother and I had to move here to take care of her). I'm going to say allegedly, but allegedly, word on the street was they planned on putting her in a home and leaving her so they could wait for her to pass and get her money(they are disgusting people). Surprise when I got here, from a place I loved living and working in, they left. My mom and I are the only ones that have really taken care of her since she was diagnosed. My brother is the only grandchild that calls. Frustrated, but people suck as we learned over the last year. 

My gma has talked badly about my mother and I since as long as I can remember. As much as that upset me growing up, I'm glad I can be here for her now.","You are a good person and so is your mom.  I wish you the best of luck.  Try to take turns get get out a bit now that the pandemic is nearing the end.  Good luck!

Alzheimers,Is this fidgeting?,"Hello,

I need some advice. My dad has been banging on his bedroom walls late at night. He's also been tapping his dishes with his utensils lately during meals. He doesn't seem agitated when he's doing it and he says he doesn't know why he's doing it either. I think it might be because he's bored, but I'm not sure. Is this fidgeting? I was was thinking of getting a fidget blanket, but I'm not sure if it will help. Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

&#x200B;

Thank you","My dad is super fidgety. He puts his hands around his neck and taps his elbows together a lot, it's so funny looking. But we have given him a bunch of stuff to keep his hands busy.

Fidget toys and blankets are great. We got my dad this [fidget cube](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fisher-Price-My-First-Fidget-Cube/331983252?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=101051545&&adid=22222222228000000000&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=m&wl3=42423897272&wl4=pla-51320962143&wl5=9011164&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=334061771&wl11=online&wl12=331983252&veh=sem&gclid=Cj0KCQjwkZiFBhD9ARIsAGxFX8Cteq1Iy2qndpt1FBKq8feo6ezd4ei-KZ7z0YInbWd97IP8B22scNQaAj8ZEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) that's meant for kids but he loves it. We have a mirror which he really gets a kick out of looking at himself, blocks, cars and board books. He's putting pretty much anything in his mouth so we stick with toddler toys. Right now it's the fidget cube and mirror on a stand that are big hits.
Yeah def sounds like it could be.
If he likes animals, one of the robotic pet toys might be comforting for him. For my mother, it gives her hands something to do (petting) and is like an emotional support pet too, and it's something she can sleep with. 

I didn't know if she'd think we were treating her like she was stupid or childish by getting it for her, if she was far enough along to think it was a real cat or not, or if it was babyish to have a stuffed animal. So I cautiously worded it like we got this because we know you like cats and thought this might remind you of the cats we had when I was growing up. And I let her take it from there. She immediately thought it was real, and it didn't phase her at all that she was unpacking a real cat from an amazon box. :)

Alzheimers,"I keep having nightmares that I've dismantled my mom's home and she miraculously recovered, and it's all a mistake, and I've ruined her life.",,"Caregivers are victims of this disease too. If you have the means, therapy is a great outlet to get feelings off of your chest. You're going to have a lot of guilt, fear, anger, sadness, depression. Make sure while taking care of her you still take care of yourself.
I do that all the time! It sucks. I had one where my dad (he died several years ago from brain cancer) showed up at my house asking me why the hell we sold the house and moved my mom into memory care, that she was perfectly fine while he was caring for her, so what were we doing wrong. I woke up in a panic second-guessing every decision we've made for her.

And I second what Reichiroo says. I put off my own care needs for five years while being the one making every medical decision of my mom's. I'm catching up now and so far all has been decent enough, but they found I'm severely anemic, so I'm going through a lot of testing to make sure it's just diet and not something else.
I so understand. The way the disease progresses is very hard on caregivers. My mother has been dealing with dementia since 2013. I have questioned so much. Even now in the last stage she will go from being able to walk with minimal help to being bed and wheelchair bound. Some days I have to feed her.  Others she does fine on her own. 

You are doing the best you can do.  It’s not easy now, nor will it get easier because you love your mom. Take it one day at a time. Know that you will grieve and worry over and over, but you will also have periods of time you can recover. Make sure you are getting support from groups like this sub, Alzconnect, Dementia with Grace, and others. They will help you see what’s going on and help you plan for what’s ahead. You will feel much less panicked and alone.
That wouldn’t ruin her life. Stopping loving her might. Or chopping off her legs, but even if you did dismantle her entire home, it could be repaired. 

Try not to sweat the small stuff. Love her to the best of your ability for as long as she’s here and beyond, and she’ll love you no less. 🙂
I’m so sorry you’re struggling with this. When my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, it was almost a sense of relief because I’d been going through exactly this. Before diagnosis I moved her into my home and took away her keys. It felt right and yet……… I couldn’t stop doubting myself. I couldn’t stop worrying that I was some sort of drama queen. Was I projecting trouble where there was none? Could I be struggling with some sort of Munchausen’s by proxy and giving my mom problems she didn’t really have?? I don’t have siblings so I felt very alone in making these determinations. 

Then the doctor diagnosed her and it hurt, but I felt like I could breathe. It was real. I did the right thing in taking proactive steps to keep her safe. I still feel guilt, even though it’s the disease that’s making things hard for her, not me. But the guilt is so much less now that a professional has weighed in. 

I hope you’re able to get some support and relief soon.",2021-05-20 06:35:30,PegShop,ngwq1s

Alzheimers,Need some assistance and strategies as a semi-caretaker.,"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is half catharsis for me and half cry-for-help. The most relevant parts of this post are the last couple of paragraphs; a lot of the rest is back-story.

My mother started suffering from Alzheimer's in 2015-2016, when she was 71. My father (they've been married over 50 years) has been her primary caretaker during her decline. I moved back in with them a couple of years ago to help out where I can, but he and I are both struggling and in need of some help and suggestions.

I was the first one to notice my mother's cognitive decline throughout 2015-2016. We had a memory test done that did not show any issues, so everyone relaxed about it for the better part of a year, but when it started getting worse, we started pursuing it again and got the crushing news. My grandfather on my father's side also had Alzheimer's in the '90s, so my father has some experience with this, but it's his first time actually living with it 24/7. By the point where we got our ""diagnosis"", my mom was already starting to show confusion about every-day things like the date. My dad did not want her told that she had Alzheimer's, so she has gone through her decline and care without any knowledge that she is suffering from this. He is also adamant that he does not want her put in a nursing home (though in light of the below recent developments, he has started talking to an in-home caretaker as well as a senior ""day care"" facility).

Over the past year and a half or so, my mom has gone through a very sharp decline, both in her mental capabilities and her treatment of her family. My dad is now having a lot of trouble getting her showered and is starting to have problems helping her in the bathroom as well. She has to go very frequently (sometimes several times in an hour), and can't go on her own (she often forgets to pull down her pants/underwear), but when he tries to help, she accuses him of molesting her and refuses to believe that she is safe with her family, or at home. She has become abusive, inasmuch as can be labeled as ""abuse"" with this disease, and has been verbally harassing/attacking my dad with increasing frequency throughout the day, alternating with showing him love and affection. She also sometimes does not seem to process or understand the things we say to her, and has been asking for ""help"" but then cannot articulate what she needs help with, and accuses us of not wanting to help her. She cannot control her urges to stand up and walk around and wander, and then tells us how badly her knees or back are hurting. We haven't been able to get through to her that she needs to rest and that her frequent walking around is contributing to her pain.

My dad, who is extremely sensitive and has had anxiety issues for a long time, is struggling under this burden and his interactions with her are sometimes not constructive. He often reminds her of something they've seen or done together and follows it up with comments such as, ""Don't you remember?"" or ""We've been through this X times today."" He has a lot of trouble not taking the cruel things she says personally, and his frustration often comes out when she does something ""wrong"" (his tone and mannerisms will be very clearly annoyed or frustrated or stressed out). I think these behaviors are causing my mom to emotionally associate him/his presence with feeling berated or attacked, and are degrading her relationship with him more than it would otherwise. Unfortunately, when I've tried to bring up this concern with him, he gets defensive and tells me I need to be more empathetic of what he's going through, or tells me I don't know what he's enduring because my mom tends to respond better to me and trust me more than she does him. I've tried to convince him to go to a therapist or support group to learn coping mechanisms and strategies, but he has been resistant to this. I believe he is already on antidepressants, along with both of them being on a whole pharmacy's worth of other prescriptions and supplements, but I'm very worried about his mental health.

I'm looking for suggestions on how to make my mom more comfortable and receptive to our help, and any advice that can be given on how to coach my dad to interact more constructively with her. I thank you all greatly in advance for your time reading this and helping out.","100% recommend in-house or day care.  Everyone needs a break.    Everything you describe is just the way it is.  Folks deteriorate differently (anger, confusion, losing the ability to speak and everything else).  You also need to get a Power of Attorney for your mom if she has any accounts in just her name or for the possibility that your dad dies from the stress (it happens).  Get one for him too, you can keep it aside until you need it.  Have you tried re-directing, you can google it.  Basically, change the subject when your mom won’t comply.  Try putting on some music your mom used to like.  Ask friends for help.  Even if it’s just, hey, can you sit at the house for 20 minutes while dad and me pick up carry out.  Call your local area agency on aging, they may have suggestions for day care and help.  Good luck.
My grandfather is and has been going through the same types of Alzheimer’s symptoms you are describing. His doctor has worked with us to find medications that work to help ease his anxieties and help with some of the anger flare ups. These meds don’t and aren’t intended to turn him into a zombie. We have had to adjust dosages and work with a variety of meds as his disease progresses, but the medication has been a huge help for both him, his family, and his caretakers. He is more calm and less restless and not as combative.
Oh I am so sorry you are going through this!  Your parents need a lot more help.  My only advice is to contact your local Office for the Aging (other names if not on US but through health departments).  

We had great people there to refer us to respite care, Medicaid applications/process, legal concerns, nursing facilities, etc.  In addition they post numerous resources on communication and support including local groups.  The following is an amazing site/resource too.

I hate to say it but it may be time to consider a placement that works for them both.   I am so sorry!  Others may have more specific advice as well.  Feel free to DM where you are and I can look up for you!",2021-05-18 11:57:55,tigerxchaos,nfed58
Alzheimers,Anyone have any tips to deal with sudden bouts of violence?,"My father is pretty far progressed in his Alzheimers. Lately, when he hasn't slept (a regular occurrence where he might not sleep for two days straight) he might try to get violent with his caretakers. He's succeeded quite a few times, and today was the first time he's seriously hurt his main caretaker who has been with the family for 8 years now. He punched her hard in the face while she was changing him. She says she cat chew on her left side, but attributes it to swelling. I told her we would cover any medical costs and I like take her to urgent care since I'm afraid he might have damaged her jaw, but she wants to wait it out for now.

Ironically that sudden violent act tuckered him out and he pretty much fell asleep right afterwards.

I've already talked to his doctor about upping his medications before this incident and am waiting for him to call back to see what else we can do, but while I wait for them to call back, I was hoping to get some advice from other people who have experienced the same thing.

My siblings and I are discussing our options right now, though obviously we're waiting to talk to the doctor, but any advice from someone who's experienced this before would greatly help. Obviously, we've never been in this situation before. His caretaker, while adamant that she's okay and she is fine taking care of dad, looked unsure for the first time since I've known her. Frankly, I wouldn't blame her if she finally had to tap out, no matter how much she cares for dad. We have another caretaker, a man, who has been getting the brunt of his violent outbursts, but he barely even bat's an eye when it happens. My brother lives at home and he's usually able to control my dad when he starts to act up, but he can only be there for so much of it. He's stuck in his job until November, but he's considering taking family leave at that point so he can be home to help handle dad.

That's where we're at now. Any advice is appreciated!","When I was caring for my grandmother one thing that sometimes worked is I’d stop and leave the room and come back and tell her I was someone else. 

Sometimes I’d tell her her granddaughter was here to visit and we needed to get her ready. Which, since I am her granddaughter was technically true. 

Sometimes we would just have to circle back and try again in 30 minutes. 

You can bring it up with his physician and try to medicate. My grandmother needed help sleeping as things progressed. She was also on some mood stabilizers.
This was a regular occurrence at my Dad's nursing home. The staff usually walked away (to the door way so they could still see them, be out of reach, but close enough to run in if needed) and waited them out.  There is no reasoning at this phase usually.
Definitely talk to doctor!  And start now to plan for alternative care and possible placement.  

Often things progress where one person can no longer handle things and a team of care is needed.  Sounds like that may be the case — and I agree, you may lose this caregiver.  

https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/daily-care/communications
That's where we are with mom. She allegedly fractured a nurse's wrist at the community where she was living. The only thing that seems to work are Haldol injections. None of the other mood stabilizers were working.
Bless your heart. This was one of the toughest things we went through as a family. Hugs to everyone. 

The docs will medicate him up - which I hope works for you. It didn't work for my LO - who we then committed to a geriatric psychiatry ward for awhile, which didn't help at all. In hindsight, I believe her medications were making her uncomfortable somehow, triggering a fight response. They gave hr more, and she got more agitated. We ""locked her up"" and it agitated her even more. Awful time in our lives. Hold onto hope tho - We're all much better now. 

So my advice - It seems like the issue is him not sleeping, which is making him grumpy. Is there anything you can do it make sleeping more comfortable and relaxing for him? Noise machine, type of sheets/bedding, or nightlight. Perhaps start some bedtime rituals like a singing a particular song/prayer or having a cup of really strong valerian root tea along with his meds. My LO has a small icecream sandwich before her first bedtime (she sleeps a few hours, gets up for awhile, then goes back to bed.) Perhaps there's a a pea under his mattress that needs to be cleaned up (seriously something silly like that might be the issue). 

Check his medications for side-effects such as insomnia, restless legs, etc. Ask doc for switching out to meds, rather than adding to the meds. LO is still on mirtazapine to help her relax, but it makes her hungry so she'll wake up in the middle of the night for a snack. 

Best of luck to you all.
A small dose of THC is what I use for my mother. She is also on a anti seizure drug. I find the meds cause more problems than they help. She is violent a lot. THC works. Her neurologist was happy when I found something that worked and now prescribed it. We discovered it worked when my son popped a gummy in her mouth when she was a raging maniac. 30 minutes later she was smiling and dancing.",2021-05-18 15:21:26,EloquentGrl,nfjlt9
Alzheimers,Gamma light and sound therapy for Alzheimer's,"First time posting here.  My wife has early Alzheimer's or mild cognitive dysfunction.  We recently heard about gamma light and sound therapy to remove amyloid and prevent tau, with light (and sound) flickering at 40 per second.  Not sure if this is the right forum to discuss this since she is very early and lots of posts here seem to be about more severe/later cases.  There is a free app that works on phones with a refresh of 120/sce such as iPhones or iPads.  It's called AlzLive, can download from app store, free or $9.00 a month for enhanced version.  There are also lamps that do it apparently.  Does anyone have experience with this?","Never heard of it.  Have you researched the (reputable) scientific literature on it?  I ask because it kind of seems like crystals or something.  Is it all placebo effect?
I had not heard of this but it seems interesting. There is an ongoing [study using gamma light](https://www.alzheimers.gov/clinical-trials/light-and-cognitive-therapy-alzheimers-disease) that I saw when I did a quick Google search. I would check with her doc but I really don't see how it would hurt unless she is prone to seizures.
Will check out this app right now!  I agree, would love to hear from more people dealing with the early phases and MCI.  Thank you!
This is still in research phases where most results are from mice but humans trials are still ongoing. If she doesn’t seem harmed by it give it a shot
There is a study for early Alzheimer's patients that uses deep brain stimulation therapy similar to what is used for Parkinson's and essential tremor.  You can even participate if you are already on an Alzheimer's medication. Not sure if you are near to any of their enrolling clinics though.
i heard that on NPR, I can’t remember the program, but I remember wondering the same thing.  I thought it was 80 beats per second, but I only heard a part of the program.  Also, they had trouble finding light bulbs that would flash that quickly.  Whatever the frequency, there are things to consider with technological limitations: the mice were in a room lit by 80 beats/second lamps all around for an hour.  I would seriously question any you can find on amazon, for example, because they’re probably knock offs, and i don’t know what instrumentation we need to accurately measure this.  also, older screens at least, had refresh rates that you could change so you wouldn’t get a headache, and i think the default rate was 60.  i don’t know screen tech nowadays, but there may be something that prevents a phone screen from being able to blink on and off 80 times a second.  also, consider that movies are usually filmed at different frames per second, because our eyes only really need about 24 (? some low number) frames per second to create a credible moving picture in our brain.  i really want to look into this too!  i just don’t know how to begin to check that the light is a actually beating at 40/80 beats per second.  maybe i’ll look that up this week.  i wish i could remember the program.  RadioLab maybe?  I’ll update if I find out something.  It sounded so promising!
The closest I am to knowing about it is once I got a gift certificate to a float tank experience. When I went they pushed some kind of light wave therapy experience on me as a freebie to get me hooked on it, which I was not into at all but the sales guy was persistent and I gave in to shut him up. This was like 30 years ago. 

Anyway, they put a pair of dorky star trek looking glasses on me and sat me in a big chair that looked like a massage chair. Then through the glasses they just showed a bunch of slides, like an old viewmaster thing, it was all slides of old famous paintings. It was the dumbest thing ever. I didn't see the point of it or what I was supposed to get from it. But I tend to be skeptical of touchy feely Gwyneth Paltrow goop kinda stuff.  I did think it was at least a nice coincidence though that they showed me art history stuff and I was an art major in college. 

When the slides were done the guy came back and asked me what I thought of it, I shrugged and gave him my whatever face. He asked if I saw anything during it, I said no, just the paintings, not like any hallucinations. Him: the paintings???  So it turns out there were no slides, no paintings, just little flashes of light at a particular speed and my brain made up an art history show for me like I was on drugs, but there was no drugs.
Tried various light / sound stimulation with my elderly mother with alzheimer's to no effect.  It didn't hurt, though didn't do anything also.
My father just did this as part of a clinical trial for about a year. It required him to watch the lights/sounds for an hour every day and record feedback. Hard to say if it helped slow progression. I’m sorry about your wife’s diagnosis.",2021-05-17 14:46:49,jrsaxplayer,neoc9w
Alzheimers,Happy For this group,"I'm glad we have a place we can ask questions. I want to thank y'all for being here for me and my family. I've been doing this for 6 years now, so if anyone wants info from me, feel free to ask.","My wife has Lewy-bodies. Due to her age and coping skills it took 3 years to finally get her diagnosed at the end of 2019. Her doctors refused to believe she had Alzheimers up to this point.

My game plan was to get the house ready for the market (it needs a lot of work) and take care of her at home as long as I can.

I thought I had numerous years and when two of our grown kids moved home due to the pandemic, I put planning for her future on hold. Now they are getting ready to move back to their jobs out of state. I have another child who lives 45 minutes away, who he is busy working hard and playing hard.

But, she is deteriorating fast. The latest - Losing the ability to feed herself and now she wanders the house to find the bathroom. She can still wipe but refuses (doesn't understand) to put the used toilet paper in the toilet.

She is receiving SSDI (now our only income) and is on Medicare. I haven't had a conversation with social security about her long term options. I have recently reached out to our state, Maryland and they have an annual 160 hour respite care program that I am applying for. I also have all the power of attorneys in place.

My question is, how should I plan for her transition to a nursing home?

As long as she knows where she is and recognizes me, I hope to be her primary care giver here at home. Is this realistic?

When I have to put her in a nursing home, will social security provide any help? We live in a high cost of living area. Would I be able to put her in a nicer home and pay the difference? Could I move her to a home in a more affordable neighboring state? Would it be more cost effective to bring medical help into our house?

We have some wealth and I will take care of my wife, but I (60M) am very worried about my financial future.",2021-05-17 03:25:33,KcirdnekC,ne9kpb
Alzheimers,Does Antidepressants Increase the Chances of Developing Alzheimer's Disease?,I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder at age 16 and has been taking benzos on and off. During my college life I took adderall/concerta for my adhd symptoms. Recently I have noticed I have developed ataxia which I have trouble walking in a straight line or even balancing. I googled prolonged use of benzos can develop ataxia and alzheimer's disease. Now I am very scared and was wondering if ataxia can not be reversed or not. Please shed some light thx.,"I am not familiar with its link to ataxia but a handful of studies in the past few years have suggested antidepressants may actually help prevent dementia; most of these studies cite the link of depression with dementia. However, last year in 2020, I saw both a study stating as much but a different one stating that some antidepressants may contribute to dementia. Even this year there is new information suggesting that antidepressants may damage the brain in which it could, along with other factors, cause dementia.

Honestly, when you dig into these studies they don’t always have control groups or state which antidepressants were used. Plus there is a long list of other factors that may or most likely contribute to dementia later in life, so it’s difficult to pinpoint antidepressants’ role in the disease. Another thing worth noting, some of these studies only focused on older adults taking antidepressants, not younger people or those who have taken it for years. I would imagine prolonged use could have negative effects, like most medications that affect the brain, but that’s just based on the little data available. 

I would suggest speaking with both your primary and a neurologist rather than Googling or asking here. You may find well-intended people trying to help but more than likely you’ll find contradictory studies or misinformed people. Medical journals might be a good resource but only if you’re familiar with reading them and being able to access them. But doctors and specialists will provide you with the best information, especially new information, and will help you make more informed decisions.
Neither benzodiazepines nor Adderal are antidepressants. Most people are referring to SSRIs when they mention antidepressants (like Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, etc.). I believe I ran across some studies linking bezos to possible increased risk, which would make sense to me since they have similar effects to alcohol on the Gaba system.

However, the stronger associations I've come across is depression itself, so I would suspect improving depression and other mental health issues should be the number one priority over reducing medications. Also avoiding recreational drugs, especially uppers and downers (alcohol included) seems prudent.
1. Ataxia is a symptom, not a diagnosis.  Causes range from drunkenness/intox to just being clumsy to devastating cerebellar problems.  If you are concerned, go see a neurologist. 
2. Alzheimer's disease is NOT caused by antidepressants.  In fact, there's some animal model data that shows them to be protective.  Alzheimer's has a long undetected period before diagnosis, and causes depression/anxiety.  So AD increases the chances of being prescribed meds, not vice versa.

Alzheimers,Wandering and caretaker aggression,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to put this. This is a genuine question I don’t mean to cause harm if I do. 

My late grandpa (mom’s dad) lived with me and my family when I was really little, so the memories I have are very limited. I do remember him running out the house and my dad chasing after him. My dad would pick him up and practically drag him back into the house. My grandpa would be screaming and yelling like he was about to get murdered. 

My grandfather was also pretty aggressive. He would knock stuff over and yell at everyone. 
I was reminded of this memory a little while ago and I’ve been thinking about it ever since. When my dad tells his account of what happens, he makes himself to be the hero. ‘The son in law who cared about his wife’s dad so much that he even embarrassed himself just to make sure he was safe.’ My dad is a narcissist so I know that’s not true. 

Is it possible that my grandfather acted this way because of my dads aggression towards him? Is it even right to drag someone into the house against there will even with Alzheimer’s/dementia? Maybe my grandfather felt trapped and was trying to escape.","is it *possible?* i mean, yeah. anything is possible. but thats sort of a leading question to get the answer it seems you really want to hear, which is that your dad is awful and handled the situation incorrectly. 

the truth is, you will never know the actual truth of the matter. it was in the past and every person involved will have a bias memory of it, especially since it was an emotionally charged and difficult time for everyone involved, including yourself even though you were just a child. 

here are some facts: this is not an uncommon behavior for someone with alzheimers or dementia. running, leaving, wandering, and eventually “escaping” once preventative measures are taken to prevent the wandering is common. even with someone who is happy and treated well. 

if you scroll back far enough on this sub you will find multiple stories of people’s grandmas or dads or whoever reaching a point where they no longer recognize the house they lived in their whole lives. they’ll get agitated and ask when they can go home, and no amount of explaining “you are home!” will change their minds. they don’t recognize their surroundings, they get scared and angry, and they try to leave. its even worse for people who actually have been moved to a new home to receive care. 

when someone with alzheimers or dementia is known to be aggressive, and they are trying to run away, there arent many options. you can either call the police, deal with it yourself, or...if the family can afford the massive cost....put them in a 24/7 care facility. 

if you go with the call the “cops” or “deal with it yourself” options when faced with an aggressive, demented elder trying to run away, theres really only two directions it can go. 1) you can reason with them, calmly trying to distract and deescalate them until you can convince them to come back inside. this takes a ton of patience and skill, and also depends greatly on the stage of alzheimers the person is in. 2) manhandle them back inside. this only takes someone who’s bigger or stronger than the elderly person trying to leave. 

now, option 1 is clearly the better one. its less harmful overall. but, depending on the person who’s trying to “escape”, and their mental state, it may not always be possible. i have no idea, and nor do you, if your grandpa fit the bill for being manhandled vs calmed down. 

overall, this behavior is not uncommon and your dads handling of it was not recommended but also not uncommon. 

to answer your questions more directly: its possible your grandpa wanted to get away from your dad, and your dads handling of him made the whole situation worse. it is equally possible he would have acted this way even if your dad wasnt around, since there are many very well-treated people with alzheimers who still try to escape their own homes for no apparent reason, other than thinking they arent actually home and are being held captive in some way. 

and: is it right to treat them this way? well...whats the other option if they are being aggressive? let them wander away and get hit by a car or get lost in the woods? like i said, you can call the cops, pay for a care facility, or deal with it yourself. and depending on the person, physically moving them back inside might be the only option if you DONT want them just wandering off and never coming back. 

im sorry you lost your grandfather and these were your last memories of him. it sounds like you have plenty of reasons to dislike your father, but please know that this disease is incredibly difficult to deal with and when family members are left to care for people with alzheimers they are often untrained and just do what they think is necessary.
In your dad's defense, even those who are trained to care for Alzheimer's patients often botch this. Since I've seen so many people who are certified in Alzheimer's care drop the ball, I am not shocked your dad didn't know better. Your grandfather doesn't necessarily feel trapped. He simply isn't comfortable and wanting to ""go home"" is how most express themselves in terms of not being comfortable with the disease. My mom always wants to go home, even when she was in the home she'd lived in for 50 years.

My mom is always trying to escape. If you tell her ""no"" or try to hold her arm to stop her, she'd start punching, pushing, slapping, and kicking to get away. Her first memory care community had three staff members who knew the best option was to just ask if they could go for a walk with her. This is out of 20 Alzheimer's certified carers. Oddly, it was the community's chef that could get her to calm down by walking in the gardens for a while and then go back inside for a cup of coffee and a cookie. Most would grab her arm and tell her no, which does make her scream and start fighting.

Eventually, she was running out of money and had to be moved to a community that accepts Medicaid. Around here, the general rule is you have to live private pay in a Medicaid community for two years or they won't have you. That place became our biggest nightmare. Despite being trained in Alzheimer's care, the staff would frequently grab my mom's arm, yell no at her when she was trying to get outside, and that would lead to her reacting. They called EMTs the first time and she was strapped to a stretcher, taken to the hospital, and given a drug to sedate her. I drove to the ER, calmed her down, had her in a great mood, and brought her back and explained that you can't grab her or tell her no and just to walk with her and all is fine.

A day later, I got another call from another hospital's ER that the community's director had left her in the ER check-in area. The Alzheimer's community didn't even call me. She didn't have a change of clothes or her medications or her COVID vaccination card.  I had to call the community to ask what the hell was going on. It was the same story, one of their trained staff members grabbed her arm and yelled no at her. I was furious. As they dropped her off without pre-approval from her doctor, Medicare won't pay the bills so $2,100 a day and she's now bankrupt. She had to live in the psychiatric ward for a month until placement was found. No one in this state will take in aggressive Alzheimer's patients, so she's out of state now and getting far better care in a community with skilled nurses.
I don't think you're ever going to get ""true"" answers to this puzzle.  The family dynamics of caretaking are very complicated.  You should just le this memory go by the wayside.

Of course it is true that caregivers sometimes are abusive towards their person with dementia. But you can't always tell if that's what is going on.  Let it go.
Wandering is an issue. Hairdresser told me their mom wandered off 2 times from home & it took police both times to find her. Police said if it happens again, mom will need to be put in a home.",2021-05-16 12:31:58,miss_seventy_two,nds1v3
Alzheimers,Finger Foods,"Quick background. My gma is pretty much almost blind, but is still eating well, thank goodness. Looking for a variety of foods for her. If they are in her hand, she'll eat them. If they are not, she forgets and then doesn't eat. Oh and you can't be in the room while she eats. I give her a piece, walk out, and come back in every 2-5 minutes to give hand her more. She does not want to be fed. Any thoughts? We are doing, my chicken dishes, but on a bun, she likes it, but I want to give her some variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

TIA","With my mom, we did cheese sticks, nuts, dates and other dried fruits, apple wedges, grapes, blueberries, cheese and crackers. Basically, if you can imagine it in a 5 year old's lunchables, we did it.

I wonder what the deal is with her not eating with you in the room though. Is she embarrassed she eats messy? Does she think it's rude to eat if you aren't eating, but would feel better if it was like a charcuterie board and you were both eating together? Or is there a chance she's hiding the food while you're out of the room?
Egg muffins.  Egg, cheese, and basically anything else she likes baked in a muffin tin. They are great for breakfast.  Store well in fridge, and can be heated in the microwave in seconds.
Chicken fingers and nuggets. Wrapped sandwiches, burritos, breakfast burritos, quesadillas, cut up fruit, French fries, breakfast biscuits. Jimmy Dean has several different breakfast sandwiches and they have a frozen ham and cheese croissant you heat for 60 seconds. 

Lunchbox designed individual grab bags of chips, cookies, snacks, lunchables, and Lemon, peanut butter, or cheese crackers. Pringles are pretty easy to eat out of the can. Snack packs of veggies or the protein types with cheese, nuts and deli meats or sweet treats are really simple and filling for a afternoon snack. These are by the deli meats and pickles in the grocery store. 

For ice cream or cold snacks, get bars, individually packaged cones, or sandwiches. There’s also frozen yogurt, fruit bars. Kroger has a nice variety of appetizers in their frozen section from their private label. They are all small portions and bite size servings.

Both my mom's late parents had Alzheimer's disease at the end of their lives.  I'm not an expert or an activist about it, but this advert really rubs me the wrong way.

I keep getting this advertisement on Spotify (""watch this and we won't bug you for half an hour, yada"") and from the first time I saw it, it left a really bad taste in my mouth.  It starts off fine but then it seems to suggest the main reason people should be working to treat Alzheimer's is that it's costing everyone a bunch of money, and then goes on to hint at how embarrassed ""we"" (United States picture in the background) should be about being affected by it (financially).

Nothing about the lethality and pain it causes to those affected and their families, just donate to find a cure so the USA can shed the embarrassment of spending money on it.

Alzheimers,How to deal with behaviors in the moment?,,,2021-05-13 22:33:27,jamoe,nbybaq
Alzheimers,Diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment - are these early stages of dementia?,"My mom's partner got very, very stressed during lockdown and was dealing with a lot of anxiety and anger through most of 2020 - he'd been furloughed and was home 24/7, and didn't have opportunities to socialize or partake in any activities. He started experiencing memory issues last fall, was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and put on Donepezil. 

He's been taking it for about six months now, but his condition still seems to be deteriorating. He constantly forgets basic things (like his wallet, phone, sometimes his paychecks), and tends to repeat stories constantly while misremembering details. He's also started having tantrums and showing uncharacteristic impulsivity - he'll do things like yell at my mom in front of the neighbors for not fixing him dinner, or randomly start crying and begging her not to leave him. His mood is very up and down, and he seems depressed and withdrawn overall. He also appears to have trouble sleeping, and is constantly awake when he should be sleeping. 

We've tried to get him to look after his health more, but he can never stick to it for more than a couple days. He rarely gets exercise, doesn't really socialize, won't engage in any mentally stimulating activity (the main things he does at home is watch TV or polish his car), and won't change his diet (he eats a lot of carbs and saturated fats). I'm worried that he'll develop Alzheimer's within the next year at this rate, especially because he doesn't manage his physical and mental health. It's clear he's declining, and it's hasn't even been a year since he started having memory issues. 

Is this how the early stages of Alzheimer's look? Or could it just be MCI combined with stress and poor lifestyle habits?","Mci is just a name chosen before the particular form of dementia has been determined.  But it is step 1 of the  form of dementia that is eventually determined.
Look into Lion’s Mane
There are not officially sanctioned/recommended treatments for MCI (mild cognitive impairment) other than neuro-feedback, cognitive therapies, health/diet and fitness for body and mind.  Believe me I know! 

Some doctor’s do prescribe medications for dementia but most will not unless they have either diagnosed it (normally occurring at a later stage) or they believe that — despite no true medical evidence — these meds may help given a large number of those with MCI do go on to develop dementia. 

I would ask his doctor if he was diagnosed (sometimes they will tell family and sometimes not, often they do not based on HIPAA).  Honestly, he may already have been diagnosed with one form — there are six or seven.  With vascular, frontal-temporal lobe, Alzheimer’s and  other forms there can be definitive behavioral changes too.  

The difference between MCI and dementia’s are not very defined for diagnosis.  Over time monitoring is key.  Many doctors do ask family members to provide input via evidence-based questionnaires when evaluating a patient.  I would ask his doctor.  I included a link below to more informative for you.  I hope you are doing okay and are finding the other support and resources you and your mom need!

Alzheimers,My grandmother has started having long conversations with to her deceased mother in the different mirrors of the house.,"I caught her several times having 5-10 minute conversations with her reflection in the mirror, sometimes even standing in the pitch black bathroom talking to the mirror about the sink. I have asked her who she is speaking to and she says ‘my mom’. 

She has even begun speaking in third person about herself....  it’s very creepy","Sounds like she might be hallucinating. Worth bringing up to her doc so they can properly track her staging into dementia and maybe tweak her meds to help with this. Sorry to hear this is making you uncomfortable. You got this though
My dad this, except he thought he was ""talking"" to the guy in the unit next to his.

He really enjoyed the company and it seemed harmless, but eventually we covered the mirror. He was in a memory ward at that point and they worked hard to get residents out of their rooms and participating in social activities. It got to the point where he was too caught up to eat meals or even visit with us when we were there.

He didn't even seem to notice once we covered it up. It was like the mirror had never been there.

Not saying this is what you should do, but it made a difference in his decline when we stopped it. That said, these weren't 5-10 minute conversations, but over an hour.

Hugs. It's never easy to watch things like this happen.
I heard my mom talking to her deceased sister, it broke my heart
She could have a urinary track infection, that causes dementia like symptoms in old people.
If this is new and sudden, and especially if there are any new and sudden behavior changes, it’s always good to check for a UTI. That’s the only time my mom ever hallucinated (talking to the “person” in the nighttime reflection of the sliding glass door)—the few times it happened it was a UTI.

I know some patients do have hallucinations just regularly, but if it’s a change that happened suddenly (if you know—depends on if you or someone else sees her regularly or lives with her), it’s worth checking out just in case.

This might not be a hallucination, but misidentification due to visual processing declines, and memory issues. 


With declining memory, she could be your recognizing her own  reflection as her elderly mother, not herself. Seeing her mom, having forgot that her mom is dead, she is talking to her. 

Declines in the part of her brain that processes visual images may have an impact on how she processes looking at her reflection and seeing her mom. Your grandmother could simply not recognize herself as elderly at this point, but still has an image of her mom as older.
One of the women in my mom's memory care community used to talk to an FBI agent who was living in her purse. She was fully convinced there was an FBI agent in there giving her missions to complete. She was fine with it, and as I got used to it, the conversations she had with him were kind of hilarious. It's all part of the disease.
My mom did this for a while, also in the dark (though not pitch black darkness because the door would be open) and also in the bathroom mirror sink. Sometimes she sounded like she was gossiping with a friend, but sometimes she’d get riled up telling this same story about her aunt that never actually happened (I asked multiple relatives) and end up agitated.",2021-05-14 15:01:32,kaanapalikid,ncg7mq
Alzheimers,Steamed at a Alzheimer’s joke made by a local business.,"First time poster, but just curious if anyone has dealt with an issue like this.  

Was looking up a local company to get my chimney cleaned and noticed they have random, casual Alzheimer’s “joke” on their business website. Basically the gist is “If you can’t remember the last time you had your chimney cleaned, you’re either overdue or you have Alzheimer’s. Haha!”

As someone who has had their family deeply impacted by this, I was shocked and kind of gut punched. How has no one noticed this? Why is that attempt at humor still up there? Disheartening.

Who knew I’d get so steamed this morning looking at chimney cleaning services?

I called them out with a Google review, but basically I really just wanted to vent to this wonderful group and see if anyone ever had similar experiences. Thanks.

The page with the “joke” on it:
https://www.chimneymonkey.com/service/chimney-sweep/ 

My Google review is their most recent. Hopefully they respond soon to say they have removed it.

UPDATE - I called them out on a few channels, and they have since changed the language to remove the joke. I’ll take it!","""Can’t remember the last time your chimney was cleaned? Then you are probably well overdue for your annual cleaning.""

Looks like you got them to change it.  Well done!
 Congratulations!
Glad you called them out!!",2021-05-13 13:42:45,Roscoe10182241,nbmi4u
Alzheimers,Differentiating between stages?,"I know that Alzheimer’s has 7 stages. I’ve googled a lot about the different stages and I think my grandmother is between 4 and 6.

She sleeps mostly during the day, and is awake wandering around the house throughout the night. She thinks it’s morning when it’s night. She’s extremely paranoid that we’re all going to leave her. Every time she wakes up, she asks several times if she has to go to her job but she’s been retired since the 1990s. She makes up a lot of wild, elaborate stories that aren’t true. Just recently, she started sundowning and tonight it was the worst. She couldn’t understand why it was so dark, but it was 11 at night. She absolutely could not be convinced it was night time. It’s also becoming increasingly difficult to have a conversation with her because it’s like she just doesn’t understand our words. 

She’s well beyond just the memory portion of Alzheimer’s. She can still move around fairly well, but she can’t bathe herself, cook, or drive. Do you think this is still the early-mid stages, or could she be near the end stages? It’s a tough thing to watch and part of me just wants it all to end because I know she’s frustrated and suffering.","The problem I find with the stages is that my mom bounces all over the place. She barely talks anymore. When she does, it's usually two words then a long BURRRRRRRRRR noise. She still showers on her own, she feeds herself, though she's starting not to want to eat. She doesn't drive, but she has no problems walking or running. She can move faster than her aides and nurses if she wants to get away.

She sleeps 2 hours a night if you're lucky. It's all she seems to need. Even her meds designed to help her sleep more just don't do it. She's so paranoid and delusional. If you tell her ""no"" to anything or try to stop her from leaving to go outside, she will turn into a totally different person and fists start flying. She forgets most everything, except things you wish she would forget. She can't remember where she is, what year it is, or the time of day, but you can bet that she'll remember something you said that you never expected she'd remember. One time, I promised to take her for a pint of beer and lunch if we could just get in and out of her dentist's appointment. When we got back into the car after the appointment, she didn't even remember having her teeth cleaned, yet she hadn't forgotten that I promised to take her out to get lunch and a beer.
It definitely sounds like it's more in the advanced stages.  I wouldn't say ""end stage"", but more severe than a 4. It's hard to say without knowing the type of dementia she has and without having the whole picture.
Our neurologist completely disregards stages, and never discusses what stage my LO is in. He said it wasn't that useful for caregiving or actual ""treatment."" Every person experiences Alzheimer's differently, including your grandmother. I found the stages helpful to know what to expect. Perhaps that what you're thinking on now. hugs.

The stages are very important to insurance companies and hospice. So if you really think she's near the end call up hospice and have them do an assessment. Our hospice has ""palliative-care"" which is basically home visits and check-ups for comfort, but not active dying. It might be worth looking into.
Agree with all comments here so far, and my mom bounces around as well, though swiftly approaching the pretty definitive and physically inevitable final stage.  I am so sorry for us all living with loved ones and this cursed disease.",2021-05-14 02:35:56,killing_carlo,nc24co
Alzheimers,Funny story posted in comment re: taking away the car...,"Sharing a funny story about a friend of mine and his dad.  His mom and dad declined at roughly the same time.  His dad kept asking where the car was after the dad had gotten in the last of numerous accidents and the car was retired from service.

My friend’s dad used to call him every day to ask where he put the car!  This went on and on for many months, and my friend had some amazing coping skills to deal with the calls.  

For fun, he made up more outrageous explanations over time for what had happened to the car and where it was... not to be mean but truly to look at the humor of those calls he knew he had to deal with everyday.

The stories went from the norm to the fantastical, the following are examples.

•	⁠Drug cartels in Florida took the car as part of a ring to steal only boring and unremarkable cars for drug mules.

•	⁠Cuba sent a Castro-armed force to take the car because his wife (Cuban) had spoken badly about Cuba. 

•	⁠A neighborhood kid moved the car down the block so the others previously mentioned could not find — so only for safe keeping.

You get the point.  At the end of my friend’s story told each morning, he would explain to his father that the CIA and FBI had already located the car and would return it the next day.  And so, like the movie “Groundhog Day,” rinse and repeat with another creative explanation. 😅","Creativity can save one’s sanity. Good for him.
That is so funny!!
Awesome! Love it!! FIL loved to drive!! He drove longer than he should have. Thankfully nothing bad came of his insistence on driving! Love the story!",2021-05-13 10:50:01,Visible_Implement_80,nbie2x
Alzheimers,Venting about my Dad,"First time posting, sorry if it’s too long!! I just need to vent to people who understand, and who maybe can offer some advice or relate in some way. 
My dad is 74 and was diagnosed almost 3 years ago. I am 23 and it was right around the time that I first moved out, which makes me feel partly to blame for his mental decline. He raised me as a single parent since I was 5, my mom is an alcoholic who has been in and (mostly) out of my life. My dad and I had a good relationship, but he was more of a friend than a parent and had really bad anger issues, so there was lots of yelling and I felt as though I never had a real parent figure. He chose to have me with an alcoholic woman at 50 after spending his life partying and ending up with no savings for when I arrived. It’s safe to say I resent him for this, though I try not to because he did try his best.
Flash forward to now, I’ve been living with him since April 1, 2020. He has gotten so much worse this past year. He can’t make his own meals (doesn’t remember/know how to microwave the food I leave him), doesn’t bathe himself (I have him put a bathing suit on and give him a shower), he doesn’t flush the toilet and/or leaves shit on the seat, takes food out of the fridge and leaves it on the counter, is confused all the time and gets mad at me when I tell him the truth, ie. we sold his car a couple years ago, or our cat passed away (insists I’m wrong or that it’s my fault). He also just talks basically gibberish to me now, usually about what he’s seen on TV, and I feel so guilty because I know he’s lonely but I just can’t Stand to talk to him, it is so frustrating for me to see my only parent like this. He confuses me with his ex wife’s daughter, his sister, or my mom. Every time I’m in the kitchen he asks at least ten times what I’m doing or making “for him” and then when I give him food he has two bites and that’s it. I have to hide my food in the fridge because he will just leave it to rot on the counter. I feel like I’ve had a toddler for the last year and I don’t know how I’ve dealt with it for so long, but now that he is getting really bad I just feel so angry all the time and I have to go to my room and scream into a pillow to keep from yelling at him. This past year has made me so cynical and cold, I love my dad so much, and I feel awful for thinking this, but his death will be a huge relief for me. I feel like I’m going insane. Sorry again for the long post but none of my friends really understand what it’s like dealing with this. Anyways, thanks for letting me vent and any advice is greatly appreciated :)","I’m sorry - that’s really difficult. Are you his care taker? Where do you live? In the United States there are resources available but it can be more difficult than it should be to find them. I’d recommend reaching out to Aging and Disability centers near you - they can almost always point you in the right direction. 

It really is hard and does suck - I hate to say it doesn’t really get better unless other people can help. I’m sorry you’re going through this but I hope this subreddit can be a little place to vent to.
Same here with my birth being ill-advised, the yelling, parent figure/parenting stuff, resentment, rotten food, feeling like you have a toddler you never signed up for, being angry you have to deal with this, and thinking death would be merciful. I don't have any advice because I'm just as upset and lost as you are right now.  

Well, except the guilt about thinking death would be merciful, because I do believe it's true. People let their old, sick pets go to sleep peacefully to spare them from more suffering, but we can't do the same with humans. Parts of my dad have already died. The dad as I knew him is already gone. We just have to watch the rest die in slow motion.
It’s difficult. You’re doing great! Helps to get out. Helps to have activities planned through the day & week. Gives structure. 1 mile dog walks, hikes, chair yoga or lifting weights, visits to senior centers, museums, beach or other events. Breaks up the day/ week.",2021-05-12 22:56:12,nxtxkx,nb6sdq
Alzheimers,"Is it possible that a grocery list could confuse a person with Alzheimer's enough they buy a bunch of the same thing instead of one or two of a handful of similar things like a half dozen of the same cleaning agent rather than kitchen, bathroom and floor cleaners?",,"Not sure about that since we didn't really use lists, but my dad started buying the same things every week even when he still had plenty left because he was used to buying it.
Anything can happen with Alzheimer’s unfortunately.
My mom did this early on when she was still driving and shopping on her own. We ended up with like three things of toothpaste because she couldn’t remember she bought it the previous two times. Nothing you can do, but we were stocked for a while! lol
Anything is possible with Alzheimer’s.  Their brains just stop working correctly.  My mother eventually became completely helpless.
Sure!

For example if, when going thru the list at the store there's no crossing out of items already in the bag.  If the list is confusing, not written very clearly, too jumbled, too complicated, cursive rather than printed.  

Probably more than that though, *the items on the shelves* *are confusing*.  Some words too big, some words too small, everything looks the same.  So many colours so many fonts so many fancy words, all screaming at you.  Whole isles of things that look pretty much the same.   And heck, in the shower without my glasses on, I CAN'T read which is conditioner which is shampoo, need magnifying glass.  

 My mum, she'll go for something she at least recognises.   Need laundry detergent?  She'd get confused by all the different products, come back with dishwashing detergent.    Need the newspaper and milk?   She'll get the paper, then get distracted by tasty looking oranges.  Go back again to  get JUST MILK.  Come back with another newspaper and bread.  Go back again to get JUST MILK.  Come back with yet another newspaper, and margarine.   And this is often WITH a note in her pocket, with the money - !  JUST MILK !.  

Next, she'll be cleaning the kitchen floor with bathroom cleaner.  No big deal - at least its's a cleaning product, what does it matter.  As long as she doesn't use it as shampoo, right?   Whatever -  Roll with it.",2021-05-13 08:23:10,,nbfdur
Alzheimers,I’m having bad thoughts about my grandma (67),I still live with my.

Many, if not most, people who have faced the same reality you're facing have had these thoughts, even when there's no abuse involved.
Yes, this is insanely difficult even when the person isn't abusive. You just have another layer on your challenge don't feel bad about these thoughts.
It's normal. It's OK.
100% Normal
a lot of people might say that anyone with alzheimers is better off dead at a certain point, even if they arent abusive. its a terrible disease and nearly every familial caregiver thinks this at some point, either sympathetically or out of resentment. its fine to feel this way.
It’s normal. Sometimes I feel like my grandma would be better off in a nursing home, which sounds terrible but my family and I aren’t trained caregivers
I hope you can seek out help and support too.  Your mom sounds like she needs it (Office for the Aging in US/Heath Dept. for respite care, support groups, etc.).

Alzheimers,"First My Mom, Now My Dad (I Think). I'm The Only Family Around.","Hi Folks. I've been reading through the posts and I feel for all you, we are in this together! I would love some advice, but just having a place to vent is great as well.

My mother (70) started showing symptoms about a year ago, and it is progressed VERY rapidly. My dad has been great with her, even though they don't have the closest of relationships. I've been making a point to head over to visit and cook dinner once or twice a week, knowing that loneliness is a major factor.

My father has always been stoic and calm, but has started throwing these incredibly uncharacteristic tantrums. From what I've been reading, this could very well be the onset of dementia. I'm worried that living together may be exacerbating his mental decline, but my mom has always been very dependent on him.

I am their only child, and we aren't very close (physically or emotionally) to our small, extended family. I don't have the money for a care facility, nor do I have room in my home. They have a few, dear friends in the area that are essential to their happiness, so I can't buy a place for us outside the city where I can afford the space. This has all happened so suddenly.

On a selfish note, I'm 35 and my career is starting to take off, and I don't think my parents will have the capacity to be proud of my accomplishments. I never knew how much that meant to me...","I know this is hard and I feel so bad for what you are going thru.  Can you get your dad to a doctor for a diagnosis.  See if there is adult day care in your area too.  If your mom could go there all day your dad would have a break.  Contact your local area agency on aging.  They are usually fairly useless, but every now and then they have some nugget of wisdom.      You probably need to talk to a lawyer about power of attorney before it’s too late and you have to have them declared incompetent.  I’m sorry about them not knowing or understanding about your career.  Good luck.

Alzheimers,Thoughts on Ketogenic Diets for Alz?,"Hi everyone - my mom is recently diagnosed early stage and is currently enrolled in a clinical drug trial. Taking things day by day, as we're all still processing and adjusting to the diagnosis and what it means. 

I've been reading various articles and studies about the possibility of diet playing a role in risk for AD and even seen the Alzheimer's Association post about it recently. My understanding of these theories is that there's a possibility the brain of those with Alz can't metabolize glucose and carbs, so eating those items muddles the brain and doesn't give it proper nutrition. The solution to this in theory is a diet very low in glucose and carbs are high in proteins and fats – allowing the brain to then be in ketosis and able to metabolize the energy it needs to properly function. 

When I read about these studies and theories, a lightbulb in my own brain went off, as my mom essentially only eats carbs and glucose and has done so her whole life. She eats very healthy, but what if her brain wasn't able to metabolize the food she was putting in her body even if it was considered ""healthy"" and it has contributed to the Alz? I thought we might as well try shifting her diet to keto as these trials are doing, while she's currently in the drug trial, however of course a keto diet is very difficult to follow properly and even harder when change is difficult for someone with dementia. 

Does anyone have insight into these studies or thoughts on this? Has anyone tried something similar with a loved one? I know a generally brain healthy diet can't hurt, but a strict keto diet could really affect her quality of life since it requires a big commitment and makes meal time more difficult, so I'm asking myself if it's worth it. Like I'm sure many of you are, I'm grasping on to any little sliver of hope and given her lifelong diet this seemed logical to me to give it a shot.","When I was reading about diet and things we could do I decided to just feel my dad healthyish stuff. He already has Alzheimer's so we can't get rid of it. It's a terminal disease so I prefer to give him stuff that brings him joy. 

The things I read up on keto in regards to my health weren't great due to my having cancer and it not compatible with my treatment. Plus my dad enjoys Snickers bars so we buy mini ones and he gets that occasionally.
Its difficult to completely change a older persons diet especially when it's all they know older people are so stubborn. My mother in law is the same but she has accepted cutting back on some sugar and going more sugar free and eating foods with less carbs.(low carb bread/tortillas etc) She will never go full ketosis she is lactose intolerant and cheese is a big part of the diet it seems and she is very picky when it comes to food. She still eats sweets and carbs but it's less at least. She is still at a point where she can make food though for herself. Early onset.

Her son/my partner is starting to go full keto because he is scared of getting alzheimer's. So maybe to help yourself and your family member you should go keto to understand it and at least try to get them to eat less carbs and sugar and possibly even transition them to keto.",2021-05-10 16:02:51,sylvieg11,n9el9w
Alzheimers,Anger since my Dad's license was revoked,"Hey all, this is my first ever post on reddit - I searched up this group on a whim after a couple years of feeling intensely isolated with regards to my experience, and am really grateful to have read the stories posted here. This will be a somewhat lengthy post, but I am really hoping that someone will be able to give me some advice.

My dad is 74, and is in the mid-stage of ALZ. His working memory is non-functional - he forgets anything you tell him instantly, repeats himself over and over, has lost his attention span and interest in activities, and gets obsessive over things that are causing him anxiety. He is very withdrawn, doesn't contribute much to conversation as he struggles to follow it, but still has his sense of humour and is happy to see me and be involved in whatever is happening in the house.

2 months ago he took a memory test which he has been taking regularly to chart the progression of his disease (I can't recall the name of the test, sorry), and he scored 15/30. This score indicates that a person is no longer safe to operate a car, and his doctor had him sit a driving test to confirm this, which he failed. His license was suspended, and he has to sit another test with a written component if he wants his license back, which he will not be able to pass.

I live 3 hours away from my parents, and unfortunately can only get down to visit once a month - my last trip down was only a couple of days after this all went down, and he was understandably very upset and was stuck in a loop of: not knowing that his license had been taken -> not knowing -why- his license had been taken -> understanding why, including all the implications - which was deeply, deeply upsetting to watch. My Mum was able to placate him to an extent by buying him a bike so that he was still able to get up to the local shops, and although he was still upset, this seemed to help him accept his situation a little better.

I was ill for a couple weeks around the time I was scheduled to visit the following month, so I missed that visit. My most recent trip down was this past weekend, 2 months after the license revocation, and his disease was advanced noticeably during this time. He is now completely fixated on the loss of his license, but where before he was depressed and had some level of understanding about it, he is now angry, paranoid, and in denial that he is unable to drive. When he asks ""was there some kind of driving test I have to take?"", my Mum tries to explain to him that yes, she has booked him a test for 4 weeks from now and that he will have to take it if he wants to drive again. From that point the loop is: asking why the license was taken -> asking why he had to take a memory test -> not believing my Mum when she tells him that his memory has been failing for some time etc -> becoming angry and implying that he is being lied to -> storming around and slamming things. My Mum is doing her best to remain patient, but she is mentally and physically fatigued from living with these constant loops and repetitions, and is prone to lose her patience, which I know is the wrong thing to do but is completely understandable considering her situation. My Dad no longer seems to realise that he has ALZ, and  clearly feels that he is being abused and manipulated, which makes his baseline anxiety worse.

My question is this: what is the best course of action to try and soothe my Dad when he gets into this particular obsessive loop? I know that in many cases telling the truth is unhelpful, but I can't think of a lie that would both satisfy him and prevent him from trying to drive and getting caught up in the same loop again. This is mostly for my Mum, as she is the person who is dealing with the vast majority of it - any tips or suggestions that would help her to avoid being the focus of his anger would be gratefully accepted.

Happy to answer any questions or provide any clarification.

Thank you very much in advance.","My mom was very stubborn as far as driving.  We had to physically take her car away and tell her it needed repairs.  Eventually she stopped getting upset about it.  
Does your mom drive?  Or do they have bus service nearby?
I always thought it was kind of amusing, my mom wasn’t able to recall much of anything due to Alzheimer’s but man did she remember I took her car keys away for the longest time.

Is the car still where he can see it? If so maybe it could be parked out of sight. No need to remind your dad that his memory is failing, just do your best to move the subject away from whatever he is talking about. With my mom, I would ask her if she would like to fold clothes or have a popsicle... something I knew she liked or was able to help me with would help change her thoughts.
I agree with the other posts here, this was one of the most traumatic things for my mom to realize, as it represented her freedom and ability to function in her mind.  

Her mind and associated behaviors after were so much worse.  It definitely prompted some of that and there was not much we could do.  However, we often would say she would start again after therapy, after new glasses, after doc visit... you get the gist others suggested.
Forgot to share a funny story — a friend had his mom and dad decline at roughly the same time.  His dad kept asking where the car was after he (the dad) had gotten in the last of numerous accidents and so it was retired from service.  

My friend’s dad used to call him every day to ask where he put the car!  This went on and on for many months, and my friend had some amazing coping skills to deal with the calls.

* Drug cartels in Florida took the car as part of a ring to steal only boring and unremarkable cars for drug mules.

* Cuba sent a Castro-armed force to take the car because his wife (Cuban) had spoken badly about Cuba.

* A neighborhood kid moved the car down the block so the others previously mentioned could not find so only for safe keeping.

You get the point.  At the end of my friend’s story each morning he would explain to his father that the CIA and FBI had already located the car and would return it the next day.  And so, like the movie Groundhog Day,” rinse and repeat with another creative explanation. 😅
Wow this sounds exactly like my dad and mom except he’s due for his license test in about a month. I’m scared what will happen to him after that. We did manage to get him on an antidepressant which has helped slightly . Explaining to him that it would help his asthma to be less anxious, finally worked to convince him to take it.",2021-05-11 04:16:27,compost-pile,n9s0xx
Alzheimers,Dad is one week into memory care - Mom is having second thoughts,"After about nine months of a part-time aide and discussing our options for several months, my father (early 70's) was moved into a memory care facility about a week ago. My mom has been caring for my dad for the last seven or so years as his disease has progressed, and he's at the point where being in a facility seems like the right choice (issues with escaping/wandering, getting dressed, hygiene, etc.). Caring for my dad for this long has taken a big mental toll on my mom, not surprisingly.

We were able to get him a room in a facility close to their home that seemed like the best fit of the ones we toured (some virtual, this one in-person by other family members). Now that my mom has visited him in the facility, she thinks he could get better care at home, but it would really require a full time aide at this point. It feels like she's somehow forgotten how difficult and frustrating it is to care for him after only a week of being apart. 

There must be a lot of emotions involved with putting your spouse in a facility, but I think she needs to stay the course (at least for a few months) and let herself decompress from the strain she's been under for so long. Does anyone here have advice I can pass along to help her re-frame the guilt she seems to be feeling? I will visit the facility soon, but I just can't imagine that my mom's life will be any better by immediately jumping back into the caregiver role that has consumed her life for almost a decade.

Any words of wisdom would be sincerely appreciated.","It’s likely defined her life up to this point and she misses him. The care our loved ones get in a Facility pales in comparison to full time care at home. She’s right he “could” get better care with her. The question is “should” he. 

She’s done her part. I’m willing to bet if you asked your father when he was lucid and he truly understood the ask of her at this point, he’d likely say leave him be and let her live her life. He’s only going to get worse. 

The best thing now is for her to get the help she needs. See the doctors she’s put off, attend to her health and well-being. It’s often a tragedy that one parents needs pulls the other into the grave with them. I doubt he’d want that either. 

Best wishes to all of you.
My mom heard a statistic that 63% of caregivers will die before the patient. She shared that with her support group. She told a friend who later reminded her of this statistic who reminded her to take care of herself. 

That was last summer. My mom died suddenly two days before Thanksgiving of a cardiac tamponade due to high blood pressure. I believe the stress of taking care of my father killed her.

I just read a statistic that 70% of caregivers over the age of 70 will die before the patient. 

Please remind your mother that she will be no help to anyone, including her husband, if she doesn’t start taking care of herself. We moved my dad to Memory Care in March. Now nobody in the family is woken up if/when he wakes up multiple times a night. When we are with him, we can spend time with him and enjoy him, rather than being the people who make him shower every morning and make him change his clothes. Try to enjoy being more of a family member than a caregiver. It’s a hard transition for those who have been caregiving for a really long time.

If she were to bring your dad home, and then die herself, it would be harder on your dad moving to a facility after your mom dies. 

Keeping him in the facility is actually the most loving thing she can do for him AND for herself.

Please keep us posted!
We were in the same position a few years ago. Mom felt so guilty after we moved dad in, but in hindsight it was 100% the right decision. It would have been so much harder for him to transition if he had been more progressed at that point and looking back now, my mom says the caretaking was killing her emotionally and mentally. My mom found a wonderful therapist and a support group. It help her shift the focus of what had been her life every single day and take back time for herself.
Do you have out of town siblings or does she have friends or family she'd like to see? Sending her on a vacation could be a great way to go to help her relax & adjust. New scenery can really help her reset.

Or if you know there are other things she might like that she's been neglecting doing because the care was so much, maybe take a pottery class with her grandkids or yoga or anything really. She suddenly has time on her hands and guilt at having shuffled him off. A distraction will help.

But also, remind her that the experts say a care facility adjustment can take about six months. Remind her that all the work it just took to find this place you'd be doing all over again to find live-in care to bring him home. You should give it a few months at least before deciding on a different change & getting to know the people at the provider facility can definitely help improve the attention he gets in the care facility.
I don’t have advice but wanted to share my family is experiencing A similar difficult transition. My dad (66) was just admitted. His Alzheimer’s has progressed rapidly in the last couple years and he needs 24 hour care that my mom has been doing alone—especially thorough covid. 

But he’s having a tough time adjusting and my mom is feeling a lot of guilt and regret. 

I understand why. Some days I feel the same because I supported her decision to move him in the first place. 

But I also know how hard it has been for her this past year attending to him around the clock. I want her to get some of her own life back. 

It’s all so difficult.
Don't do it. When my father started wandering, we started looking at homes to put him in, but the price was astronomical. I proposed finding an elder law attorney to figure out a financial situation that could help but I was shot down by my siblings because they ""don't trust lawyers"". My mom did not say anything and is a very passive person, she has a very ""I'll just deal with it and get through it eventually"" mentality. The best I could do was sign him up for adult day care so that she had some time away from him. But after I left to go home halfway across the country, mom pulled him out and said it was too expensive and that he didn't like it there.

I should have fought everyone harder. I visit her again in four months and she is a completely different person. She's stopped taking care of herself and the house. Garbage everywhere, dirty stove, dirty dishes, flies everywhere. She sleeps most of the day away and does the bare minimum to take care of my dad. When I talk to her, she responds quietly in one word answers. She doesn't have an opinion on anything.

That was three years ago. My sibling has since found a smaller home for them closeby and started helping out, although she has a very short temper and has not been patient with either of them. My father passed two weeks ago. My mom has yet to recover to her former self and I don't know if she ever will. I've been trying to coax her to talk more and open up to me. She basically says that she has no interest in anything anymore and is just waiting to die.
Did she give any details of deficits she saw at the memory care place?  Or is it just a vague feeling of guilt, and let's not forget, of loss.

They say the best way to help your older adult in residential care is to visit often, and talk to the providers.  Since it's close to her home, visiting often shouldn't be too difficult, right?
At my homes it's okay if residents go home for a day and or night. This might help your mom with settling into the new normal. It must suddenly be really quiet at home now.
Please don’t allow medical staff to feed him benzos like lorazepam. They’re known destabilizers & connected in studies w/ femur falls. 

Nasty family members starved mom so we would agree to memory care. They then promptly got her NP to prescribe benzos for anxiety instead of taking mom on daily muscle building/ head clearing 1 mile walks, as we did w/ our dog the summer right before mom was institutionalized. 

99 lb Mom leaned up against wheeled Walker & wheel chair in her room at night & fell so hard she finally busted her femur. No one called 911!! Barbaric!! Sister w/ POA over health refused, as did NP & memory care! Left to rot in bed w/ No morphine given for a week, until hospice killed mom w/ it. Mom wasn’t on hospice when she fell. 

It was just 7 weeks until mom fell & 3 more until she died. 10 weeks total in a god foresaken UT memory care owned by 2 of the 9 daughters of 96 yr old Mormon prophet Doctor Nelson. Elderly are expendable in UT. Including Him! 🥴🤢🤮",2021-05-11 10:09:28,SkinnyJonesJr,n9xusl
Alzheimers,Classic Stumped Town,"Mother's Day not going so great? Here's some classic Stumped Town to make 'ya smile.

[Mother's Day Misery](https://www.stumpedtowndementia.com/post/mother-s-day-dementia-misery) \- What did you get your mom for Mother's Day? We got ours torture.","My week started with my family member breaking her wrist. It’s been other worldly. I’ve been gently woken up multiple times a night with a panicked woman convinced people are at the door, pulling her oxygen tubing apart, or us being late to her already attended doctor’s appointment. 

I had a wonderful surprise Friday morning when she called her daughters and the police department to let them know I had a group of women here with me trying to get her. We have special ear buds to listen in on her and hidden cameras in the bathroom fan. This all happened while I was slumbering in my bed. No one bothered to let me know because I’m obviously a child who couldn’t understand that I might scare her if she saw me. No way I couldn’t have just been dressed and stayed out of sight until they got here. /s

Today, after me putting off a much needed medical treatment for my kidney; had the entire family, along with a feverish (none vaccinated) child come to visit. Luckily I’ve been vaccinated, but my 85 year old grandmother hasn’t. 

Right before the circus was winding down, my grandmother (who has been refusing some of her medications, because I’m obviously drugging her🤦‍♀️) had an “accident” of a number 2 proportion. 

Her daughter needed help, or rather needed me to clean up the poo while she comforted her. It’s been a wonderful week spent with my loving family. 

Happy Mother’s Day everyone. I pray that it was easier for everyone. Can’t wait for the next holiday!
Mom died in December so this was my first mother's day without her. I was struggling really badly yesterday with all the ""isn't your mom the best"" type commercials (and yes, she was). Today was easier. I was going through photo albums, getting ready for her memorial service and found some real gems. She was a pediatrician and I found photos of the preemie she resuscitated as an intern and many photos of that little girl growing up along with many thank you cards from the family. I also found some wonderful 'complaints' that were put in the hospitals complaint box. One said ""We hate (the hospital) but we love doctor (my mom)"" another was expressing concern that my mother needed a bigger desk. Finally I found a photo of her at the department picnic holding a can, she had labeled that photo ""me and somebody's beer"". She didn't drink and that made me LOL.

Hope everyone who is still caring for someone had a peaceful day. Hugs.
She got a bath/torture session in yesterday, but for gifts she got roses, pork fried rice in a cup and lemonade in her sippy cup
My dad is the one with Alzheimer’s. About 2 weeks ago we moved him to a nursing home because he has needed 24 hour care for some time and my mom has been doing it all alone the past year bc covid. 

He is also blind and very restless at night. Getting up and getting agitated. Then being worse during the next day for not having slept. 

Anyway, last Thursday they decided he was not adjusting well to the transition and needed a new psychiatric evaluation so transferred him to a hospital emergency psychiatric unit where he has been ever since, waiting evaluation and placement in a different residential facility. 

My mom has been staying with him at the hospital almost around the clock. 

Saturday she stayed there till almost midnight. Then came and slept at my house bc we are much closer to the hospital than she. But we only have a one bedroom condo so she literally had to sleep on our living room floor. Got back up by 6am to go back there. 

Then she managed to come back for a super quick visit. Maybe 30 mins while he was sleeping before they called her again to see he was a wake and looking for her/getting upset because she wasn’t there. So she rushed back. 

She feels super guilty about admitting him and thinks all of this is her fault and she didn’t even get to see my 5yo, her only grandson bc he was out with my husband when she came by. 

So yeah, hell of a Mother’s Day for all of us.",2021-05-09 13:04:37,LicketyGlitz,n8ih62
Alzheimers,My Grandfather,My grandpa has deteriorated a lot recently and it’s been pretty rough. He moved in with me and my family a month or so ago and there has recently been some issues. My mom thinks I might be his “trigger person.” The other week I came home and walked in and at first he thought someone broke in and messed up our living room but he was otherwise unbothered that I was there. I tried to explain to him that it was my younger brother who is a huge mess maker and had been playing with a close friend earlier that day but he didn’t believe it and didn’t remember my brother. Then he claimed it was me or one of my friends and had issues recognizing me so he walked over to the neighbors house and tried to get them to call my mom because he didn’t trust me. When we got back to our house after he had contacted my mom he locked me out because he didn’t trust me and was going to “let the police handle it.” I understand that it’s not his fault and it’s a disease but it has been really rough. He has been very emotional because his girlfriend of 30+ years passed away a few weeks ago. We are looking into a home but we’re not sure how it’ll go. He thinks that it’s his house and he also has had issues when he tries to feed my dog but we can’t just feed her whatever because she is older and has underlying health issues. It’s just been troubling me for awhile and I just wanted to put it out there I guess. Sorry for the ramble and i know it’s all over the place and hard to follow but I just wanted to know if anyone had similar experiences and how to deal with it? Thank you so much.,"I'm sorry things are changing so much and so unpredictably.  Be sure to let your parents know how this is affecting you, but do it in a calm and measured voice, or it will just increase their stress.  If these issues can't be worked out with your Grandpa, he might have to go to a facility where they are very experienced working with older adults.  You can't be getting locked out, and it's not fair for your dog to have her feeding issues ignored.",2021-05-09 01:01:04,Old-Blacksmith-8103,n870mq
Alzheimers,testing,[I  am fairly certain my wife is in the early stages of alzheimers or  dimentia...i have not talked to her about it...i would love advise on  how to address it or get her to a doctor for tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersGroup/comments/n7vfd0/i_am_fairly_certain_my_wife_is_in_the_early/),"Others may have better advice than me, but is she still coherent and realizes this is happening or that you think it is?   Have you talked with her?  Maybe a silly question and you have tried.  You could call her doctor to say you have concerns, devise a reason other than mild-cognitive impairment or dementia concerns.  His old is she?
The first step is talking to her regular dr first. From there, they can refer to a neurologist who can do some basic testing to see if she is indeed showing signs.
I would talk to your wife first though. Of course, thats a hard conversation but better to know sooner rather than later if it is, OR rule it out and figure out what else may be happenjng.
Good luck. Big hug.
If it runs in her family you could suggest it as a baseline test in case of future decline. You could ask for one yourself if you have any risk factors, have a meal afterward and make a fun day out of it, covid permitting.",2021-05-08 14:57:03,pomannn,n7vxgl
Alzheimers,Finishing sentences.,"He everyone. My dad is 59 and he doesn't have Alzheimers. I've just got a question about it. Your memory slowly getting worse is just something that happens when you get older and that's happening to my dad a little. My question is that when we discuss things like sports, movies, music, sometimes he'll forget the name of a song or an actor or a movie. Like he'll say ""my favourite song from that album is, ugh what's it called?"" Then he'll sing a bit of the lyrics or something. I know what he's talking about so I say the name of the song. There's been quite a few times where he's forgotten the name of something and he's trying to figure it out himself and if I gave him a few extra seconds, he would but I just tell him what he's trying to remember. Is it good to tell him or should I let him figure it out? I'm just wondering if what I'm doing can in anyway lead to problems or if I'm actually helping. Thanks.","You are not doing anything that will cause problems, so don’t feel like you need to change. Helping people to recall things is a good thing, as long as you give them the opportunity to do so without rushing them or making a big deal out of it. If you are concerned about his memory, you can encourage a handful of things that will promote memory recall. Physical activity, mental stimulation(puzzles, games, etc), socializing, sleeping and eating well, etc, are relatively easy things to incorporate into his daily life.

If you are really worried about his cognition, and the possibility of dementia or things getting worse, then a visit to the doctor is probably in order.
I read an article years ago that made sense to me. I can't remember where or when I read the article and I'm 57, sooooo you know. As older people we have learned and experienced and processed billions of bits of information. Therefore, when we go to retrieve a memory, we must sift through many layers of information to get to that song title. It takes a bit sometimes! If you remember it first, that's great. Just ask yourself how many lyrics your dad remembers compared to how many you've even heard. He's fine.
Soo...I'm 58 and have the same issues as your Dad. Occasionally the name of some random thing escapes me. This is called lethologica and it's entirely normal. Alzheimer's is a group of symptoms that include the inability to make or keep new memories amongst other things. If you notice personality changes in your Dad or the inability to remember what he did yesterday or what he had for breakfast or what day it is then you probably have something to be concerned with and should schedule an appt with a neurologist. For my part I appreciate it when someone helps me out when I'm stuck lol

Alzheimers,introducing your loved one to a hired companion for the first time ever - how did that work out for you and them?,"I’m trying to convince myself it’s time to hire outside help for my mother, because I can’t do it all alone (surprise!) and she misses social interaction desperately.  And I’m prepared to say to her, as bad as it might make her feel, that I want someone around the house while I’m not because I would just feel safer knowing that she’s not alone.  How did your experience go?  Can you share any tips or tricks?  TIA!","I worded it to my dad more like we were hiring someone to help around the house and keep him company. It will still take some getting comfortable with, but now my dad loves having someone around the house.
Introduce the companion as a friend of yours, have them do a task/activity with your mum on the 1st visit then sit down for a coffee with you. On the next visit they stay longer and you go out (even if you just sit in your car for an hour) and build from there.

My dads companion is with him 2 x 3 hours a week, and was by complete coincidence a classmate of my sisters so introducing him was easy. Their activities vary each week but can include: going out for a bacon buttie, visiting diy stores, jobs in the garden and just talking over a cup of tea.
I also introduce as a friend. I ask them not to wear scrubs because my Dad doesn’t think he needs help. I have them hang out a bit while I’m there. I usually tell him they are there to make him lunch and hang out. Has worked really well!
My sister and I called these “rent-a-friends” 😂 Not to my mother of course, but humor helps. We said the same thing as others commenting have said, someone coming in to help with chores around house, upkeep etc.  

However, as anticipated, she would not let them do anything!  She was so routine oriented it was one of the only ways for her to feel normal even if lifting things and doing laundry etc. were dangerous because she fell a lot.  She also started combining food in unhealthy ways.  Eek! 

All this is to say OP, do not expect too much!  it may well just this way, as it did for us.  It can work well to just get someone there.  My mom  sat and watched old movies with them and became very attached right away!  Good luck!

Alzheimers,I’m Young and Don’t Know What to Do,"Hi, I really hope I’m in the right place, and that I don’t sound like a monster.

My grandmother has Alzheimer’s. I’d say it’s mid-stage, and she needs someone at home with her at all times. The symptoms are all textbook, and I won’t go on about how horrible it is.

I’ve lived with her, my mom, and my aunt since I was 6 and I’m 20 now. I’m in college several hours away, but I’m home during the summer. I have very high hopes for my career—I’m a cellist and I’m often very busy with school, but it feels like my home situation is sucking the life out of me, and that my young years are being wasted due to this.

It’s a devastating disease to watch, and I do not have the emotional capacity to deal with this. I love my grandma, and I always will, but she’s not really here anymore. I’ve been emotionally preparing myself for what’s to come for years now. I never know what I’ll come home to each semester. 

I want to move away from home permanently and get on my feet, because my career and my hopes and dreams are so important to me. My aunt is retired (and an alcoholic) and my mom is unemployed, and I have no other family. I want to save my mom and myself and live a peaceful life. It’s hard on my mom’s mental health; she can barely function. It sounds so awful and selfish, but I’m just so young and I want to enjoy my life. My childhood was extremely traumatic; my mom and I were both abused by my dad. My mom doesn’t deserve to live like this either. I wish someone could just save me from this.","I’m so sorry. It’s not fair. Go, live your life. Your grandma would want that. Do not sacrifice your life to guilt or fear. It will be hard enough. Doing well for yourself will allow you to have a chance to be there for your mom and aunt eventually.  Stay focused on making a healthy, positive life for yourself.
Is a placement possible for your grandma? Does she have any property or assets in her name? If you or your mom can get power of attorney for her, look at places with Medicaid beds available. They’re not as nice as private memory care facilities, but most communities have at least a few decent facilities with Medicaid beds. She can’t have any property or assets, beyond Social Security, etc, in her name. Medicaid will do a five year look back for that.  

Early 50’s here. My mom is moving from moderate to more severe, and I’m basically the only relative who will care what happens to her. She’s going to be placed sometime this summer. Fortunately, my parents planned ahead and there’s funding set aside for her care. 

Talk to your mom about it, and then find a social worker, support group or advocate to get help and make a plan. Both you and your mom deserve a life. Having her placed will give your mom a break and you a shot at life.
Jeez, sorry to hear about your situation. So it's totally understandable that you want yourself and your mom to be stable, but you have to remember that that's her mom, and ultimately it's up to her what she chooses to do. She may feel obligated to live with her mom and care for her, especially knowing your aunt is an alcoholic, assuming those two are the only ones who would be able to care for her. 

You said that your mom is unemployed. If you're in the U.S. then she'd be able to be paid for caring for your grandmother. You could look into that. I think it's fair for you, as the grandchild of a person with Alzheimer's to want to be on your own and focus on your own life. Alzheimer's is a draining, devastating, and sad disease and even being around it during just summers could really affect your mental health. Have you talked to your mom about any of this?
Learning a great deal from these posts — makes me feel sad to share in this fate, but it helps to know one is not alone. Thank you all.",2021-05-06 22:11:13,killing_carlo,n6nvyh
Alzheimers,At a loss on how to cope and deal with my In-Law’s Alzheimer’s Disease,"Hi everyone! I’m new to this group, and have recently joined seeking much needed advice and/or support from others that have more experience in dealing with Alzheimer’s disease. 

Both of my in laws have been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and it is rapidly progressing. My husband is the one that deals with absolutely everything pertaining to their needs, wants, appointment, finances, etc. They now heavily rely on him for everything. The issue is that my father in law calls my husband on average about 10-20 times a day, and it is taking a huge toll on my husband both mentally and emotionally. Many, if not most of the phone calls are to repeat the same information that has already been given to him. My husband is burning out pretty badly and it is affecting his work, his moods, his relationships and most importantly, his well being. My father in law really struggles with anxiety and whenever he has any upcoming appointments (which is very often, if not everyday), he needs constant reassurance and repeating of the times, dates and details of all the appointments and subsequent information given. 

I’m at a total loss on how to deal with things and am struggling to cope. I don’t even deal with a quarter of what my husband does, and I have lately been feeling like I’m at a total loss on how to deal with this. 

My question to you all, as a community, how do you cope with loved ones suffering from this disease? What, if anything, can help them to worry less and thrive better with this disease? Is there any suggestions on things that can be done to help them rely a little less on us, to ease the burden? Any suggestions on utilizing anything to help them to worry less and help them to remember upcoming appointments? 

We bought them a whiteboard to do a daily schedule on, just to cover the upcoming day, to keep it simple. My husband will give him a call daily and get him to write down the events for the following day, although we are both worried that it will only be more confusing for him or he won’t remember to utilize it. 

We want them to thrive and do the best they can, with the circumstances. We do everything in our power to make sure they are looked after and keep them as happy and comfortable as possible. They both live together in a retirement home, but are not yet to the point that they need around the clock assisted care. Unfortunately because they are not yet at that point, they heavily rely on my husband for everything, but we want to try and delay their move to special care as long as possible because when they do, they will not only be potentially separated (sleeping in separate rooms), but it is a hospital-like setting and we worry their cognition and well-being would decline much more rapidly once they are there. We moved them to our city over Christmas and got them into the best retirement facility in the city, with the nicest, biggest and best suite possible and even with that, they aren’t happy, so I can only imagine how they would cope or feel in extended care. 

Any tips, tricks, suggestions, advice or support is VERY much appreciated and I’m grateful for anyone taking the time to read this. Thank you.","You have my sympathy. I never thought I would say this but I'm glad my Mom passed away a few years ago and is not going through this or seeing my Dad turn into this shell of his former self. It sounds like he's farther along than your in-laws. I don't think he could use a phone right now to save himself.

One thing I would try with your FIL is a call schedule. You set a simple schedule he can follow. Explain that it's not that his concerns aren't important but that your husband needs to work and has to follow a schedule too. Show him that your husband has a calendar and that on that calendar are call times scheduled every day with his Dad along with lots of other things on his busy, busy schedule (hint hint). YOU HAVE TO BE FIRM BUT PATIENT. This may be a unique part of my Dads disease progression but he likes to feel like he has a job to do. Cut up cardboard for recycling or brush the dog. These little busy jobs are scheduled and have become important because in his mind he's working and adds value. 

Another thing to consider is home health care. You can have a home care provider visit them for a couple hours a day or a couple hours a week. If you get lucky, like I have, they will be great (it's been my experience that most of these people are wonderful) and become good friends. In my case they help Dad to bathe. This was becoming a problem for us as he didn't want to so to over come it we made a schedule. Twice a week at the same time on the same days. It works. There's never any question as long as I remind him beforehand. They are able to do a wide range of things and might be worth looking into to provide some distraction for your in-laws. 

My situation is very different as he and I live together now. He would not be happy in a home either but I'm single and my kids are grown up, I have the time and I can more easily manage things for him. 

Things I have learned:

Not everything needs to be heard/answered/corrected. My Dad seems to create a story in his mind about things. We watch a lot of youtube videos and it seems to makes him more comfortable to create a story about the people in the video. Like he will say ""Oh that must be his wife"" about a completely unrelated woman that just happens to be on screen. I think this is an unintentional external verbalization of what was intended as internal dialogue. If he's not looking at me when he says something like this I ignore it.

Patience and creative but gentle explanations of things seem to work well for me...at least for now. We have good days and bad days. On good days we laugh still. On bad days he yells at me because he misunderstood something.

Then there are the moments of clarity when he's scared because he knows in this momentary clearing of his thoughts that somethings just not right and he can't fix it.

Alzheimers,Wages for Home Care,"Hey, all. I hope this is the right place for this post.

My sister and I are hiring an in-home care worker for my mom, whose Alzheimer's is rapidly advancing.

We're wondering how overnight workers are typically paid? Are they paid hourly like daytime workers? Or are they paid differently given that a big chunk of the night they're sleeping (though on call).","Are you hiring a singular individual or going through a company?

My experience was most companies told me they had 2 care workers come in shifts at night because it was difficult to find a person willing to do a full overnight. I don't believe they sleep either because if you're hiring someone for a night shift that means there is the possibility of them being active at night. (My dad tends to not sleep until 3-5AM. Thankfully my brother is at home though so we don't have night time workers)

The companies I spoke to pretty much had a flat rate based on the number of hours you needed care (4 hours or less cost more) and it didn't change between day or night. For me in Michigan I'm paying $25/hr.  

Whatever you end up doing, make sure to shop around, ask a lot of questions, and if you don't like who you go with, don't feel bad taking your business elsewhere.
I can only comment on my 1 experience, they make the same as daytime. Weekends are priced slightly higher. I wouldn’t assume they are sleeping either. If they are, then I would think the rate should be lower.
25/hour
In my area of Vermont, overnight caregivers from agencies were around $30 an hour and they were paid hourly and worked in shifts. I never looked into private as that route requires you to pay their employment taxes. With the around-the-clock care my mom needs (she wanders and only sleeps about 2 hours a night usually), it was cheaper to move her into a private pay memory care that was around $7,000 a month for 24/7 care, meals, activities, etc.
i am a care worker in MA and the (government funded) agency that allocates my clients PCA hours will only pay for 3 hours for overnight PCAs (midnight-6am). so regular pay for 6am-11:59pm, then 3 hours for anyone doing a 12-6am shift. 

ive also seen agencies where pay is cut in half for nights but i think its more normal to only pay for 3-4 hours for overnight work IF they are allowed to rest on shift. 

if the person being cared for is nocturnal and up all night, or they are expected to do chores or other duties during their night shift, they should absolutely be paid every hour they are on the clock. only reduce night pay if they are allowed/expected to spend most of the time resting.",2021-05-06 15:38:06,daycounteragain,n6fm65

Alzheimers,I am curious if your parents or grandparents had Type 2 Diabetes? The research is saying that about 30% of Type 2 Diabetes goes on to develop Dementia (cross posted by another in dementia sub),,"No Type 2, but poor diet very high in simple carbohydrates and sugar. My personal research that I’ve done tells me there’s a correlation.
No, but this episode was fascinating with links between diet and brain health 

https://open.spotify.com/episode/2j0SStG2wnTLNEjxuNGwXp?si=2d8K4TnVRJ6wcVwBhsXW9Q
My mom didn't. She also grew up eating nothing more than fish, rarely eats red meat, and loves vegetables. I have seen studies that think Alzheimer's might be a type-3 diabetes, but my mom's blood sugars have always tested fine. The fact that she grew up eating seafood and nothing else has always made me question mercury.
Yes my grandfather was diagnosed type 2 many years before his diagnosis.
Yes my mom was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and has been a type 2 diabetic for about 15 years
My grandfather who is in the last stage of Alzheimer's has had type 2 Diabetes for the last 30 years. 

Unfortunately his condition has it made it even more difficult to control, with his blood glucose range being between 3.5 and 14.5 sporadically throughout the day. 

I do genuinely wonder if theres a correlation.

Alzheimers,Need help/advice on meeting someone with Alzheimer’s for the first time,"Hi everyone. As the title says, I need some advice about meeting someone with Alzheimer’s for the first time. It’s my boyfriends mother. We’ve been dating for about a month now, and I have yet to meet her (although I do want to!) I grew up with my grandparents so I know how to act/treat older people with respect and kindness, but I’d be lying if I said I am a bit worried about meeting her. I’m hesitant about how to act and what to say, and above all I want to make sure I don’t hurt my boyfriends feelings or make him feel awkward about it. I really care for him a lot, and I can see the pain in his eyes when I ask him how his mom is doing. Apparently she is quite advanced in her Alzheimer’s, so she most likely won’t remember me at all, but that’s no excuse. I’d be really grateful if anyone could give me some tips or share their own experiences!

Edit: Thanks to everyone who has responded so far! You have all given me great advice and I really feel much more prepared than I did before. :)","Be prepared not to take anything personally. Go with the flow, and don't be afraid to ask her easy questions or have to re-answer the same question a ton of times. One thing I loved when visiting my mom with my husband was when he would swoop in with mindless chatter when I got emotional over something she'd say. Just making basic small talk, being nice, and being patient will go a long way. She might be more advanced and not really able to interact much at all. Just holding his hand or physically being there with him can be a comfort. She may act erratically, making noises or movements that make you uncomfortable. Often there isn't anything that really can be done, so just staying calm and trying to de-escalate any situations is sometimes the best that can be done.
My Dad has alzheimer's, and I take care of him. I would say the most important thing is... to be kind. And... it is important to not get impatient with them. Like... you may end up having the same conversation over and over again, and.... that is okay. They can't help not remembering. You have to meet them where they ARE, not where you want them to be. As long as they are happy and not embarrassed/ashamed about it, that is what matters. 

Also... sometimes it takes me Dad awhile to think of the right words to say what he wants. So I make sure to give him the time to think of what he is going to say without interrupting him. (So what might be a looong awkward pause to others might be an appropriate amount of thinking time for him.) Everyone is different of course, but... those are things I like to do.

Also... the oldest memories last the longest. For awhile my Dad couldn't tell you anything about that day but he could talk about his childhood for hours. (He is too advanced for that now, sadly.) Getting someone to tell old stories about the past can be fun.

Anyway, I am sure you will do great! Nice you get to meet her.
Don’t take anything personally. You shall likely have to introduce yourself every time you see her, and she may not have filters.  For example, if you’re heavy, she may tell your boyfriend “she’s fat.”  Don’t take it personally. The filters are often gone.
Smile, be nice, and don’t take anything to heart. There’s a chance she could be really mean to you - try to remember it’s not her, it’s the disease
I think its hard to give advice because Alzheimer's progresses a little differently for everyone. Realistically, just be kind and patient and most importantly be yourself.
I agree. Don't take anything she says personally. My mom will say the most inappropriate things and has told people, including us, that they're too fat, have a funny face, smell weird, or think they're so clever and they aren't. You also could face being accused of stealing her things, being an intruder, etc. My mom used to accuse my SIL of stealing her bras, even though my mom was throwing them away or hiding them in weird places. You just have to smile and nod. If it gets to be too much, it's best to make an excuse and go outside for fresh air.
Smile. Body language is important. Don’t be afraid of her. She’s just a person with a disease. Remember the person part and  you will be fine. the rest is just the Alzheimer’s.
speak clearly, but not loudly if she doesnt have hearing issues. people always shout at people with alzheimers thinking they cant hear well since they respond to most things with “what?” but in actuality their hearing is usually fine, its their comprehension thats the issue. 

so speak clearly, speak in short sentences and don’t whip out the big vocabulary. keep stories and anecdotes very short and make good eye contact. they will look to your face and body expressions to understand you better so be physically expressive! and no need to be nervous :)
Tone of voice is important.  Especially with late stage Alzheimer’s.  They respond well to kindness and reassurance.  Don’t assume she understands or follows what is being said.  But that’s okay.  Sometimes there could be mood swings.  Don’t take that personally.  Don’t touch her unless it seems that is what she wants.  A lot of time those with Alzheimer’s hate being touched.  

Expect her to repeat comments or questions frequently.",2021-05-04 23:38:05,littleladym19,n56dgl

Alzheimers,Advice Needed,"81 year old Mom was dx'ed with mid level Alz.   Dr. said she failed tests many 2nd graders would pass and has the cognition level of a 7 year old, but I'm having a hard time reconciling what the Dr says with what I see.  

I'm not in denial, but I feel like she should have more symptoms than forgetting people's names.  Mom is very aware that she's got memory loss but my impression was that with Alz the short term memory is the first to go.  I wouldn't expect her to recall a Dr's appointment with a dementia Dr that she had a week ago, for instance, but she does.  I wouldn't expect her to tell me her cousin called her to wish her a happy birthday, I wouldn't expect her to remember that her friend had spent a week at her son's house to take care of his pets while he traveled.   

The Dr. kept saying it's not what she CAN remember, but what she CAN'T remember and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this.  What am I missing?","I'm willing to bet your mom has a lot of coping techniques to help keep her going that make it hard to recognize. Especially if you are part of her normal routine.

Mine is well into mid-stage but you could meet her on a good day and you might not guess it. Some short-term stuff sticks (like she'll remember she's got a doctor's appt. coming up, but not who with or what it is for.) She still has decent recall of major events from her past, but she loses little, common things like being able to recognize the vegetable she wants at a grocery store or how to make tacos.

Last year, she could tell you who was running for President, but she was very confused about their platforms and who to vote for and why. She's also lost situational awareness that means she falls for most of the scammers that get to her - if they can put on a front as though they are there to help her, she assumes they are honest. Her latest development is a decline in impulse control.

And it's particularly obvious in her emails and facebook posts, she used to be a strong writer and now she struggles to string together 2nd grade level sentences, including being on topic.

It really can manifest in different ways for different people - all our neural pathways are unique. And you may also have adaptive techniques - like anticipating her needs or completing her sentences - that mean you're covering it yourself. If you watch, it'll likely become more prominent.

I'm sorry she got the diagnosis. This disease is no fun.
Everyone has a different dementia journey  and this can vary within the diagnosis. 

Have you heard the bookcase analogy?

Imagine everything in your brain is stored in a huge bookcase, the books vary in size, colour and what they represent: so 1 book could just contain your wedding and the next book the previous 2 years of your life. The bookcase fills from the bottom and the last book is always short-term memory.

As the dementia progresses the bookcase becomes more unstable short-term memory and very recent books are usually the first to fall but for some people it's all the books that contain family holidays, for some it's their personality, for a rare few it's the ability to walk and talk. Dementia can vary in so many ways.
While there’s usually a lot of similarities between cases, some don’t always fit the norm. The thing I’ve had to remind myself personally is, you can’t make sense out of something that makes no sense. 

Sometimes when my mom says/does something new, my sister will try to figure out what it means and why her brain is processing like that- but I think a lot of times there is no reason, no processing, or at least very flawed processing going on. 

It’s always possible she was misdiagnosed, but it’s also possible that her brain is currently affected in a way that doesn’t fit what you’d expect from an Alzheimer’s patient.",2021-05-04 12:30:21,New2ThisSubThrowaway,n4snr9

Alzheimers,"My grandma is in the early stages of Alzheimers, I'm contemplating listening to ""Everywhere at the End of Time""","Would this be a good idea? On the one side, I think it will help me understand what she's going trough and might help me understand her needs etc better. On the other hand, I'm kind of scared that it will completely horrify me and make me super depressed. Could I get your guys take on this? Thank you in advance.","I wouldn't listen to it. If you want information on what's she's going through, honestly just read through this subreddit. There is a ton of information here and stories from tons of people all going through the same thing. Maybe down the road you could listen to it but coming from someone who's listened to it, I'd advise against it right now.
It depends on how you may absorb the info. Once my grandma was officially diagnosed, I honestly avoided doing research for awhile. It wasn’t because I didn’t accept it (she got diagnosed in stage 2 due to a shit load of reasons I don’t feel like typing) but because I didn’t want to face reality of what will happen. 

Once I started doing research on my own time, I felt comfortable enough to explore other sources. I’m not a main caregiver but I currently live with her and my family. I started my research and looked at what I could do at the moment with her. I’m an artist and I’m moving soon so right now I’ve been “including her” on some decor stuff and we’re making some art together that she is able to do. 

It also helps if you have a person who you can just rant to you or even a therapist. It will be extremely hard and it only gets harder so my advice to you is to ease yourself into the information so when shit hits the fan you’re prepared. A great example is how my grandma is currently on a wait list for an aid or nurse. I’m in NJ and the demand is so high right now. If we reached out a few months earlier, things wouldn’t be as hard as they are now. 

Some things can be prevented from being much more difficult down the line through research. Start slow, have a support group (online or in person if needed), give yourself a break, and take it a day at a time.
If your trying to understand the disease from another perspective go for it. It will most definitely make you depressed. Thats unfortunately the magnitude of Alzheimer's.",2021-05-04 05:25:35,phlyder,n4k438

Alzheimers,Advice for Connecting With Relatives With Alzheimer’s From Long Distance?,"My grandma is in her late 70s and has been in assisted care for about seven years and has been in a memory care facility for the past two and a half years. The facility is close to my cousins and they visit her a few times a week (now that they’re all vaccinated) but I live a few hours away and due to school and work can’t see her more than a few times a year. I try to call her once a week but she never picks up. Her caretakers or my cousins will play her answering machine for her once in awhile, so I leave her a message, but it’s not the same as actually getting to talk to her. On the few occasions I do get to talk to her, it’s really difficult. She doesn’t have much short or long term memory and has lost a lot of weight and a few teeth. Overall she seems to be content, but doesn’t have much awareness of what’s going on around her. She is a really incredible, smart, funny woman and I’ll try and remind her of stories she told me when I was little or talk to her about how my college classes are going, but she just sort of smiles and says “That’s wonderful” or “How exciting” to everything. Does anyone have advice on how to engage with her more? I know that we won’t have huge deep conversations and she won’t be the same as she used to be, but I want to try and entertain her or have some sort of real conversation if possible. Her days are pretty monotonous (not that she remembers what happened the day before anyways) and that just makes me really sad, especially since I’m not able to spend much time with her in person. Is trying to remind someone with Alzheimer’s of stories/events that they no longer remember helpful? I’ll usually try and talk to her about stories she told me from her college days, but I don’t want to confuse her or stress her out. What are some things people have found helpful when talking to family members with Alzheimer’s? If anyone has advice on connecting with people when you can’t see them in person that would be incredibly helpful as well. My grandma’s physical health has been declining over the past year and although she’s survived through a lot, I know that her days are starting to come to a close and I just want to spend as much (virtual) time with her as I can. I’ve thought about sending her letters and photo books or maybe making her playlists but I’m not totally sure how I would get them to her or how much of an impact they would have. I’d love to know what other people have found helpful in situations like this!","I would not worry about engaging her, just tell her about yourself.  She enjoys that!  I would not say anything like “do you remember” but instead just tell stories of the past (for example, “when I was little, you loved to read me books).  

Talk slowly, take pauses... simple and clear.  She may or may not recognize the stories or truly understand what you say.  However, she will love hearing you talk to her and spend that time with her.  

You could also make a sample picture book for her, she would love that.  All you do to spend time with her on some way is all that matters in my experience.  I hope this helps!  And so glad you are doing this for her.
Is there any way to get the caregivers to answer the phone and hand it to her?  Where my mom was, they would gladly put mom on the phone if someone called to speak with her.  

Being the closer sibling geographically, I would also face time call my brother when I'd visit so that he could speak with her.  We didn't always connect but my mom loved it.  You might ask your relatives if they could \[video\] call you when they visit, and give her the phone so you could visit with her too. 

As far as conversation, try to avoid open ended questions that require recall.  If you get a positive response with a subject, you can even bring it up again later during your visit - and also file it away for use next time.  She won't notice the redundancy at all.  A few supportive communication suggestions from the pros:

* Offer your name – “It’s (NAME) ”
* Offer a friendly social greeting
* Offer a positive personal comment – “You look great in that ....” or “I love that color on you...”
* Bring a favorite “something” to show you are thinking about them – drink, food, flower, plant, object

Labeled photos, letters and music are nice to send, but don't be hurt if they are overlooked.  I noticed a lot of women enjoy holding a stuffed animal or a realistic baby doll when relaxing.  A nice piece of colorful clothing or something like a scarf can also be a very nice gift, and help refresh her daily wardrobe a bit.   Bless you for making the effort to stay in touch.  That alone is the most important thing you could do.",2021-05-03 16:41:48,TypicalSet0,n46r3w
Alzheimers,How to Support Parents When Grandparents Have Alzheimer’s?,"Adults who have parents with Alzheimer’s- what things did your kids do (or you wish they had done) to help you through everything?

My grandma has Alzheimer’s, around Stage 6, and lives in a memory care facility a few states away from my dad (but in the same town as his brothers, so she has family close by to visit her). I’m in college so I don’t spend much time with my dad, but I know this whole thing is really hard on him and want to help him as much as I can. He’s a proud guy and a really good dad so he never really talks to my siblings and I about how this is affecting him and has told us not to worry about him, but obviously we still do. He and my mom are divorced, his dad died over a decade ago, and my siblings all moved out of our hometown for college, and I just don’t want him to go through this alone. He’s not the type of person to answer honestly if I just outright ask him how he’s doing and won’t respond well to being pushed to talk about his emotions, but I want him to know that he’s got support if he needs it. 

If anyone who’s been in mine or my dad’s spot has things that helped in this situation that would be awesome! Or if you have things you wished you had done or things your kids could have done that would’ve been a big help.","I’m the grandchild in this situation, but I’d be happy to chat with you and answer any questions I can. Send me a DM any time!
Honestly I have the best children!  They helped me so much, by just spending time with me and my mom as much as they could.  They would take weekends from school and breaks to visit while I lived with my mom to care for her.  That meant so much! 

They also called and checked in every day, sent pictures and told me what was going on in their lives so I could feel connected to them and supported.  They told stories about my mom and things I had told them over the years.  They put together picture books for me and my mom. 
So, it was not so much what they said, but all the things they did.  

Finally, they did see me breakdown a couple of times despite trying to remain “strong” for them.  They just hugged me and told me they loved me.  I had lost my dad when I was young so my mom was everything to me.  I went though all stages of grief (perhaps anger was my longest).  But my children raged and cried with me.  And gave me space not to talk when I couldn’t.  

You are doing all you can to show your father your love and support in the same ways.  Check in on him everyday, take time to visit him and your grandmother, put picture books and stories together for both of them, talk to them both and make them laugh.  You are so incredible already to ask how you can help him!  I bet he is so proud of you and feels he has the best children too!
My daughter is my biggest sounding board. If I'm frustrated, sad, angry, or anywhere in between, she'll sit and listen. If she's off work earlier (she still lives at home), she'll cook or help cook dinner or do the laundry. My son and his wife have frequently offered to bring dinner, cook a meal for me, etc. It's very helpful.
My dad has Alzheimer’s and I’m 33 and he’s 66. My mom is 63 and still works full time. My brothers and I take turns being home because we have been working  from home since last year. Since that’s not possible for you, I would say the biggest thing to help would probably be ...call your dad more often, just to talk. Talk about anything and everything...things he likes, sports, weather, how school is going. Maybe plan a couple times a week where you can even have a quick chat and once where you can talk a little longer. I talk to my mom as much as possible, A) because I just like talking to my mom and B) because she can’t have conversations with my dad anymore because he’s not able to communicate at all so she just feels lonely at home.",2021-05-03 17:25:02,TypicalSet0,n47sn4
Alzheimers,My grandmother has advanced Alzheimer’s,"My grandmother has lived with my mom (and sometimes me) since 2013. She’s gotten steadily worse over the years to the point where her short term memory now lasts about 20-30 seconds. She can’t remember when she’s eaten so she eats constantly if someone doesn’t stop her. She’ll say she goes on walks but her feet are so swollen since actually getting her to leave the house to go anywhere requires at least half an hour of persuasion and fighting. Her personality is all but gone, and all that’s left of the old her is her ego. Sometimes I look at her and think “Who is this old hag and what has she done with my grandmother?” And then I feel guilty because I know she can’t help it and can’t control it. She used to be a very independent person but now she’s constantly asking what she can do and we tell her that we’ve got it handled because she just gets in the way if she tries to help. Even simple tasks must be explained to her very simply and repeatedly, and even then she gets it wrong half the time. It’s especially hard on my mom. My grandmother wasn’t always the greatest mother to my mom and now she relies on my mom for everything. She can’t make food for herself and she does no self hygiene unless forced and assisted. She’d wear the same robe, nightgown, and pair of underwear all the time if we let her. She’s turned into a child and it’s heartbreaking to see my once strong, smart, interesting, enigmatic, and independent grandmother be reduced to this. She’s travelled all over the world, met all sorts of interesting people, and done all sorts of amazing things and now she doesn’t remember any of it. She used to have these amazing stories about her life, but then they got wilder and less accurate as she gradually forgot them one by one. Now the only story she really remembers is about how the Nazi’s invaded Denmark and how her family helped Jews escape to Sweden. She’ll make up stories, trying to relate to anything someone tells her. 99% of those stories is bullshit but I know she doesn’t know that. She’s always been the kind of person who took control of a conversation, but now she stills tries but has nothing to say. Her English is also slowly slipping. She’s forgetting names of things, even things she used to love. Her favourite flowers are daffodils and tulips, but she doesn’t remember the names of either of them most of the time. I miss who she used to be. I know if pre-Alzheimer’s her met her now, she’d have absolutely no time for current her. She’d also be horrified at what’s happened to her. I also know if she still had her wits about her, there’s no way in hell she’d still be living with us. She’d probably be off travelling or spending time with her mom or sister. I feel like I love her less than I used to and I hate it but she stresses me and my moms out so much I don’t know what to do. She’s on the wait list for a care home but they probably won’t have a spot for her for two years. My mother and I have started counting how many times she brings up the Nazis or Trump (she hates him) because that’s the only way we can cope with hearing it over and over and over and over and over and over again. We know it’s always the first time for her but it’s hard to not let the frustration show after she’s asked about something for what feels like the millionth time. I really applaud and highly respect everyone who does elder care for a living. Living with my grandmothers has taught me that I don’t have that kind of patience. Maybe it’s easier if you’re not related to them; if you didn’t know them before. She doesn’t know she had Alzheimer’s and there’s no point in telling her because it’ll just upset her and she’ll forget again in a couple minutes but be in a bad mood all day. She’s very healthy physically, which is almost worse in a way because it means she’ll most likely die from this disease. My family is typically long lived, so she’ll keep getting worse for years. We’re doing all we can to slow the progression of the disease as much as possible, but we know there’s only so much we can do. I do feel very lucky that she’s gotten sweeter as her memory has gotten worse. Her father killed himself and we suspect he was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer’s, along with other issues, and that’s one of the reasons he did what he did. We do our best to keep her comfy and happy, but it wears us out. I’ve seen my mother cry from the stress of it all and that breaks my heart too. My step-grandmother is also living with us for the time being (she doesn’t have Alzheimer’s) and luckily she gets along great with my grandmother. But her being here does mean that my grandmother is awake and in the living room more often which means she asks more questions, reads the headlines from the paper repeatedly, and asks the same questions repeatedly too. I do my best to be supportive and answer her million questions. There are good parts, like how I can tell her personal things and get them off my chest without worrying about her telling anyone and she is happy to listen to my rants. I don’t really have an end to this particular rant; I just had to get it off my chest. None of my friends have family with Alzheimer’s so I wanted to post this here, where I’m sure other people are going through something similar.","I’m sorry. This is so hard. If you can read Tam Cummings book, Untangling Alzheimer’s. It will explain what is going on and offers a good bit of help. For me, I have more patience with my mom’s behavior when I see what it causing it. It will never be easy though. This disease is horrible for the patient and caregiver alike.

Alzheimers,Moving with Grandpa,"My grandma died back in December and my grandpa has gone downhill fast. My grandma made us promise to live with him, which we would've done anyway. He keeps saying he doesn't want to move. We got approved for a loan and got his house appraised and he had no problem with that, but when we talk about finding houses he gets stubborn. Its worse on his bad days, but still. How do we convince him to move? He forgets we're looking at houses and when we tell him he is surprised and upset because he doesnt remember.


He's still there enough that he refused to give mom power of attorney, but she does have medical power of attorney over him. We want to talk to his doctor, but the problem is he doesnt remember he has Alzheimer's(oh the irony) so when I ask for his paperwork for his doctor he brings me the stuff for his k 
Nee replacement which is in a completely different network. 


On the upside, we've removed three tons of recycling from his house. My grandma was a 'clean' hoarder, but kept every magazine, paper, etc. Would print out emails and keep them. Her office looked like a maze. He went through the stuff we deemed recycling. At first I was annoyed, but it kept him busy and out of the way and he didnt end up pulling anything back out. We also got the basement gone through(looked like the warehouse scene in Indiana Jones) and have taken probably a Uhaul amount to goodwill.",Your and Grandpa's life will be much easier if you can figure out how not to move him.

Alzheimers,Dealing with Alzheimer's as a relative,"As I am laying in bed crying I just needed to find a group to talk about this. My mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and everytime I get back to my place after visiting my parents I'm just so depressed. I know it's hard for my mom and of course for my dad. But it's hard for me as well. I see my mother unable to perform very easy task or being unsure of how to eat an egg and I get so angry. Because for me, sometimes there are two people. The mom I used to have and this new one. And my mom used to be so skilled and she could remember so much and manage our family. And I know that I shouldn't get angry at her. It's not her fault. But it's like - i want my old mom back. And then I'm angry at me for hating this new mom who isn't what I need and want. Like - what kind of monster am I? 
Is there anyone else out here dealing with Alzheimer's in a relative and having a hard time handling it? What might help?",">  And I know that I shouldn't get angry at her. It's not her fault. But  it's like - i want my old mom back. And then I'm angry at me for hating  this new mom who isn't what I need and want. Like - what kind of monster  am I? 

You are doing pre-grieving, which is common for caregivers and family of people suffering through long, terminal illnesses.  Anger is a normal stage in the grieving process, and you (as I did and do) come back to it, over and over and over, until you work through it and everything else you need to work through.  

Do not be surprised if, after she passes, you are done with grieving really quickly.  You're doing all that hard work now.  It's not something that you need to ""fix"", you're not a monster, you're human doing the normal human thing when faced with this horror.  So be gentle with yourself as you would with anyone who's grieving: it's necessary work, let yourself work through it.
One of things you can do is what you are currently doing: grieving. You are dealing the loss of the mother you knew, and now learning about this new version of her. It's important to walk yourself through this stage and see it at every angle, good and bad. You are not a monster for having these feelings, and it is a healthy and normal response to a terrible disease. But the sooner you can move past this grieving period, the faster you can help her along with this journey.  As you said, it's not just hard for her but you and your family so it is a shared experience.  


Many people will suggest support groups, which are great and can be really beneficial to understanding more about the disease, what to possibly expect, and just being able to relate to others going through the same thing. The reality is, not everyone knows about dementia, let alone something like Alzheimer's. So you may find yourself communicating with people who just simply cannot comprehend what you, your family, and your mother is going through. Make sure you talk with your dad and other family members too, because their insight might help you in ways you never thought about. And seeing a therapist may also help to work out some of your feelings and doubts. It is important that your (mental)health is taken care of so that you are able to advocate and care for her in whatever capacity.  


Another thing is, you will likely experience ups and downs—peaks and valleys—and sometimes revert to feelings of anger. That's okay, and no one should tell you differently. But give yourself a break and check in with yourself. Never let your anger manifest itself towards your mother, because that is unfortunately an easy and common occurrence. You already have a great attitude by recognizing that it's not her fault, and you are reaching out to people here, and that's the kind of mentality to carry forward; not everyone does that, and some family members can be very unforgiving or harsh.  


Also, if you haven't already, educate yourself about the disease as best you can. Studies, articles, journals, testimonials, etc, are all great resources to help better overcome the challenges your mother and family will face. Familiarizing yourself with the 7 stages of Alzheimer's is a good start, but remember that these are general stages and not everyone will experience all of them and/or go through the actual order. Knowing what to expect, anticipating new and different care plans, and accepting that some things will get worse will only help you in the long run.  


Just know that the love for your mother will give you the strength to ensure her quality of life is what it should be. It will not be easy but the efforts you put forth now will make her experience the best it can be. I know I am just a stranger on the internet, but remember that there are others who care and have gone through what you have. You are not alone.
It is very frustrating, but there is a sweetness that enters into your relationship w/ your mom as you get to know her new self & help her as she helped you your entire life. 

Treasure the moments- laugh & cry. Reminisce. Keep her healthy w/ exercise & fun Senior activities- chair yoga, senior classes, museums etc. Remember the times you have w/ her now, even if/when she doesn’t.
It is hard. I bet you've local groups near you if you want face to face, check hospitals and even churches often have them. It's good for shared resources and just being able to break down with people who understand. 

Facebook has groups too, both private and public. 

A great resource is APlaceForMom and the Alzheimer's Society. 

For reading material The 36 Hour Day is sometimes painful but has great information.
Sorry you’re dealing with this. My advice is, take care of yourself- get therapy if you need it, get selfish with making yourself happy- you’ve got tough days ahead, and everyone around you will benefit from having the happiest version of you that you can manage.
This is quite a normal feeling for this scenario. I’m sorry - it really sucks. You’re not a monster for feeling the way you’re feeling. My mom is still alive but I feel as though I grieved her years ago.

I highly recommend therapy if you’re able to get it. I sort of bottled all my feelings up and one day I just snapped. I was a blubbering mess at work and found a therapist that day. It was incredibly helpful to talk about my feelings and thoughts with a professional.
What you feel is normal. Your situation is so similar to mine, I really feel what you are going through. It might be a far fetched suggestion, but what is helping me in being non-judgmental toward the emotions that arise, to observe them with equanimity, and generally dealing in the situation with loving detachment (at least some times) has been practicing mindfulness and advaita vedanta meditation. If you're curious, you will find many resources online.
My mom is obviously going through it but she is resistant & extremely paranoid/fearful of going to the neurologist for the diagnosis. 

It’s been two years now since we spotted obvious symptoms ie she couldn’t board a plane successfully x 4.  She has always had some mental health problems and serious issues around depression, problem solving, and productivity. But now it’s just so so so so hard. The short term memory is such a challenge and she’s just so off. She gets overwhelmed easily and can hardly talk for any length of time without really following the convo. 

She recently passed out and they are considering a pacemaker (not fully sure that she needs one yet per cardiology) but I feel like a horrible daughter because I don’t want that for her. Her mind may be gone but her body is strong and will go forever with a pacemaker. Her mother went on for like 15 years after she was completely gone. It’s just icky. I mean obviously if it’s clear it’s what is needed I’m sure we will — BUT man... her quality of life is so low already... 

I struggle daily with - am I doing enough ? (I’m her only child, I envy families with multiple children to help shoulder the burden); with how frustrated and crazy she can make me! Give me more patience! Serious grief watching how sad and upsetting her life is quickly becoming. Watching my father lose his life partner. She is quite mean to him about it all, which adds to the pain/ dysfunction. 

I hate it, I understand the guilt
I'm so sorry you're going through this too. My mum has recently been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's at just 63, and every time I see her I'm ok until I come home, when it all just feels so depressing and I have a good cry. I'm so sad for her, she's had a tough life at times and had recently responded well to treatment for her chronic leukemia, as well as finally being in a better financial position with my dad after years of struggle. It's unfair, and she's scared as she watched her mum die from this horrible disease at a younger age too. I'm in my final year of uni as a mature student and have so much work to get through, but equally I'm desperate to be with her before she slips away into a different her.. it's all happening so quickly. 

I guess one thing that it has made me want to do is volunteer. I feel like if I can't have my own darling mum to  look after into old age, maybe I can help other old people who are still here and need help. 

Talking. If you've got support, use it. Just typing this is therapy in a way. You're addressing it, you're dealing with it, and you deserve life and happiness too so make time for yourself.

Sounds silly but I record my mum and I chatting. I know one day I'll want to hear that back. 

Look after yourself x
Sweetie, it takes time for you to accept your new mother. At her core, she's still the same person you knew, she just needs a lot of help and support now. It's ok to cry.",2021-05-02 17:52:24,Kaabi88,n3gwur
Alzheimers,What's available for toilet problems?,"Jesus christ, mum decided to shit on the hallway carpet instead of the toilet. Then refused to accept it was her, suggesting it was one of the many people who pass through the house (there are not people passing through the house) . After accepting I was not going to be able to get her to clean up her mess I've been down with plastic bags, a sponge and some dettol. Figured a face mask might help with the smell. I'm not good with poo, there was heaving, and then a mask full of vomit. Genuinely wish I didn't exist.

We've had a few issues with pee which I can deal with, poo is a new low which is beyond me. Any suggestions for things to help please?","We use depends for my family member with Alzheimer’s. Adult diapers (the extra absorbent kind) are great for longer amounts of time where you can’t change them as often, then the normal ones are good for overnight for comfort. Amazon has a bunch we use actual depends brand. Also get some diaper bags to throw them away when you change them. We also use disposable bed pads when he sleeps so it doesn’t get through to the mattress in case he has an accident overnight and the diaper can’t handle it.
I'm sorry you're dealing with this! My grampa had the same issue and would defecate in the bedroom during the night and also pee all over the house. Please be nice to her though, she does not understand what she's doing, so blaming her and trying to shame her won't help. And having her clean it up herself is also not the way to go, in my opinion.

Alzheimers,Father-In-Law in a Memory Care Facility - they say they can't handle him anymore,"After arguing with my MIL for a year that she can't take care of him by herself, she finally agreed to put my FIL in a memory care facility. He is only 66, but has very severe early-onset Alzheimer's that basically took him from 100% to a shell of a human in about 18 months. 

We checked him into the facility in January, and now 4 months later they just called and said they can't handle him there. He is aggressive towards other patients and staff, and recently just attacked a nurse and broke her wrist. They said we need to find him a private caregiver to stay in the room in the facility with him for 12+ hours a day. We absolutely cannot afford this (we saw rates close to $20,000/month). They said if we don't have a caregiver for him within the next month then they are kicking him out. 

We are looking into what kind of financial aid or medicare coverage we can find. 

What other options do we have? This sounds like a medication issue to me - can't they sedate him? The guy has no idea what planet he is on and can't identify even his closest family members. He is confused and scared all the time. What other options do we have if a memory care specialty facility can't even help him?","This may seem like an odd suggestion but consider getting him a hospice evaluation.  There is no copay if he has Medicare and It means that the memory care will have access to hospice nurses and physicians 24 hours a day.  This means when he is agitated, the memory care can call and a hospice nurse will come and take care of him. Hospice will treat his symptoms and get him straightened out, medication-wise.

The trade off is that he won't be sent to the hospital if there is a problem, hospice will handle everything.  The good thing is that he won't be giving up any treatment, the care for Alzheimer's disease is pretty much the same with or without hospice.   He would have access to lots more direct care by people who know what they are doing.
They may be using the wrong medicine.  Ativan and Haldol just made my husband more agitated and aggressive.  Evidently these paradoxical effects are not uncommon in the elderly.  Zyprexa calmed him down in hospital and Risperidol has worked wonderfully at home.  We are on hospice.  Maybe bring in a gerontologist to assess his medications?
I think it's important to always talk to professionals about your options, specifically organizations like the Alzheimer's Association and health-care workers who deal with this stuff daily. I am assuming you have, but exhaust all those possibilities first. While you can find good information here, sometimes you run into misinformation or information that doesn't really apply to your specific situation. I know people have good intentions in this sub, but I've read some comments that I don't think are always helpful or accurate.

As a caregiver for several years in both home and facilities, and now having worked exclusively with Alzheimer's clients(and those with extreme aggression) for the past four years, what your FIL is experiencing isn't unique or uncommon; I say this as a positive, because it means that his situation happens frequently enough for there to be options and possible solutions. So know that your FIL's situation isn't hopeless, and that if anyone has told you differently they are being disingenuous. And while my experiences may be considered anecdotal, I take this very seriously and always advocate for the person in need.

I think the goal would/should be to keep him in the facility, as that is his new home, which means finding realistic options that works towards this. Unfortunately this can be very challenging because many if not most facilities are not equipped to handle a resident with aggression, especially if the aggression has resulted in injury. The common misunderstanding or assumption is that these facilities are well-staffed who are also well-trained. That is simply not the case in my experience. What is typical is that these facilities often hire people with little to zero experience in care-giving, let alone experience with dementia. Even if they are trained, they don't usually have the stamina and/or empathy to stay around long enough. That means you have a revolving door of inexperienced, exhausted caregivers who don't want to deal with aggressive residents. So many facilities are incentivized and eager to kick out a resident like your FIL in order to keep both staff and other residents happy. It is a business after all, and they will have no problem finding another resident to fill up the room.

The first thing is addressing the option of hiring additional help. You stated: ""They said we need to find him a private caregiver to stay in the room in the facility with him for 12+ hours a day. We absolutely cannot afford this (we saw rates close to $20,000/month)."" This number seems a bit high and I would suggest digging around a little more and contacting as many agencies in the area as possible. Obviously it varies by state but the typical agency here in California usually charges anywhere from $25 to $30 per hour for care-giving/companionship. If your FIL is currently in a facility, hiring a caregiver from an agency should be considered a companionship role since the facility is technically still providing the care. So you are more likely looking at around $10K per month, which is still expensive, if you went that route. Make sure if you are reaching out to these agencies that you explain the situation and specifically ask for a companion, as some places may offer cheaper options for less ""care.""

I don't think it's a bad idea to hire a companion in the interim. I would try this because it's possible for an outsider, assuming they are decently trained, to observe your FIL's situation and find out if there is anything that could be contributing to the aggression. It's very easy for people to default in their thinking that it is simply the result of the disease and nothing external. This might be the case for your FIL's situation, but I have seen many residents have sudden leaps in aggression for external reasons that the staff did not notice; for example, it could be the staff aren't recognizing certain triggers with your FIL. So everyday they may be doing something to anger him, and it could be something really simple or not that obvious. Sometimes it's simply the way they address him, tell him to do something, dress him, feed him, etc. I was helping a resident in a facility who was only aggressive when it came time for toileting, and I was able to toilet with no issues whatsoever. I then asked to watch the staff do the toileting, and saw mistake after mistake. So having an additional set of eyes could help in determining if this is the case or not. It certainly won't hurt the situation and may provide some insight.

As someone else has pointed out, trying to get him to also qualify for hospice could be a possible solution; if your FIL qualified for Medicare/Medicaid, then you could be looking at little to no pay. But there are also state-specific non-Medicaid programs, so make sure you've looked over those in your state; as mentioned before, you can reach out to an Alzheimer's organization for additional information/help. If he happens to be a veteran, then he definitely has benefits/aid from the government.

But something really important to consider here if you go the hospice route will be the change in medications, which is something that has been communicated in the comments. It's not uncommon for a hospice nurse, along with a doctor, to suggest a change or the inclusion of additional medication to reduce the aggression.

There is a very slippery slope when it comes to medication changes, and it must be addressed and handled very delicately. I've watch countless clients/residents have their medication change over and over, with hospice nurses, doctors, family members, and staff all desperate to resolve the aggression. And the vast majority of the time the client/resident became a zombie, sleeping all day and having less or zero quality of life. You do not want to sedate the person as a means of combating the aggression, but it happens too frequently and is seen as the ""only solution"" to keep them in a facility. Please avoid this route if possible.

While there are more effective medications for aggressive Alzheimer's patients, as some having pointed out in the comments, please consult the experts. For example, Haldol is one to avoid since there is now enough studies/data on it being ineffective and/or deadly. But it is still recommended and talked about. Remember, there is technically no ""Alzheimer's"" medication but rather antipsychotics that help with their symptoms. So you are essentially experimenting with neuroleptics in hopes that they reduce the symptoms in some way. Unfortunately that means you have to test multiple medications, then wait weeks to see if they are effective. And then repeat the whole process again if it doesn't work. That is a lot for the person to go through, and a lot of time the facility may not want to offer.

There are a few other options that are either going to be very expensive—e.g. moving him in to a small home that only deals with aggressive patients—or having him committed to some kind of psychiatric hospital.

If you have any questions or need clarification, please let me know. I may not have all the answers, but I will try my best to provide guidance.
This is me exactly two months ago. Most memory care facilities are ill-equipped for rage and aggression, which is ridiculous since they're supposed to be the experts. You need one that also has 24/7 skilled nursing and on-site doctors.

The first place my mom was at was private pay, and she was almost out of money. We were advised to get the first possible placement in a Medicaid facility, so we did that and thankfully it was the facility that all of our friends and associates rave over. What a joke that turned out to be.

She ended up doing exactly what you dad did. A nurse grabbed her and said ""no!."" My mom flipped out, started punching, and fractured the nurse's wrist supposedly. They dropped my mom off at the ER without a change of clothes or medications. I got the call, after the fact, from the psych ward's social worker. I called the nurse at the facility and was told, ""Oh, we were getting around to calling you."" Because they dropped her off without pre-approval from her doctors, Medicare wouldn't cover the bill. The doctors and social workers told me that we would not be safe with her in our home. She's lashed out at me many times. The hospital stay was a month at $2,200 a day, but the hospital extended her a discount due to her income. It's still close to $20,000 for her month's stay.

This is what happened. The month in the geriatric psychiatric floor found that if you don't grab her or say no, she's calmer. They switched her to injections of Haldol, but that requires skilled nursing care. She's a wander risk and has to be in a secure wing. It took the month of the social workers doing their part, as my state doesn't have Alzheimer's communities with 24-hour skilled nursing, but they found her a place in a neighboring state that has a secure wing, on-site psychiatric and geriatric doctors, and 24/7 skilled nurses for the Haldol injections.

You have to push for sedatives. I was asked flat out if I was okay with them keeping my mom in a sedate state 24/7. She's wanted to kill herself to end this stinking disease for so many years, that she's already miserable. At least she's out-of-it now.

When your dad is to his last $2,000 in savings (differs for a couple, so you'd have to find out with  your state), Medicaid will cover his stay. Look for a facility that has Medicaid specialists on the staff. It's much more helpful to have an expert already there and not someone on the phone with the state who may bounce you around from one person to the next. What happens with Medicaid (I'm in Vermont), is they take all of my mom's pension and Social Security and leave her with $75ish in spending money per month. They do cover the rest though.
They should have a doctor on staff that can treat dementia/Alzheimer’s related aggression with medications like zyprexa or seroquel. It’s weird that they’re kicking him out because I’m my experience as a nurse, I’ve found that very few patients need to be sent out due to aggression. It also really depends on the kind of workers that are working at the facility. Some memory care facilities are wonderful but some aren’t. Do you know if the caregivers at your facility are certified or how many nurses are present at all times? I just find it really odd that they’re having issues like this after four months.
In my experience, when dementia patients become too difficult to handle they are sent out to acute geriatric psych facilities for medication management. Those facilities have locked units, psychiatrists on staff and 24-hr skilled nurses. They review meds and change current regimen as necessary. Once the patient’s behavior becomes more manageable, they return to their home facility with new med orders to be carried out by the staff.
Challenge them. What have they done to prevent this behaviour? Have they figured out what triggers his aggression? Have they mapped his 6 basic needs(kitwood model)?

Staff can be quick to state 'they don't belong here'. There is no place for them to go, so they do, in fact, belong here. Medication can help, but more often it's in the approach, the over/understimulation, the lack of a home- feeling etc.
There are other places that will work with you to adjust medications. I wouldn’t let them pressure you. I don’t think they can legally kick you out if you haven’t found a new place yet. Take your time and find a place that’s going to work for the long term.
This has been going on for a long time. The we can’t handle them anymore thing. The want to shed responsibility for the charge. I work at a jail and I don’t know how many times the police have brought us an individual from a psychological institution that the staff says they can’t handle. Everybody in the jail is like “what the fuck? This is why they exist.!” These poor people they bring us don’t know right from wrong or up from down and are now coming off their meds because we have to use our own doctors to get meds ordered. The officers there maybe have a couple hours of mental health training a year, if you think that’s not enough we also have countless days of all other types of training that relate to our job. These unfortunate souls do not need to be in jail. The fact that these care facilities that are built for this can’t handle them is just a way of saying I don’t really want this burden anymore. We have also taken dementia/Alzheimer’s patients from nursing homes that have gotten violent. They don’t even know their fucking names or where they are. So, just to let you know, I have zero faith in nursing homes or psychological institutions to properly care for dementia or Alzheimer’s patients, they just might send your loved ones to jail.
My mother has been similarly aggressive in her current memory care unit and I was getting calls that led me to believe they’d soon kick her out. I hired a patient advocate and it helped immensely. I highly
Recommend doing so if you can afford it. She met with the staff (found out nothing was being documented and there wasn’t a clear care plan in place) and arranged for a psych evaluation. My mom is now in the process of changing meds and I see a difference. We are still moving her as we’ve discovered the staff isn’t equipped or trained properly in dementia care, but all of it will hopefully make her move successful. The Alzheimer’s association website has patient advocate recommendations that you can search for by zip code.
Has he been checked for a UTI?  My mother goes absolutely nuts when she has one.  Had to be carried out of a facility by police officers and sedated to get her under control.
A resident just broke my mother’s door in an aggressive rage and was sent to psych in a hospital for it. If they can get his meds adjusted, he’ll be back. If not, he’s need to go to skilled nursing, not assisted, unless family can provide someone to watch them during the day.  I think that’s the usual protocol as assisted us only to help an hour or two a day, not all day, and the other residents would need protecting.",2021-05-02 10:39:37,David_Cain,n37obj
Alzheimers,My father's morning routing,"This is how it goes for him.

He wakes up early, at around 6:45 AM, gets his day clothes on (he sleeps in his shirt anyway). He says goodbye to the woman that lives in that house and cleans it, telling her he has to return to his own house. My mother sighs and wishes his a good day.

He gets into the elevator (the apartment is at the third floor of  a condominium), he gets down at the ground floor and without getting out of the building he calls my mother on the phone. He asks ""are you home yet?"", she patientily replies ""yes, I'm here, please come"".

He gets into the elevator again, goes up, opens the apartment's door with his own keys (this is paramount), undresses and prepares his breakfast. Then he goes to bed again for about an hour, or until he gets confused with some thought and has to ask a question to my mom.

This happens every single day. On the bad days he get extremely angry at the people occupying the house *he bought* before getting out of it. My mother and older brother can't do anything but indulge him and letting him go, hopying he won't get out of the building or too far anyway. This comedy sounds funny, but it's indeed exhausting for everyone.","It does sound exhausting and not funny to me either, I am going through similar situations with my dad. The last few weeks he's taken to getting up before dawn and walking around the house arguing with imaginary people. This morning he thought they were stealing his clothes. 

Usually if I tell him no one's here he will calm down, but that only lasts about 20 or 30 minutes and then we cycle back again.

He is being moved into memory care on Tuesday morning. I do not feel bad to admit that I am literally counting the hours until I can get a break. 

It might be time for your mom to consider the same for your dad. What if he somehow managed to get out of the building? 

There comes a point where those of us simply cannot give their loved one the kind of medical help they need. This is a disease and needs medical treatment from professionals. Good luck to you and your family.
I know it is hard but try to focus on the humor. This is an awful disease and we have to take the joy where we can get it. Without appreciating the humor, I’d go bonkers. I might be there anyway.
It must be heartbreaking for your mom.",2021-05-01 06:27:36,Aines,n2foy6
Alzheimers,My Moms MRI and Cognitive Issues. (I've posted on here before),"My mom is 60 year old female she had an MRI done on her brain this past Monday for on going cognitive issues for the last 5 years. I am not looking for an Alzheimers diagnosis but more of understanding of her MRI and I like this subreddit. I posted on here 2 years ago about her issues and will reference those posts at the end just so you all have a back story. Since I posted her Memory has def gotten worse but she hasn't forgot who anyone is or where she's at and still is able to drive like down the road to the store and sometimes 10 mins away if I got a doctor appt. I'm always with her when she does drive. Her short term memory is shot. She was long term user opioids for pain and even used a fentanyl patch for 11+ years. She is no longer on them after accidental overdose 5 years ago. We don't know if the opioids use is the cause of the issues or what. Last year when she had the MRI done it was normal. She's been getting them done each year and she does see a neurologist but she can't get into her doctor until June. In an MRI from a few years ago it showed ischemic changes but then like I said last year it said her MRI was normal. This was the MRI she had done on this past Monday and I was wondering if someone could help explain this because my sister and I are beside ourselves with worry. In the MRI it said that she has mild cerebral volume loss, multiple scattered FOCI of T2 prolongation seen of white matter that suggests chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The impression they got from the MRI is that there is cerebral volume loss with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. We just don't understand what any of this means. She will be seeing her neurologist again in June that she has been following up with. My sister and I are so worried though. She's the only living parent we have   
left. :/

Mild cerebral volume loss is a early sign of Alzheimers and chronic small vessel ischemic disease is an early sign of Vascular Dementia, and the opioid issues can have long term affects on people years after use has stopped.

Alzheimers,"Anxiety medicine, has it helped anyone?","My mom (70) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about 2 years ago. She’s always had horrible anxiety from a life’s worth of trauma. But after her twin sister died she couldn’t recover and I guess that’s when her Alzheimer’s started. 

I realized right away that when my mom gets anxious and overwhelmed she can’t really keep up with conversations or even remember something from a minute ago. Her native language is Spanish so I can actually communicate with her perfectly when she speaks Spanish. It’s like the Alzheimer’s takes a break and she speaks normally, but her English is just fading so fast. 

The doctor put her on a low dose of Zoloft to help with the anxiety, but it hasn’t done much, 7months later. She also turns to alcohol for her anxiety. I explained to my dad to tell my mom’s doctor about how bad her anxiety is and how she gets very irritated and overwhelmed. Her misophonia is so bad (like noises such as a blender will cause her to go into a rage.) 

But her doctor refuses to put her on any medication for purely anxiety because “she can become addicted”... This enraged me because I have seen my poor mom suffer a lifetime of anxiety and at this age she deserves to breathe and be calm finally. 

Have any of you been given anxiety medicine for someone with Alzheimer’s? Is it not a good mix? 
Thank you! Any suggestions would be so appreciated.","My dad recently got the Alzheimer’s diagnosis, but have been using anti anxiety meds to treat his Parkinson’s Disease related anxiety (I know super lucky right???).

For us it has really helped. He was on 100 mg of Zoloft (Sertraline) but it caused him stomach issues so now we are in 15mg of Lexapro.

It’s not a silver bullet though, we also use 3-4 mg of Valium a day.

All of these things help us manage the symptoms but they never go away and any day can be a bad day. But the drugs make sure that everyday isn’t a bad day.
Sounds like a question that's more suited for a doctor/GP to answer. My mum is only 65 and has been dealing with it for a number of years now. She's got some medication that may have changed her behaviour (balance, concentration) for the worse recently. The doctor should be aware of and let you know the side effects, but they're something you have to be careful of.

Disclaimer: Not sure about specific anti-anxiety meds or their side effects
I would consider reaching out to a Geriatric Mental Health Doctor or a Neurologist who is well versed with the challenges Alzheimer's Disease poses. Using meds & non-chemical behavioural means to navigate the symptoms of the disease in the specific individual is a  balancing act & a health care professional who is familiar with the latest data & who can risk manage out potential negative side effects against present symptoms, is best suited to finding a regime that will help your Mom cope as best as she can. I'm sorry you're all having to walk this journey but please know you're not alone & we're here for you. Xo
You probably need to seek a second opinion from a geriatrician or a neurologist.  Yes, a low dose of an anti-anxiety medication can help.  Just guard against allowing doctors to put her on too many medications.  That usually creates more problems.
Great question- Try to avoid destabilizing benzos. We know now that They’re notorious for causing destabilizing femur falls. MIL was prescribed lorazepam benzo which caused her to lose her balance. She leaned up against her wheel chair in her room at night, it moved, she crumpled & broke her femur. No one called 911 for a week! Didn’t get morphine for a week either. CNAs just put her back in bed. WTH?! 

After only 7 weeks in memory care, she died 3 weeks later. MIL had been walking a mile a day w/ a smile w/ me & our dog for months before her kids put her in memory care. Horrific way to die!",2021-04-30 10:21:05,weedsoda,n1uvm8
Alzheimers,Hoarding or? Help,"My MIL has dementia and over her life has acquired several family members belonging - like, most of the things that they owned. Now that she has dementia fairly bad we have moved in with her. She can still move and talk but it varies day to day and she isn’t capable of taking care of her self in pretty much anyway (she attempts to handle the personal hygiene but we don’t wanna cross that bridge until we have to). That being said she has grown accustomed to al of these things in her houses that we now also live in (my husband I and our 9 month old). 

It’s overwhelming. Almost 3000sqft and basically no room is clutter free. Some rooms are only clutter and things that are completely unused. Others have been hacked at but still busy with things from several past family members. It’s equally as hard for my husband to let things go because he loved those people too (grand parents, his father and great aunt.) Obviously I respect their memories and don’t want to push anyone. But with her dementia all the clutter makes it so much worse and dangerous not just for her but for our baby. 

My husband really wants to find a way to keep as much stuff and keep it all at home but some of the larger bulkier items like couches and chairs that aren’t used take up needed space. And donating these items only cause rage. Obviously I get it. I’m not trying to be insensitive but when the clutter causes more pain the pleasure where do you draw the line and how do you intervene? My husband is willing to let a lot of things go and that helps but at the same time when do we start just throwing stuff out or is there a better way? She honestly won’t part with any of it. 

I need advice. I love her and she is the sweetest and I hate that I only met her at this time in her life because I love the things she loves but her safety is in danger and her life would be so much better if she had a proper clean and hygienic clutter free home.",Why not a storage unit?,2021-04-29 18:20:19,MemoryFriendly8577,n1fto0
Alzheimers,Alzheimer’s and blindness,"Hi. I am desperately looking for anyone who may have some insight on Alzheimer’s in people already completely blind. 

My dad (65) has been blind for the past 15 or so years. About 4 years ago he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and it has since progressed rapidly so that he no longer knows who any of us are on most days. I think this is made worse by the fact that he can’t see us. 

Until about 2 years ago he could still get around well enough but since then his mental map has deteriorated and he often gets confused about WHERE he is. 

So many of the suggestions for coping and helping have to do with visually seeing things. 

I even contacted several of the Alzheimer’s organizations directly to see if they had any resources for people dealing with multiple disabilities. They had nothing, said they would look into it. But after a few months of fruitless email exchanges I haven’t heard anything else. 

We finally admitted him to a home last month because my mother was caring for him alone and he required 24 he care. 

However, they don’t want him walking around since he can’t see where he is going/is confused about where he is going and I am horrified to think that this man who has been active his whole life and is still in fine physical health is being confined to a chair most of the day. 

Also my mom is basically a hoarder so I guarantee their home was far less safe for him to wander than his sparsely furnished nursing home room. 

Anyway...just looking to connect with someone who might have had similar experiences and has some suggestions or just a familiar struggle to share.

Edit to add: 

due to his Alzheimer’s he struggled to keep track of the cane he originally was using until it was just in effective and also sometimes forgets he is blind or why he can’t see. This is a different problem then my worry about his care at the home. Just another part of his struggle that I’d like to connect with someone else and compare stories on.","Do they restrain him?  Seems he could still be mobile with a walker!
I don't have any wise words, but this is heartbreaking. I can't imagine dealing with this disease with a parent who's blind. Hoping  you get some good feedback here.",2021-04-29 18:36:51,Moonreigh,n1g60j
Alzheimers,Helpless Daughter Needs Advice for Dad.,"Hey everyone, I'm hoping maybe someone could give me some advice on how to tackle this issue. My Dad's symptoms have been worsening for the past 3-4 years and now his safety is at risk.

Long Story: About 2 years ago, our house (Dad's childhood home) had caved in forcing us to move to a rental house and eventually moving to our now home. My mom told me he has been exhibited symptoms for a while but kept them away from our knowledge until moving.

 Even since we settled into our now home, he exhibits more sun-downing quiet often, forgets his wife and who she is to him, doesn't know locally where he is at (stayed in the same city just on the outskirts), has left home multiple times for unusual reasons, typically going the wrong way. Other instances have happened where it's very overwhelming.

 As a result, this has made us get a security system installed so we can be alerted which direction he goes. Today he decided to jump our gates (6ft tall) and go running, because of this, there was no alarm set off. It's been over 4 times where we have had to drive to look for him (thank god for GPS on phones). He ran opposite of traffic, in rocks along a busy road, with no water and didn't answer his phone, today was the worst incident

I had confronted him last Summer when it became too much for me to witness only to be told 'I will do better, I'll work on it'.

 My mom has been taking it the worst because she's losing her husband every day but doesn't seem willing to put him in a memory care unit  We had convinced him to go to a doctor only for him to get upset the day before and refused to go. He hasn't gotten violent. Not sure how to help in this situation. While a diagnosis is not necessary, it would be nice to finally get a solid answer on all this and medical advice on how to handle it or prevent it from worsening as fast (If that's possible). 


Any advice would be helpful.

-Helpless daughter","Not sure I can really give advice more than a life lesson. My dad was like your mom. NO moving to a memory care community or even independent living for him with on-site assisted living to help with my mom. He wouldn't hear of it. He hid a lot of her symptoms from us at the same time. We knew she had Alzheimer's, but he was helping her enough that we couldn't  tell how bad it had gotten.

Then he had a seizure one night and she couldn't even remember how to call 911. Thankfully, my nephew happened to be there. Doctors found nothing concerning and sent him home. A few days later, he had a stroke in the bathroom. Again, she had no idea how to call 911. 

During all the tests for a stroke, doctors found a large tumor in the back of his head.  He didn't survive. Suddenly, my mom was alone in the house, with no way to care for herself, and memory care communities here all have a waitlist. We were lucky to get that wait cut to a few months, but it was a few months of me getting up, driving my husband to work so that I could have the car, bringing my laptop to her house, trying to work from her home while also care for her, and then waiting for my brother to get out of work so that I could go pick up my husband, get dinner started, and try to catch up on all the work I couldn't do while she was jumping up every two seconds and running outside again to ""go home.""

It was exhausting. Having her in memory care made a big difference. She made friends, she had around-the-clock care for her wandering habit, and we had the help of experts who see all aspects of this disease and could prepare us for what is next. It still hasn't been easy as we had to move her when she ran out of money and then the place that took her dumped her off in the ER when they couldn't handle her aggression, but we've had social workers by our side during these times, which has been helpful.",2021-04-29 19:26:01,aspirationaltallgirl,n1h5o1
Alzheimers,I need some help with MIL,"My mother in law is in serious decline and my wife is just rolling with the punches. MIL has always been feisty but she has recently had the police called on her for trying to break in to the neighbor’s house, not out of confusion but to confront him about something that never happened. She cannot remember what was spoken about minutes ago and when she’s at our house she repeatedly tells me how much our kitchen reminds her of the one in the house she grew up in and that she can’t picture the one in the house she’s lived in for the last fifty years. I understand that Alzheimer’s is messing with her memory and the very long term memories are the ones she can recall BUT she has a weird twist where she can invent recent memories and hold them against someone. They are exclusively negative and she believes them with all her heart. The one I’m living is that I took her home Christmas morning and dumped her off at her house to spend the holiday alone. It never happened, she was with us the entire week and when she did end up going home, my wife took her. She is convinced my children who adore her and are incredibly patient with her have purposely made an effort to make her stays uncomfortable (always inventing stories about loud music or making her watch tv shows she doesn’t like) they are 10 and 12, they do exactly as they are told, especially by her. There have been many others and they seem to be coming up more and more often. 

My question is how can those “recent” memories hold so steadfastly and consistently but things that really happen are gone within minutes? Honestly, I need help understanding how this is happening and if it’s normal because I’m struggling to continue allowing into my house.","This is known as confabulation:

This is seen in dementia, but also in head injury and brain damage from alcohol.  It should be reported to doctors and other caregivers as a symptom, but not taken as a lapse in morality, as perplexing as it may be.
Delusions are pretty common. My mom was convinced that her neighbor invited her to the movies and then drove off without her. She also claims that that same neighbor pulled a gun on her in the front yard and told her to get inside and never go outside again. None of it happened. We had cameras installed at her doctors' recommendations to see what was going on and most days she never left the house, yet she was telling us all about how she went outside and was threatened.

Even now that she's out of her neighborhood and in memory care , she will tell everyone that a spikey-haired woman stole her dog and lives in a shack up on the hill. She tries to escape daily to go find the shack and steal her dog back. Her dog is with my brother, and you can bring the dog for a visit and she's still convinced her dog was stolen.
I am not sure scientifically how they happen but just thought I’d write that it seems common and is definitely something we experienced with my mom. She would come up with the most insane things that happened to her or randomly think i or my siblings had done something to her. The biggest one was that she went on a walk and found a dead man hanging from a tree with his tongue cut out. Of course that didn’t really happen but to her it was so real.
> Honestly, I need help understanding how this is happening

As their brains break down and become less and less functional, everything starts to misfire, and depending on which areas of the brain are affected, different things happen.  My mother started with having trouble finding the right word, then had difficulty doing her household bills, then understanding everyday situations.  After that came a period of paranoia and delusions, at which point we had to take over her financial and medical affairs and provide 24 hour supervision. This all happened within 3 years.
Your wife is doing the perfect thing by “rolling with the punches”. It is really all we can do. Our loved ones are incapable of change. That leaves the adapting to us, the caretakers. We can’t “reason” or talk them out of a fantasy. Even if we could, it wouldn’t last and causes more confusion. “Rolling with it” and finding humor where you can is the best we can do.",2021-04-30 02:21:05,Beelzabubba,n1nv4l

Alzheimers,How do I lie without actually lying?,"Hello everyone. I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while reading the stories and silently accepting the idea that I'm not as alone as I feel, but no I'm in need of some advice. 

I'm fairly new to the role of caretaker as I'm 26 caring for my 54 year old mother with early onset Alzheimers. I'm familiar with the disease after seeing it with my grandfather, but he had a stroke and wasn't able to communicate properly because of it. My mother on the other hand started out forgetting she had been diagnosed and forgetting anything was wrong. This was a problem when filing for SSDI and when trying to restrict her driving. Lately she has been consistently asking me if she still has Alzheimer's - I've never been one to lie to my mother, but every time I tell her the truth she gets very upset, tries hitting her head on things and even tries to run off like she did last night. 

Has anyone had a loved one like this and maybe have a recommendation for a better way to answer this question?","Delay tactics work well for me. ""Mom, I'm not sure. let's look up symptoms when I'm done X and see if there are any matches."" By the time you're done whatever you've made up, she'll likely have forgotten and moved on to something else.
Don't think of this as lying, it's called love lies and it's any reply to a question where the truth will upset the LO. So for her question 'I'm not sure mum, why don't we ask the doctor next time we speak to them'.
It's hard to come to terms with it but a lie is sometimes the best and kindest thing my mom used to ask if her parents were around and if I told her ""no momma they passed away a long time ago"" she would cry and grieve for them so I just got in the habit of telling her they weren't there right now
It is better to lie to Alzheimer’s patients. I know that can be hard as a care taker but it is easier for the patient.
Agree with all of this. When my dad remembers his diagnosis he gets very upset and wants to argue about it, so we’ll type up his thoughts and tell him we’ll share them with the doctor at his next appointment. We’ve also done the ‘google symptoms after I finish ___’ with success. Redirecting and deflecting as been the most helpful!
My dad keeps alternating between ""there's nothing wrong with my memory"" and ""I think my memory has gone a bit since I hit my head"". He hasn't hit his head. 

I just go along with whatever his thoughts are on the day - as someone else suggested, delay tactics work well - ""oh of course there's nothing wrong with your memory but the doctor still has to ask, it's only routine"", or humouring the head bump story. 

Trying to tell him the truth only upsets him and can lead to bad mood swings - for him, the truth is brand new every time. Humouring is much kinder and easier for everyone involved.
My grandmother is similar, she will ask if we worry about her memory, typically when something occurs that makes her realize she forgot something important. We always divert from the question and say that everyone forgets things sometimes or something like that.
The technique is to divert and elaborate on other topics when you are asked tough questions to lighten the mood and reduce stress. Be playful and funny.",2021-04-27 21:26:20,tPaige5991,n03q0d
Alzheimers,"How do you deal with the abuse? How do you deal with someone who's angry all the time, but then the confusion only makes them even angrier?","To be honest my dad is always been an asshole and an idiot. But now that he has early onset Alzheimer's it's only got worse. And my poor mother is getting the worst of it. He hasn't become physically violent yet. But damn you're close to it. Punched a hole in the wall a few months ago.

Starts fights over the most stupid things. Oftentimes you'll start a fight over nothing at all. As if he had an imaginary conversation in his head that he's confronting you about. Sometimes you'll have a big blow out and then a couple hours later forget it ever happened and wonder why everyone's nervous around him.

My mom's ready to just give up and leave him. But can't afford to get out on her own. Can't afford to put him into a care home. He's not far enough along to qualify for it anyway. And he's too abusive, any home would kick him out. Can't just divorce him and kick him out, he'll forget and keep showing up anyways.

Just generally feeling trapped. Sure, I can save up some money and get out of here. But I don't want to leave my mom behind to deal with this alone.","I’m so sorry. I’m dealing with a bit of this. Moms mid stages. Can’t be alone anymore. Massively depressed. Takes her fear and anger out on me. Thinks I’m lying. Stealing her stuff. Etc. and She’s been my best friend my whole life. It’s incredibly hard and massively depressing. I feel like she’s pulling me under the ocean when she’s with me (sister helps). And I feel awful saying that. I wish I had advice. I don’t Really. It just is what it is. I don’t wanna have regrets ans I know she’ll have to go to assisted living eventually. It’s the worst. I’m with you.
Wholepaycheck is right, see if you can get your dads doctor to prescribe meds.  Tell your dad they are for blood pressure or something.  You can also grind them up and put them in food if they don’t taste too awful.  This may seem like a long, desperate and lonely journey.  You are not alone.  So many people have been thru this any everyone’s story is different with a lot of sad similarities.  See if there is adult day care in your town.  Sure your dad might get kicked out (my aunt got kicked out for being a racist ahole), but if you get some relief it’s worth it.  Good luck.
Sorry you’re going through this, my heart goes out to you. There are some pharmaceutical interventions that can be taken to mediate the symptoms if he can’t be put in a care home as is or be calm enough to live with others. Sounds like he might become a danger soon. This is a last last LAST resort, but some people never want to go to the doctors or take meds, especially those who don’t realize they are sick. Ive had luck calling the cops and having them respond to a domestic violence issue. This will appear on their record, but will lead to results if the police can take the person to a ward and have them sedated. This seems extreme but you have to protect yourself and this means the person might realize through the experience that they need sedatives or antidepressants and start on a road to be prescribed them. I hope you and your family find a way.
So sorry, it's very sad, infuriating tragic stressful horrendous.   I feel for you!   We have a different scenario,  horrendous intermittent abuse from sister (horrid mental health issues) who lives with alzheimers mum (as I do, mum's carer), family violence is often complicated & difficult, to say the least.  We don't have other family within thousand kms, mum no siblings. I too feel trapped.  Trying to help my mum.  Either it's this state, or put mum in a home & sell her house.  Awful. 

Have you contacted your Alzheimers .org and/or Dementia .org?  They are professional experienced specialists, have seen it all, can hopefully help you find some potential solutions, and/or at least management tactics.  At the least, they have telephone help-lines, counselling, etc.     There must be solutions somehow, eventually, does your govt just leave lost-it oldies out on the streets?  Too sad!    

>He's not far enough along to qualify for it anyway

It's awful when you start wishing they *were* that far along, to qualify.   Try be kind to yourself, get some counselling / support / through domestic violence or some org, you need the support!  

So sorry.   I really feel you!    Best of luck!
It's pretty rare that assholish people get nicer with dementia.  I have no advice but just wanted to give you validation that this is a very tough place for you and your mom to be.
I'm so sorry to hear this. Pretty much the same story is happening to me. I second what other people is saying. You father needs to be followed by a doctor, a geriatrician, that can evaluate him. Not all the anti psychotics work for every case, the theraphy must be targeted. And yes, grinding the pills or dropping drops in the meals and drinks is a common practice. And generally indulge him, do not contradict him, redirect his attention...best luck to you.
I sympathize. My mom and I were close, so her anger and rage towards me hurts. I learned this though. The first time she screamed at me to go away and never come back, I talked to my brother about needing to step back. I know it's the disease, I know it's not really her, but I also know that emotionally I am at the end of the rope and couldn't take the verbal abuse. I backed off from seeing her twice a week to every other week at first and then once a month. 

Her doctors have tried different medications. They tried therapy sessions. Last summer, things worsened with her attacking someone. After she broke her wrist, her anger really got bad, but she also wouldn't keep a cast on. After pulling off three casts, her radiologist said it wasn't worth trying a fourth one. She was doing more damage pulling them off and the bones had healed enough at that point. She attacked two others and ended up in the psych ward.

Meds (she was on an anti-psychotic and antidepressant) didn't help my mom much until now, supposedly. COVID has made it impossible to see her. She's now on Haldol by injection and that is working better than anything else has, but it also requires 24/7 nursing that wasn't available for dementia in my state, so she had to be moved out of state. 

In this gap, I've turned to focusing on my own mental and physical health. I'm catching up on every screening I'd been putting off while focusing on her. In the process, we found that I have some health issues of my own, so it was a great move. Anemia is one of them, so I started prescription iron and find it makes a difference in my energy levels so far.
I also care for an assholish, demented mother. It has turned out that the typical meds to treat the aggressive, nasty behaviors, did the opposite or her. After a hospitalization where even Haldol didn’t touch her crazy, her neurologist did a DNA test that is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of medications. She is now on one med. it is an anticonvulsant, used for mood stabilization. It works better. Additionally my son came home when she was in a full blown rage. He gave her THC in the form of a gel candy. Within an hour she was giggling and dancing. I called her Neurologist and his comment was “thank goodness you found something that works”. I now give her a liquid form twice a day. Finding what works is a challenge. You also need to trust your observations. Doctors can’t spend the time with them that you do. Trust your gut.
One last thought, as it sounds like our situations are similar. My mother was/is a type 1 personality and even with severe dementia, believes she is capable and doesn’t need my help. The best way to inflame her is to try to help her OR do a project she use to be capable of. Everything is complicated by her aphasia. It all seems impossible. I now do what I need and want to do and ignore her nastiness. I do my best to remain calm. I am working to create an environment that soothes both of us. Lockdown has made it all more complicated since her daycare closed March 18, 2020. She won’t wear a mask as required to attend when they reopen next week......sigh.",2021-04-27 12:45:53,kappakingtut2,mzsqls
Alzheimers,Declaring someone incompetent,"So...my daughter spoke to my MIL’s doctor today, because it had seemed like no one else in the family besides my husband was willing to admit there’s a problem with my mother-in-law and do anything about it.  Turned out, he told my daughter that my husband’s sister took the same concerns to him A YEAR AGO. He suggested testing at MIL’s annual physical and she refused.  He said at this point, unless someone has her declared incompetent, there’s nothing he can do. I feel even worse for my husband now. He’s felt all alone in his concern for his mom, thinking no one else saw the problems or cared. His sister repeatedly tells him “it’s just old age.” Ugh. 

So now the question is what to do from this point. She’s really already at the point she shouldn’t be alone. But clearly no one wants to do anything more.","Declaring incompetence is complicated and was not recommended by my legal advisors.  Instead, they recommended using a comprehensive durable POA which would allow me the same authorities we needed to help my mom without the legal hassles and medical exams.  It worked perfectly for the duration of her disease.  Incompetence sounds like the perfect solution, but when you start to parse it down, it gets more complicated - I assume because it's involuntary.

Both my parents signed the POAs and were happy to have it in place and to turn over more and more responsibilities as they became less able.  It made it a lot easier at the end because I knew where everything was; and I was familiar with/to all the people I had to work with to settle their affairs.  I feel for you.  Good luck.
I've seen situations like this before.  Unfortunately, you have to wait until they fall and break a hip or some other thing ends up putting the in the hospital.  The hospital won't discharge them to living alone again, and they'll be discharged to a nursing home.  This way, the doctors and hospital are the bad guys, not you, your husband and your daughter.
I really feel for you. My family is in a similar situation. I have no advice for you but wanted you to know you aren’t alone.",2021-04-26 18:28:31,birthwarrior,mz9uhc

Alzheimers,New caregivers support group on Facebook,"New young caregivers support group

 I’m not sure if this is really allowed or helps anyone at all but my friend started this caregiver support group for anyone who is 35 and younger. It’s focused on dementia for grandparents but she will allow other young caregivers in the group. 

I do not have a Facebook but she sent me the name. 

Its called Taking Care of Grandma A Young Caregivers Support Group. She is med and finance POA for her grandma and does not have any family really who can help so shes in it alone making decision for her grandma with dementia.

If you are 35 and younger this group might be for you

Alzheimers,Questioning life plans - need advice,"Hello, all.  

My wife and I are each either side of 50 years old.  We have always planned to ""get out"" and go see the country (which neither of us has really done).  My mother was placed in a memory care facility about 2 years ago.  I care for her dog now and see her about every two weeks with the dog (since COVID restrictions lightened up a bit).  She's VERY high functioning.  I'm her only child and her POA/ Trustee, but she has a dozen friends and family who visit her frequently.

I'm struggling with a choice we're intending to make.  We intend to sell our home and buy a truck and RV and travel the country, in a new place every couple of weeks - perhaps for the next 3 years (ish).  I would still fly back approximately every 3 months (or for any emergencies) to spend a few days with her, but I wouldn't likely be able to bring her dog to see her (the dog is getting older, but she LOVES the dog).  

Knowing that she'll need me around more in the future as she declines, and knowing that we're not getting any younger ourselves, we feel like we need this adventure in our lives now or perhaps never. Professionally and financially, we're finally in a place where we can do this.  But then I feel bad that I'm not going to be able to visit as often and that she won't be able to see the dog as often.

I devote a lot of time to her as her POA and Trustee, and I feel good about how I'm managing her affairs, but I need someone to tell me that this is a terrible plan and I'm a terrible person or tell me that it's ok to take care of myself and do what I want to do with my life while I still can.  This is an internal battle that I'm truly struggling with and any advice or tips would be welcome.

Thanks in advance!","Go.  But use technology to keep in touch.  Here is just one possibility.  Hire a local, stable, mature individual to adopt the dog and visit your mother every couple of weeks with the dog.  During those visits, set up Skype, Facetime, Zoom or whatever you use.  You'll have plenty to tell your mother each time and she'll probably enjoy seeing pictures from your travels, as well as your own faces!  

You'll need to screen the person carefully and get references, unless it's someone you already know.  But this creative solution might keep mom and you and your spouse happy in old age.
You’re not a terrible person for living the life that’s best for you.
I completely understand your predicament but you are giving her your time right now which is the most important. Right now she knows you are visiting and can enjoy your company. Eventually that will change. 

Once you have hit the road, connect with the people who visit her regularly to ensure she is being cared for. This will give you peace of mind.

And just think of what she would want you to do. It's so difficult moving on when you want to put your parent first.",2021-04-23 10:50:08,turtledave,mwwz3o
Alzheimers,My partner wants his mother who has Alzheimer's to babysit our baby,"My mother in law was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about a year and a half ago. She currently lives with my SIL who is her carer. Her illness is progressing slowly (at least in my opinion). She can still play golf,  use her iPad almost independently, make breakfast, do some household chores. However, she tends to forget what was said 20 minutes ago in a conversation etc, ask the same question again and again, gets confused in unfamiliar settings.

I'm pregnant, with our baby coming in a few months. When discussing who could help me with the baby when I need a break and some time off, my husband doesn't want to consider an occasional nanny because his mother can babysit. He claims she is good with babies, had three of her own and used to help with her other grandchildren. I don't doubt she was amazing with children, but I just don't feel comfortable leaving my baby in her care, one on one. I'm happy for her to spend time with the baby when my husband and I are watching, but I can't fathom leaving her to babysit. 

Am I being unreasonable? How can I explain to my husband that leaving a baby in the care of someone who needs care themselves is simply not safe, without hurting his feelings?","I think it’s a conversation that may go round in circles, and perhaps it’s best to park until baby is born, and make a judgement when you are spending time all together and see how she interacts with the baby. 
She may well raise a red flag that your husband will see and come to the conclusion himself.

My dad has Alzheimer’s and as yet we are not sure if my mum will be able to look after him and the baby.. (big dogs, leaving doors open etc). She’s desperate to, but we will just assess the situation when baby arrives.
You’re absolutely not being unreasonable. I don’t really have any advice on how to talk with him about this, sorry. I am sure some other people will have ideas. Just needed you to know that you’re not wrong here.
Of course you're not being unreasonable.  I agree with you completely.  If it were me in your shoes, I'd say ""We don't agree on this, but I'm asking you to respect my point of view even though we don't agree.  A childcare solution has to be something both parents are comfortable with.""
You are not being unreasonable in the slightest. I am pregnant too and would never even consider it. The thing with Alzheimer's is that they can have an unexpected extreme downturn. This happened with my Dad's wife where one minute they were finde and the next she said he was homeless and trying to steal her money and needed to leave. This lasted several days and was extremely sudden. There is no predicting the progression of this disease. Just because one stage has been slow, doesn't mean the next one will be.
Babies cannot inform you of things are going wrong. Absolutely not.
Don't do it. Please. Bad idea.
Even if she //is// ok with babies now, that's no guarantee for the future. It's impossible to know what her condition will be like 2, 6, 10, etc.  months from now. Things have changed and will continue to change, and they'll do so unpredictably. My mom used to be a kindergarten teacher. In a little less than a year, she has gone from being mostly independent to needing 24hr supervision so she doesn't accidentally burn the house down. The plummet can be fast and it comes with no warning.
I would say if your husband is worried about MIL having a relationship with her grandchild, remind him that she will, just with an extra pair of eyes keeping watch. If he's worried about the logistics/finances of hiring a nanny, I would tell him that regardless of whether it's now or later, you //will// need someone to help you, and at some point, MIL will no longer be able to do that. Why rely on such a short-term solution when you could create backup plans from the start? It doesn't hurt to see who's available and get an idea of the costs. 
Best of luck!
Wow, what a tough thing to throw into the mix when you are expecting a baby. Sending you a lot of love and patience. It sounds like your husband doesn’t have insight into your MILs disease and capacity. I am a nurse and often see family members in denial - it’s a common defence mechanism for themselves. However, ultimately very unhelpful. 

Some suggestions: 
1) Table the conversation to give your husband more time to realise on his own your MIL babysitting isn’t safe. 
2) Have a mediated discussion with a professional who has experience with dementia. 
3) Can your husband look after your MIL to give your SIL some respite? This might help with gaining some insight? 

I would not leave a baby with someone with dementia. It is not safe.",2021-04-22 23:36:03,ohwhatevers,mwmerz
Alzheimers,My mother only has one delusion/paranoia,"My mom was diagnosed with vascular dementia 2 years ago and she only has one symptom of that my dad is having an affair.  He is 84 and verified he is not (in case you were wondering as everyone asks).

Her delusions enrage her as she thinks he sneaks out in the middle of the night (cameras on the house does not help as she thinks they are hacked), that ""the woman"" follows them when they drive and that she watches them from the trees in the backyard.     


Her memory is still perfect. Intelligent. On good days (without delusions) she is almost perfectly normal and sweet.  No UTI (verified several times) and no thyroid issues (verified by endocrinologist).   


Is this normal to only have this psychotic delusion that kicks in 1 out of every 3 days or so? (Sundowning does occur)","Cheating was at the top of my mom’s list of hallucinations. She was sure Dad was having a Skype affair when she first started to go off the rails and I would sit down and show her that all the calls were initiated and ended in 5 seconds with no one answering and also the screen shots she had taken off herself scowling while clicking around looking for evidence but not knowing what she was doing. It evolved into her constantly saying he kept asking her for a divorce, Dad would always shrug and look confused when she would say this. I tried many approaches but the one that finally worked was when I told her that my siblings and I are in her corner and will make sure she is taken care of no matter what happens and then I would start to talk about something else. If she looked like she just needed to rant about something I would bring up someone who had done her wrong in her past and let her go on about them. It’s so uncomfortable to listen to the “your dad is cheating” rants and it wears you down. You have my sympathy.
As much as 1 very specific delusion is rare nothing is uncommon with dementia purely because everyone has a different journey but certain aspects are common to most stories.
One morning my wife asked me with a hurt voice “why did you have sex with a stranger in our bed last night”. Even asking her questions like what were you doing in the bed while I was having sex with this woman, wouldn’t change her mind. And let me tell you it hurts as much the 50th time as the first time you get asked this question.",2021-04-23 04:46:06,veritas247,mwqw9a
Alzheimers,How to find a good nursing home?,"My boyfriend's mother has Alzheimer's and her sleep schedule has been rough and it has taken a toll on his job trying to take care of her. Many nursing homes neglect the people they take care of, how would someone find a good nursing home that takes good care of their patients?","nursing homes are highly regulated so you can read all reviews and things they got marked down on online. try to find an Alzheimer’s specific unit if you are able and visit as often as you can :)
There are two things I recommend. If there is a chance your BF's mom will end up bankrupt and need Medicaid to pay for her memory care home, find a Medicaid facility right away. We made that mistake and my mom spent three years in a private pay community. When she started to run out of money, we were advised we needed to start looking into moving her. The waitlists were insanely long.

We finally got her into one and they got great ratings and lots of people told us they were exceptional. Within a month, I'd gotten a call from the hospital ER that my mom had been dropped off at the check-in desk and was being admitted. The nurse at the memory care community didn't call me until hours later, and the administrator never did. I was busy trying to coordinate things in the meantime as they'd dropped her off without a change of clothing, no medications, and without her medical file.

That place had exceptional ratings and feedback from many in my community, so (second) I don't trust reviews anymore. Read state safety inspection reports and see what the deficiencies are. Visit the places, pay close attention to the patients within, and when possible, surprise visits do a lot more than planned ones.
I have heard that the best way to get good care for your loved one in a nursing home is to visit often.

You probably can check with the state's licensing agency for complaints and abuses in a particular home.

Other than that, word of mouth is useful - talking to others who have a relative in a local nursing home.

Nursing homes are expensive.  If a night attendant in the home is tried, it might be cheaper as well as more satisfactory.
Some who worked at my mom's facility told me to show up without warning and ask for a tour. If they say no, they might be hiding something. At both of my moms homes they were able to have me take a tour minutes after walking in.
She could go to a board and care home, which is much cheaper than a nursing home. Assuming she doesn’t need like IV maintenance or anything “medical” and just caregiving. A nursing home is much worse IMO because the nurse to patient/resident ratio is so high.",2021-04-22 14:51:28,JuniperFulgur,mwbt9u
Alzheimers,Apple AirTags,"Hey friends - 

A lot of posts have been about how to keep track of our loved ones as they wander. Apple announced their airtags yesterday - and from what I’ve seen, it could be a helpful solution. Think it works a lot like any other iOS / apple device where you can enable ‘find my…’ on it. I’m not sure of the range - but it’s a hell of a lot cheaper (and likely easier) than convincing our person to wear an Apple Watch or carry their phone, etc. 

My dad wasn’t a wanderer (thank heavens) but I know how incredibly stressful taking care of someone with this dumb disease is. If it helps make your life a little easier, it’s worth it. 

Lots of different cases and whatnot, but the belt / collar case in this Gizmodo article seems ideal. My dad wore his belt every single day. With his suspenders. Silly goose. 

https://apple.news/Av2S9UqJJR_KftvPeRW-zaw","It's 800 feet, which is about 1/10th of a mile. My daughter said on her phone and watch, you can also ping where the item last was before it went out of range, which can be incredibly useful in searches.
It relies on a participating iPhone being within Bluetooth range to upload the location to apple’s servers.  Might help in finding someone in a mall where there may be lots of people with iPhones, might not be so good when that person is wandering the neighborhood.
Sounds like the same as Tile, only with Apple instead of Android, yeah?

Alzheimers,My Dad Forgets About Things He Eats and Life,"So My Dad and I both have some issues with memory. His was initially thought to be due to B12 vitamin deficiency. 

However, even after taking vitamins he continues to forget things like whether he has eaten something from the fridge, recalls about our lives in a disordered way as well, and forgets things like when major events happened in our lives. 

Did anyone else have similar experiences before diagnosis with family members? My sister thinks he is lying at times but it is pretty clear to me and my mother that he has worsening memory problems that won't be solved by vitamins.","Yes those things seemed to happen with my mom before she was diagnosed. I don’t think there was ever a thought her memory was due to B12 deficiency though - Alzheimer’s just runs in the family.
Your physician can rule out possible causes including B12 deficiency using a blood test. Any possible medicine that he is taking might be discontinued to rule out side effects due to medications. An MRI will help make sure there isn't some other brain issue causing memory loss. So sorry you are going through this.
Update: Mine seems to be worse than his. I'm forgetting longer term things like people and names, places, events. He is better but also has some issues. I've terminated care for myself for reasons.
Even if he did have a B12 deficiency, that I assume is being treated by supplements, that doesn't mean he can't also develop dementia.  He needs a good, thorough diagnosis including neuropsych testing.",2021-04-20 22:32:21,,mv6ff0
Alzheimers,Step Mum refusing to walk with carers,"My step mum now has 24/7 care. My Dad still lives at home with her but he just can't cope with all of her care needs. She has PCA so ha almost her ability to read or really watch TV. The only thing she wants to do is wall, continuously. Today she told the carer to leave her alone and that she was going to call the police on them. She then tried to walk across a busy dual carriageway to get away from the carer. The carer has, understandably refused to walk with her anymore as she feels like it is dangerous.

My Dad wants to be able to come to visit us and his grandson once a week but now feels he can't leave. If they lock the front door and say she can't go for a walk she starts banging on it and screaming that she is being held hostage.

I don't really know why I'm posting. It's just so unfair. My poor Dad is at breaking point.","I'm so sorry to hear about your situation 😔 so, your step mom's carer is still willing to care for her, just not go on walks?
My grandmother went through a similar situation. She used to take walks alone all the time before the disease but it was obviously getting dangerous. One time we followed her closely and she began to walk out of the city limits and onto busy roads. We had to call the police to take her home. Same thing afterwards she would bang on the doors and scream for help. Soon after the pandemic hit and she started progressing worse She actually ended up not walking out by herself anymore. Once she got into the latter stages her behaviors started changing rapidly. It is different for every patient. It is ""fortunate"" I guess that her mood swings and wandering ended up being taken away by the disease. Not sure if anyone else experienced similar or different in the later stages
I'm sorry about your situation and I feel you very much. It's just good to be able to talk. Just yesterday my dad go very angry and accused the persons living in the same house as him - that is his wife (my mother), his eldest son (my older brother), who live with him in the house we've all grown up in since 1984 - of keeping him hostage and wanted to leave.

Alzheimers,Dad’s new delusion,"Today my mom let me know that my dad (early onset, mid stages) has been demanding to speak to or write a letter to the Pope about his situation. He has never been very religious (and never catholic) but is taking a very ‘I need to speak to the manager’ approach to this delusion. Thankfully it passes quickly and amuses my mom. Just wanted to share a funny-ish story in an otherwise very plateaued situation","I’ve had similar experiences as a caregiver, except it usually involved (deceased)presidents or parents. I found the best approach was/is always to redirect first, if possible, but that in itself can be difficult as averting can be only a temporary solution. It’s also a matter of whether the demand/request/fixation is harmless or detrimental. 

Having him write the letter may actually be beneficial because it could be an outlet for him to vent his frustrations/concerns. Obviously it could also lead to additional fixations or demands. So it’s one of those things where you weigh the situation’s risk/reward. 

I had a client who for months insisted on speaking with Nixon, mind you this was five years ago. Eventually I relented, told him to write a note and that I would personally mail it. So we did, and we sealed it up and I took it with me when I left. The next day he asked about it, I said it would take a week or so for it to get to Washington D. C. Well that week turned into two weeks, then four, and so on. He eventually forgot about it and never mentioned it again. Sometimes it’s just a matter of fulfilling a wish or need, even if it makes no sense.
My grandma tried to order herself a cheeseburger at KFC. Twice. She asked me to take her to KFC, and then does that... 🤦‍♀️🤣
Its very.... not funny, obviously, but also hilarious at the same time. Very confusing times 😅
Thank you! We’ve handled past situations a similar way (cards to deceased parents), and can usually divert with another task. Reading and writing are becoming more challenging but we’ve had him dictate some notes and it seems to help him vent.
So you're saying ALZ can bring out his ""Inner Karen""? In my wife's mind she's split me into 2 people ""Good Paul"" and ""Evil Paul"". Whenever she gets frustrated with me usually for not wanting her to run outside to go see her (long deceased) parents or (grown and on the West coast) kids I become the evil one to her.

During our arguments about her staying in the house, she's zinged me a few times, once when I tried to assure her that I was indeed her husband and she probably shouldn't be wandering the streets a 3am, she told me ""You're not my husband, he's MUCH better looking!"" Hah!, You sure told me...

Another good one was when I was trying to reason with her and mentioned that she had ALZ and she lit up and asked ""How do you know it's not YOU that has ALZ?"". Why inded!
My grandmother would hide in the closet because she thought the Japanese were going to get her (she was a WWII widow).  Not funny as I say it now, but at the time you have to have some levity
Sure, Dad. Let me get some of the good stationery. After all, it is the Pope. Now, what's the address for the Pope? Okay, good. Now how do you want to address the Pope?

Alzheimers,Caregviver - how do you get away / manage stress,"Any tips for caregivers to manage stress and be able to have a life outside of taking care of a parent with dementia ?

I find myself trapped at the house and unable to get away to enjoy anything.  I am in my 40's and not married and no kids.  My mother is 75, has dementia and takes several important meds for heart transplant and other issues.  My brother has pancreatic cancer so has been super stressful the last year and not sure how to get away for a break.  

Just struggling for ways to ""escape"" my situation from time to time.","I would recommend asking friends/family to stop by for a few hours to give you a break, or consider hiring someone to come in for a few hours. You need a break and you deserve a break.
I’ve been making the most of my time with my mom by indulging in hobbies while I’m sitting with her- I have my PS4 set up in her living room with a small monitor and a headset over one ear so she can sit and watch tv but still have my attention, a small quiet practice pad to practice drum rudiments on, and I sometimes draw while I’m there. Get a little selfish if you can, it’s been almost a year for me caring for her in our home, but I’ve at least improved as a drummer and with drawing wherever I can. Still suck at video games though.
I hire a caregiver to watch my Dad 2-3 days a week and leave town. I swear that has SAVED me. Still cheaper than a care facility!
I was the only living son and took care of my dad as well as working full time from home for a few years. 

We didn't have any family within (edit thousands of miles) but we did have a company where we paid caregivers to come over  to give me/us breaks every once in awhile.  I went to some caregiver support meetings which helped early on. 

Getting some time to go out to the gym, or to play Pokémon,  or out for any reason kept me halfway sane to keep going. 

Near the end, we had a hospice that would send caregivers to give some supplies, help bathe dad,  and take him into their facility for a couple of days a month. 

I really recommend to make some time for yourself and doing something physical can really help get your mind off things for a bit.
A lot depends on your family situation. My mom's siblings live on the other side of the world, and we don't have cousins nearby that she trusts enough to spend time with. She let her social group shrink after her Alzheimer's diagnosis, so my brother and I had no one else to turn to for help. 

We looked into home care services, but the cost was far more than my mom had available after her prescriptions, household expenses, etc. People often asked me what about free caregiver services from churches, etc. but nothing like that exists in my area. I couldn't afford to pay for care on my own as I have my own bills and house to pay for. 

We reached a point after she started wandering where she had to go into assisted living after selling her home. That helped us a lot and after a few months, she really began to enjoy her new surroundings and friends. Sometimes, assisted living isn't as bad as some make it out to be. We researched heavily, popped in routinely to see how things were going, and got to know the staff by spending hours in the community at different times of day/shifts.
Two words:  Respite care.
I hired a “friend” for my mother to come in 2 days a week. She takes her out to lunch, her church or to walk Walmart.  The “friend” is 70s, my mother is 86 and they talk and talk about nothing.  I was able to find her for $15/hr.",2021-04-19 16:10:38,sportsguyred,mu9cp4
Alzheimers,Bracelets and Car Safety - Need Advice,"My dad's (74) dementia has progressed -- the last time he took a MoCA test (last year), I think he scored about a six or a seven. He is still living at home with my mom (74). My siblings and I have been encouraging her for at least a year to get some in-home help, so she can run errands, go to activities, and get a break regularly. She has resisted, for a lot of reasons.

We just learned today that dad has stepped out of a moving vehicle (happened this week, while my uncle is visiting them). Dad walked almost a mile down the road, while they looped back around to get him. Mom admitted to my brother that it wasn't actually the first time he had done that. He will also sometimes leave the house if he gets frustrated or angry. I am looking at bracelets for him (that are not removable by the wearer). His main health concern is the dementia. I would assume it should say his name, that he has dementia, his address, and my mom's phone number? Anybody have good luck with bracelets? I have been looking on Medical ID Fashions online -- I want to get one that is comfortable, but sturdy.

Also, against our advice, mom is taking him away from home this summer to visit her family. They are being driven half-way across the US by friends, then flying home. She is now saying they may stay for six weeks (originally, it was two weeks). I offered to go stay with him, but mom declined. She wants him to see everybody one last time. (He no longer knows any of them -- my mom is usually his ""girlfriend"" or ""the lady."") I have spoken to his social worker, who spoke to his primary dementia physician, and they have said they do not want him to go -- my mom knows this. But we can't make them stay at home. We know that you can enable the child locks in the back seats. They will have to stay the night at least once on the way there (I think it's about a 19-hour drive). Does anyone have advice for road and vacation safety? They will be staying at a lake place, and I am so nervous about him getting lost in lake country. The lake place is yards from the water.

My siblings and I are going to move our messaging from ""you need an assistant"" to ""now is the time you need to pursue getting him into residential care."" We try to be gentle and non-judgmental. As is often the case, this is an elderly person taking care of another elderly person. Mom can be very stubborn, and stops speaking to us if she feels pressured, so it is a delicate procedure to guide her to better care for dad and for herself. Thanks for any advice.","What about getting her help with things that support her idea of herself as a comfortable woman of means?  A house cleaner/keeper, gardeners, laundry service, a personal chef?

Doing all the house work plus caregiving is a hell of a load, and if she's refusing to allow help with her husband, then perhaps you can lift some of the other burdens.  You know, the boring, repetitive, manual labor that nobody really wants to do, that's so invisible that nobody ever thinks about it because nobody wants to think about it?  I bet she doesn't want to think about it either.

How nice it would be to have someone come in a few times a week with fresh fruits, who would do the dishes, clean the kitchen, put on a pot of soup, and do the laundry!  Delightful!  Even better if that person could keep an eye on him (after she got used to and trusted them them of course) so she could go do something for herself.   But that last part isn't necessary.  Just lifting some of the work off her would likely help A LOT.
> I would assume it should say his name, that he has dementia, his address, and my mom's phone number? 

Great idea, you ought to get him one for sure, but, umm, I wouldn't put all that, it's a bit distressing and/or humiliating for many alzhms/dementia people, putting their private medical info out there for all the world to see.  I understand your thinking, makes it easier for members of public who might find him, to understand the memory loss issues, but especially for many oldies, it's stigma around dementia.... Plus anyway, you're too trusting, that's just inviting scammers or opportunist burglars/kidnappers.   Unless you live in very small town or something, idk.  

Here down under, we can get ""Safe Return"" bracelet from AlzheimersAustralia, I assume the Alzhms / Dementia Orgs in every country have them.  Same as diabetics/epileptics can get.  You pay like $70 & order one, it has no personal identifying info engraved on it, it has it's own ID number (your dads) data recorded on database that only police, ambulance, hospitals, emergency services can access.  They're almost impossible to take off, can shower etc.   Got one for my mum 7 yrs ago, never takes it off.  

And your moms vacation plans, well, maybe before that happens she'll rethink that.  Otherwise, you can't really force her.  Who knows, maybe it might be ok with him.  Trying to get her to accept in-home care, or start searching suitable facility, yeh what if she has a stroke or hit by cyclist & suddenly can't care for him - she ought to plan for that.  Dementia .orgs and alzheimers .orgs have tons of resources, advice, counselling, etc - get on to them!

Best of luck with everything!
First, good luck to you and your family during this difficult period that is unfortunately probably going to get worse. I lost my Grandmother after watching this horrible disease destroy her brain over the course of 8 years. Part of what I did so that I could get as much knowledge as possible is to become a certified trainer for a program called Dementia Dialogues that is designed for the caregiver and the family of the Alzheimer’s patient as opposed to information relating to the actual patient. I am not sure if it is a national program or not, but you can register for online seminars. I admit it has been several years since I took my recertification, so I am not exactly sure how distance learning works. Here are a couple of links to check out: 

About Dementia Dialogues (Note the information regarding self-paced learning at the bottom of the page) [https://sc.edu/study/colleges\_schools/public\_health/research/research\_centers/office\_for\_the\_study\_of\_aging/projects\_programs/dementia\_dialogues/index.php](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/public_health/research/research_centers/office_for_the_study_of_aging/projects_programs/dementia_dialogues/index.php)

Regarding the question on the Medical ID, technology has advanced since the time when my Grandmother was diagnosed. When considering any type of wearable, you need to consider if you will be using GPS technology or not. You have already indicated you wanted one that he could not remove, and there are numerous sites that sell them. The information you put on the bracelet is critical for police, fire, or EMT’s should he, unfortunately, get lost. Things to consider is to talk to her primary care doctor to ensure you have the latest medical conditions as well as the pharmacy so that you know what medications are important (for example, you would want to have any blood thinners listed in case of a traumatic accident. The is a list of abbreviations that doctors, first responders, and EMT’’s use to be able to shorten the information, but still, be able to provide very valuable medical information. Also, you would want to have “ICE” (In Case of Emergency) contacts listed. Also, consider other items like is he diabetic or if he has a pacemaker (No MRI if that’s the case). The Alzheimer’s Association website has a page on it called “Wandering Support” that you may want to check out. They are teamed with MedicAlert to provide bracelets and different paid membership plans that provide 24/7 support through notification to authorities, family support, and support for the patient. Note that I do not know anything more about the program other than it is sponsored by the Alzheimer’s Association. Additional information can be found here: [https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/safety/medicalert-with-24-7-wandering-support](https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/safety/medicalert-with-24-7-wandering-support).

The biggest thing you can do for your Father, in my opinion, is to try and provide as much detail (but not all at once) to your Mom. She will not be able to care for him, particularly when he starts “sundowning” (staying up all hours of the night and potentially wandering off). This is in direct conflict with your Mom’s schedule and trying to keep up with him 24/7 will wear her out very quickly and could jeopardize her health. This is where the distance learning about the Dementia Dialogues program referenced earlier is invaluable, not only for your Mother but your entire family and friends. When I first took the classes, I was astonished at how much I did not know and since my Mother was on the “front line” with my Grandmother, she got to a point where she was unable to make any decisions and was paralyzed due to the situation.

A couple of other items to jot down for future actions: Are there any Wills or Trusts in place, does he have private insurance to help place him in a facility quicker than someone who is dependent on Medicare to provide for them. Finding a bed at a good facility is expensive and if he does not have insurance, bed availability could be an issue because providers restrict the number of beds allocated for Medicare patients (they prefer private pay insurance much more than government-subsidized payments). Also, are there any living wills or medical directives like “Do Not Resuscitate” (DNR)?

Apologize for the long post, but I do hope it helps you or someone else that is in a similar position. Watching that horrible disease take my Grandmother was very hard and emotionally taxing to the point that I would not wish that on my worst enemy. Keeping you in my good thoughts and wish you the absolute best. It will be a very difficult process as the disease progresses.
If mom is adamant about that trip, perhaps you could go along to be an additional caregiver preventing dad from getting in trouble, leaving a moving car, getting lost etc.  Mom will also probably get more out of visiting with her family (she probably REALLY NEEDS that) if you are there to watch him.",2021-04-18 22:24:22,t-brave,mtr3qs

Alzheimers,My grandma has been getting worse and I'm having a real hard time dealing with this. Any advice?,"My grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's three or four years ago and so it's been getting more and more rough. She lives with me and my mom, stepfather, my brother and sister, and it's getting to the point where we can't handle it anymore. We're all doing our best obviously. This past week has been the worst. Every day, her episodes are starting with her saying she wants to go home, and she tries to leave the house, and after not being able to leave, she cries. She thinks she's being trapped somewhere, I guess, and that we're being evil by not taking her home. It's been happening at least once a day for the past week. Last Friday, she started banging her head on the window because she wanted to escape. I've heard her say ""Please God, take me. Take me right here and right now."" Yesterday before I went to work, she told me ""I'm sick. I can't take care of myself."" And then, she said she feels like she's in this evil place. 

It is absolutely traumatic and upsetting to see my grandma this way. Someone I've known and loved my whole life, who was a completely different person before (obviously). It's really affecting me. I can't get it out of my mind. I can't focus on anything else. It's just that we seem to have entered a new stage of this disease, and it's been awful to watch. My boyfriend told me yesterday that he's concerned about me b/c I'm really really fixating on it and it seems to be taking a toll on me. He's right. My friends and coworkers have all noticed too. My brother told me if it's affecting me that much, then I don't have to feel the need to be as involved as I've been. But, I'm still just really having a hard time dealing with it, internally. What can I do?! What can I do to calm myself down more? I still need to step in and help but I need to take care of myself.","It is one of the hardest things you'll experience. And there's really not much you can do but to distract. 

There's a viral video that hit the media this week from Loveland, Colorado, where an officer arrested an older woman who'd shoplifted at Walmart. She kept saying she was ""going home."" I was outraged. ""I'm going home"" is simply a way to express uncertainty and displeasure for the situation because they don't feel safe. You lose your memories, it's impossible to feel safe when you can't remember where, why, or how you are where you are.

In all the hours I've spent with my mom in her memory care community, ""I want to go home"" or ""I""m going home"" is the most common thing I hear. If you try to stop my mom when she is in her ""I'm going home"" mode, she will hit, punch, scratch, and shove to get away from you. That action led to her being removed from her memory care community and dropped off at a hospital ER without her medications or a change of clothes, which I learned is legal for them to have done. She's now out of state as my state doesn't have memory care facilities for aggression, so I can't see her until I'm fully vaccinated. She will not participate in video chats, window visits, or phone calls.

What I find worked best during her worst moments was to tell her that we'll go walk her home. A walk around the yard or neighborhood usually worked. When that stopped working, I'd walk to a local bakery with her and buy one treat to eat on the walk and then refrigerated treats like tiramisu. She'd need to get it ""home"" to her refrigerator, so there was no argument and her entire mindset shifted to getting back with her sweet treats before they spoiled.
Sometimes by ""home"" the patient means their childhood home; it's the early memories that persist longest.  She doesn't recognize the location she's in now.  

A skill that you seem not to know is creative lying and redirection.  For example, a skilled Alzheimer caregiver might say ""We can't take you home today because the house is being painted, but we'll take you tomorrow.""  It's a total lie, but she will have forgotten by tomorrow.  Meanwhile, give her something else to think about:  ""Would you care for tea and cookies now?""  or ""It's time for your walk in the yard.""

You shouldn't feel any guilt for telling your grandmother things that calm and soothe her.  Just as a parent might have to obscure the truth of something too mature for a child to understand, a caregiver can paint a more comfortable picture of reality.",2021-04-17 00:51:15,JordanLeigh7,mskbuh

Alzheimers,The Personal and Financial Toll Alzheimer’s Takes on Women of Color,,,2021-04-14 14:04:40,Madame_President_,mqw95u
Alzheimers,How am I suppose to ever be happy again,"My mom has dementia with Lewy body. She’s 75. I’m 39 (single no kids and actively trying for both). My moms condition majorly worsened the last 6 months. But not horrible. It’s an insane depressing but grateful place to be. She knows everyone. But she can’t be alone. She won’t admit it. She’s depressed. She’s terrified. No short term memory. Cant
Really reason but also can. Anyway. I know this will only get worse. I have her on every med and with every doctor. I know how this ends up. Her dad and sister had it too. I know the deal. It’s my worst nightmare came to life. She was my best friend. Good morning texts. Good night texts. Knew where each other was at evert moment. How am I ever supposed to be happy again? Genuinely. I have a great boyfriend. Were tying for a baby after a recent miscarriage. But I don’t see ever being truly happy ever again. Not losing my mom like this.","That’s where you are, right now. Losing a mom is so hard for any child. Specially for kids who have the kind of relationship you seem to… You’ve been incredibly blessed to have your mother. Watching them slip away in the ebb and flow is excruciating. 

It doesn’t get easier, only harder. You’ll hate yourself and them at some point before it’s over. You’ll question the wisdom of medications and doctors trying to prolong a terminal disease.

Find the humor in it, find the joy and let the pain pass through you without having a home. The pain will poison your memory of them.

Keep every text, voicemail, and note you have. Ask in her lucid moments the things you want to know about her life. Have her do a DNA test so you can share these things with your future children who won’t know her. A child can’t replace your mom, but you can find her and yourself in them. It gives a sense of continuity. 

There can be happiness and peace at the end of this. How long that journey takes is unique to you. You won’t be the same, this is one of the worst losses and the worst ways to lose them.

I find myself visiting the memory of my mother during happy times. She’s always there in the back of my mind sharing the moments that matter. What they lose is where they live when the battle is done.
Grief overwhelms you and when you are in the midst of it, it's the only thing you see and the only thing you can *imagine* seeing.  With dementia, you lose your loved one before their body dies so the grief is so much longer.  It's an awful disease.  The thing is, life keeps happening.  As you move ahead, normality creeps in around the edges and there are gaps in the trees where you glimpse the sun again.  As you move ahead, these glimpses get more and more frequent and occasionally you reach a clear spot when you can bask for a bit before the shadows close in again.  Finally, you emerge and while you once in a while find yourself in a dark spot those occasions become much rarer.  You find that those feelings of grief are more bittersweet than debilitating.  You'll come out the other side.  Joy will find a place in your life again.  This isn't disloyal to your mom or her memory, it's what she always dreamed of for you.
I'm so sorry, hon. Its rough... lost my Mom a couple years ago to early onset Alz. Its hard watching them struggle... seeing how frustrated they get when they can't do something simple. And they KNOW something is wrong. Even when my Mom forgot what it was she had, she knew she had something wrong but couldn't name it, and that would frustrate her. Just keep comforting... something my Dad would say was, ""We are just taking it one day at a time and we are gonna get through it together."" Brings a tear to my eye even now... he took care of her up to her last breath at home. Talk about rough... but yeah, I can't say it will get better, but the emotional part does get sort of easier, as you go through. 

Just do what you can to make her happy, keep her engaged when you can. Remove things or change things that frustrate her and when she gets upset, distract until she forgets. It sucks big time and you can't always explain something to them... but just distract to cause less pain and heartache. My Mom went through a phase for three or four days straight of wanting to talk to her parents who had died decades before after seeing their photo. Grieved all day long and sobbed.. it was hard to deal with. Finally we just took the photos down and hid them. Better not to cause the grief than to just pretend and go along with things they think are real. 

Another one was my Mom forgot who SHE was.... would see herself in a mirror and think a stranger was in the bathroom watching her go potty. Sigh. So we covered the mirrors in the house. No more issues, at least with that. 

Try to laugh when you can, crack jokes, do silly things to make HER laugh. Humor always helped with my Mom. She always smiled (even when she stopped being able to talk) when we called each other a Butthead (family joke).....

Hang in there. Its not an easy road, but you're not alone.
like your mom now has to, find joy in the moment.  

You have this amazing innate ability to retain those moments of joy, and recall them.  like others in this thread, find the joy and the humor. It never complete removes the heartache and the frustrations, but it does make it more bearable.  Also, like others have said, take care of yourself, don't let your own physical and mental health suffer. Taking care of you will help you take care of your mom.
Losing your mom twice, which is essentially what is happening.  First she forgets you, then she goes.  Been there in 2010.  You will be happy again, but with spurts of OMG what will I do, how I wish I had done more, I’m so sad, etc.   grieving is a process.  One day you will laugh and feel guilty about being happy.  And at some point you will not remember that you are supposed to be sad all the time and find yourself enjoying a moment (or two).  I wish you the best of luck with all you will be going thru in the next months.  Internet hugs to you.
I was you back in 2018. I'm 39 also so about the same stage in life.

Even when I was relatively happy or in a good mood I still had that bubble of anxiety in my head, like a cloud. My mom was late stage at that point and non vocal for years. I think the last coherent conversation I had with her was maybe late 2015? I saw no end and was seriously considering breaking up with my now wife because I felt like I was dragging her down with me. I had basically given up at that point and the only thing keeping myself and my family together was our ridiculously sick sense of humour thanks to entirely too much Monty Python over the years.

My mom passed in late 2018 and not a day goes by I don't think about her. She used to love playing Nintendo and was into Animal Crossing. My sister and I just got into it for the Switch and both remarked how mom would've liked it.

Sorry, I think this reply is more me venting/bragging, but I'm now married to my amazing wife and we just had our first daughter in January. Because of what we went through COVID has been a breeze. I'm proud of what we went through and frankly I could end up homeless in a gutter but can still be proud of what we did. We're now the go-to couple when our friends need help or support. We're both still dealing with mental health issues of course, and I'm on a baby dose of an anti depressant, but it feels like the last stages of physiotherapy after major surgery.

I guess what I'm trying to say is there is light at the end of the tunnel. No one who hasn't been through this will really understand the constant anxiety, self doubt, fear, anger, shame, overall shitiness, the fucking crying in your car, lack of sleep, horrible thoughts, etc.

You will get through this. You are a stronger person because you were there for your mother. Nobody can take that from you. You will have your child, even if it means shooting down a stork mid-flight.

Alzheimers,"Help me, help her break old habits nicely?? Please?","My 76yo grandmother has been in and out of doctors offices for the past 2 months, we don't have a diagnosis yet, though her doctor is on the same page as me as far as assuming it's Alzheimer's of some sort. She owns a business and recently got it into a bunch of trouble which took some time for them to get out of and she is stuck in the mindset that she needs to get up every day and go to work, because that's all shes known lately. Probbaly for the past 40 years. They've hired someone else to essentially do the bookwork and man the front desk so that she can stay home, but she doesn't like being left out of things shop-related, and when she goes there, she doesn't know what she's doing and when she tries, she just messes things up and is sending her business downhill. She should retire--- I know she's thought about it, and I've tried to talk her into staying home nicely... my main point, I suppose--- is that noone has power of attorney for her yet but she really needs to just stay home and I don't know how to get her to do that without being rude about it or taking her car keys. Shes always been very independent and she has no intention of stopping. She lets me take her to all her doctor appointments because if she tries to go anywhere but work she gets lost and she refuses to get a cellphone. She got violent with her employee today and she's never been the violent type but I know that he's been getting frustrated with her being at the shop and she's said that she's scared of him because he reminds her of her awful exhusband... I think he triggered her somehow, but thats straying away from my main concern.... I've tried to talk her into staying home and it won't matter if she agrees because she'll just get up the next day and get ready for work and go. Anything we tell her goes in one ear and out the other. I'm at a loss, and its time to get an attorney involved, I know that, but is there a nice way for me to do it? She practically raised me and these past two months have driven ME crazy trying to keep her happy, and it breaks my heart to see her so broken without realizing she is. She tells me the same stories over and over and then gets confused that she's already told me--- I can't accept her word for anything... she asked me to take her out for lunch at KFC today and I did and she tried to order a cheeseburger, and when I explained to her that we were at KFC and they didn't have cheeseburgers and she accepted that, but then I asked her again what she wanted, and she tried ordering herself a cheeseburger, again... Idk what to do. Help... please... I apologize that this is so long... I took the opportunity to vent a little bit... I appreciate any feedback.","So sorry, that sounds rough, for both of you - it's very sad isn't it, and frustrating for you (and her, of course).    I think you ought to contact alzheimers .org  or  dementia .org for your area/country.   They are the specialists, have telephone help-lines, counselling, tons of info / resources / etc, they'll be able to give you good advice & tips & so on, about everything, all aspects.

Yes, you absolutely need to get that Powers of Attorney etc sorted out, quick fast!  Go with the ""but if you get hit by a car / have an accident & are unconscious or in coma, then it's too late to do POA, everybody normally already has that sorted out way before 60's, lets go do it, gran!"" 

best of luck!
You're doing the best you can, and so is she.  It's very frustrating to both of you.  No, you can't accept her word because to her it didn't happen.  Sorry you both are going through this.  We're here for any and all venting you need to do.

For KFC, there's too many choices.  Help her out by giving her two options.  Gram, do you want a chicken sandwich or the 2 piece meal?  (Or whatever she normally gets)  

For the shop, ""You hired those nice people to take some pressure off, lets do something fun today, and we'll go by the shop later.""   Or truly, any distraction and we'll go by the shop later, just don't.

Definitely get to an Elder attorney.  Make the appointment, and just get her there.
""Stay home"" is the wrong prescription.  She needs to get involved in senior activities.  Pandemic is still in effect but most cities have senior centers with activities and socializing, book clubs, choirs, lunches, things like that.  

The fact that the doctor is on the same page needs to be exploited.  Have THEM be the heavy - that's their job.  They need to take her driver's license away, something that primary care doctors have to do from time to time, they should know how.

But someone in the family needs to confront her with the effect she has on her business.  Did you say she got VIOLENT with an employee?  This has to stop.  It's not going to make her happy, but sometimes caring means pointing out uncomfortable truths.

It's not so much WHAT you say to her but HOW you say it.  Comments like ""I'm worried about you"" and ""It's time to get together to put down your medical proxy information"" and so on, if said in a kind but not condescending voice, and repeated as often as necessary, can usually do the trick.
While you are sorting out the POA I wonder if you could find any work she could do from home such as folding flyers or stuffing envelopes?  I wonder if she could be talked into going to a senior center to enjoy activities but tell her they need volunteers to help out. I think feeling useful is more important than the work itself in some cases.  When my mom was in assisted living she would cut our visit short and charge for the dining room when the towels and napkins would come in from laundry. She would sometimes complain that they were working them but she would get this fire in her eyes if she thought Gladys was going to fold more towels than her. Folding towels was one of the highlight of the day for some old gals.  We would give mom arts and crafts volunteer work which she would complain about and love at the same time. Making seasonal decorations for doors or bulletin boards was fun busy work for her and she felt like she was useful.",2021-04-13 16:34:36,TinyHam0722,mqayw6
Alzheimers,Early onset question ...,"My dad is 57 and has been showing signs for the past 5 years. At first we thought it was bipolar disorder because it involved a lot of mood swings and arguments. He still isn’t diagnosed because it doesn’t run in our family but in the past 2 years he is unable to work, drive, has no short term memory, has no idea about our finances, does not know when to eat or how to work any household electronics/appliances, has to be reminded to shower or wash his hands. I am shocked at how quickly he regressed. 

Has anyone else experienced this? When he gets diagnosed officially- what stage will he be in? Does this all count towards it? When your parents or relatives get diagnosed before 60, how long do they live in this in between limbo? How much longer do they have? He’s still somewhat independent when my mom works if she leaves reminders but the doctors tell her he cannot be alone. And yet no official diagnosis. We’ve been dealing with disability for over a year, how long does it usually take? 

Sorry, I’m asking for shared experiences. When you’re in your 20s, you don’t know many others going through this.","unfortunately this disease hits everyone different. symptoms, timeline, etc are all up in the air really...the “stages” are even more of a guideline for what to expect rather than a “this is definitely how it will go” guide. he may plateau for a while and live for ten more years with a slow decline, especially if he is diagnosed and tries medication. he may continue to regress rapidly and be unable to feed himself or use the bathroom on his own in just a year. (neither of these is particularly likely, but thats the spectrum of uncertainty you’re dealing with). 

best you can do is prepare for the worst and institute strict routines starting now. get that diagnosis ASAP. attend the appointment if you are able and report your own observations. make sure his will is in order, he has a first and second person chosen to make medical decisions for him; get the proxy forms signed and submitted. do the same thing with finances. 

have a long conversation with him about what HE wants if this progresses further. wait until hes having a good day and approach him with his wife and ask about what kind of end-of-life care he wants in different situations. i.e. what care he would want if he had moderate alzheimers, what care he would want if he broke a hip and couldnt walk, what care you should provide if he becomes incontinent or nonverbal. basically, you need to figure out at what stage HE feels that he would rather go into a home or assisted living than put the burden of his care on his family, and at what stage he would be comfortable having non-family caregivers come into his home and how long he wants to try to be independent (based on symptoms, not length of time since thats so uncertain).

try to convince him to start allowing a caregiver to come in for just a couple hours a day when his wife is at work; you said he shouldnt be alone anyway and then he can get used to the presence of caregivers while he’s still a little with it. 

routines: do your best to get him on a strict routine. wake up, shower, eat, take any meds, and do activities and go to bed at the same times every day. this is crucial for someone with this disease to have a semi functional life, and makes caring for him a lot easier as well. 

im sorry you are dealing with this, its really tough. genetics arent the only factor in this disease appearing, no one really knows the cause(s). do your best to figure out what he wants and what is best for him and try to find a compromise between the two. if he gets too aggressive, dont feel bad informing his doctor and asking about medications to manage mood swings. good luck.
I would definitely try to get him checked out sooner than later - having a diagnosis can make paperwork and such a lot smoother in the future. Maybe you guys could discuss with the doctor exactly what’s going on? Make sure someone is in the room with him - my mom would be able to lie her way out of things. Fake it til she makes it sort of thing but the reality was a lot different than what she was saying. 

There’s really no telling what “stage” he’s in. It’s not as linear as that unfortunately. My mom was diagnosed when she was like 61(I think honestly can’t remember for sure) and she did regress rather quickly. At this point she can still remember my name but we did have to move her into a nursing home because we weren’t able to give her the care she needed. Alzheimer’s patients can live with this disease for a long time - so there’s not really a great way to determine how long they’ll still be around. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this. I’m 26 and  really understand what you mean about other people our age don’t really understand.
It's important that he get a thorough and professional assessment, because there are some medical conditions that can mimic dementia but are treatable or reversible.  

I can't address how fast early onset goes, as my husband's case was in his 70s.  I have found a caregiver support group (at our senior center) to be very helpful both in terms of emotional support, but also information.  Good luck.
Sorry I am taking so long to respond. But I am jealous you received three comments, I put up many posts like yours over the years and sometimes would receive no comments.

I have been dealing with my wife's 59F Lewy bodies for about five years. (My current user name is fairly new. My old reddit user name is tied to a dead email and therefore I don't have many posts about her with my new user name).

It was a long and very painful process to get my wife diagnosed.

Her main neurologist cited a landmark study that said a woman in her 50's has a one in 50,000 chance (? it was a large number) of having dementia. So they tested her for everything else, they even tested her to see if she had a hole in her heart. When these tests came back negative, the neurologist said she was depressed and it was clouding her diagnosis. So for 6 painful months she saw a psychologist and two psychiatrists. After that he injected a shit ton of steroids into her neck and since she had a positive response for a couple of days. The neurologist was convinced this positive response meant her occipital nerves were constricted by scar tissue. I called to see if the referred surgeon accepted my insurance, when we showed up for the appointment the doctor was busy in emergency surgery and his colleague tried to convince us to let him perform the surgery at his private facility off campus for 25k out of pocket.   

Switched insurance again and went to a new hospital system. They gave her a shit ton of steroids in her neck again with no positive response this time, so they ruled out occipital nerve surgery.  This is when she took the last of her 3 MRI's (with a $500 co-pay each) that all came back negative. They said she passed the quick and dirty diagnostic test again, but her clock drawing was horrendous, she didn't even try to copy the parallelogram, and with a lot of help she got 3 of the memory words. The doctor basically said we don't know what is going on and implied there was nothing else they could do but wait to see if she gets worse.

This is when I turned to reddit. I would see a lot of posts from people with family members diagnosed with early onset dementia. I would reach out to them and ask what was test that confirmed their dementia?  They seemed confused by my questions and I really never got an answer. 

I did talk to an Alzheimer's researcher who suggested I ask my wife's neurologist if she could be genetically tested to see if she had the Alzheimer's gene. (this was over two years ago I forget what the strategy for doing this was). But once I made the request, the neurologist suggested a PET/CT scan with a glucose radiotracer injected one hour before the test. This is the test that found the Lewy body disease. Knowing what I know now, I would have paid a lot of money out of pocket to have this test done years earlier.

Regarding SSDI, the social security sub is very helpful. One area I disagree with most people in the sub is regarding hiring a lawyer. While most people in the sub say to apply for disability yourself, I was referred to a lawyer who specialized only in applying for disability insurance. I have heard that it takes on average two years to get approved for disability. Again at the time when we were applying, the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her and one of her psychiatrists even implied in a report that she might have been faking. My wife was approved for disability in less than six months. She didn't lose a dime of disability money and the clock for Medicare started as early as possible. The lawyer cost $2,400, less than one month of disability benefits. My wife had a lot positive factors for getting approved (previous income, work history, she was applying for and interviewing for jobs during the process). But everyone,  even the disability lawyers were shocked how quickly she was approved.

I also feel that I made a major contribution to the process. In my research on disability I found out that one of the major reasons for delayed approvals was missing copies of medical records. The medical records departments of hospitals are horrible. Of the roughly 10 medical records departments that I dealt with, only one person seem motivated/competent and he was a very senior citizen. Some departments still work with fax machines. The typical wait time for a request is two weeks, at two weeks you start calling they won't answer the phone or return voice mails. When you do finally get through they will try to say you made a mistake. I had one person try to tell me I misspelled my email address. I told her to look at my email address again, it is my name [JohnDoe@gmail.com](mailto:JohnDoe@gmail.com). I do know how to spell my own name. I chased down copies of all of my wife's medical records, scanned them and sent them as email attachments to the lawyer. 

I hope this helps, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. 

Good luck",2021-04-13 18:24:47,rge703,mqd3o7
Alzheimers,"My dad is 66. We think he is in the beginning stages of alzheimers. He checks all of the boxes, but is not someone that we could bring our fears up with.","My mom (63) and I (24) don't know what to do. She reached out to his doctor, but he told us we had to bring him in for tests if we want him tested. I think if we told him we thought his mind was going... well, he is a very proud man and would not take it lightly or try to understand. It would just start a very large fight and get us nowhere, except less trust from dad. He forgets everything and argues about things that he taught me. His moods bounce all over the place, and he gets frustrated very easily. Everything is everyone else's fault basically as well. I always knew I would be the kid to take care of my folks, and moved across the country with them to start that ball rolling. Now, with this starting, I'm terrified. I'm 24, I just figured out how to start taking care of myself. We were planning on buying a house together or some land, but now I'm feeling a lot more claustrophobic in that situation, considering the person who was going to handle most of it is now unable to figure out how to do basic things on his phone. I don't know how to get him any help with this without telling him we think he has alzheimers. And I really can't stress enough..... he would never admit that, even if he thought it himself, and would take it as a personal attack rather than something out of love and respect. 

He just got so frustrated because the avocado he took out of the fridge is not ripe by any means and he can't use it for breakfast. He is the one who taught me that putting it in the fridge keeps them from ripening. He argued with me and now I'm crying. Most of my life was spent having a rocky relationship with my dad, and now that it is resolved and we can start to build a good one, he is losing himself. It hurts. I know it isn't about me but this is so hard to wrap my mind around. I am worried that I am not/won't be strong enough to handle this. 

Does anyone here have any advice? Suggestions? Things that will make this feel any less groundbreaking??? I am young and a lot of my friends aren't ""there yet,"" if you know what I mean. Even my sister, who is..... 32 I think? lives in another state and always has. So she isn't here to see it all the time. Sometimes I tell her about things that he does (like trying to change the address on his pizza hut account through his phone's settings app) and she just laughs it off. Which, sure, that might sound funny, but witnessing it in person is horrifying. It has made me feel extra pressured to get my shit together before my dad is completely gone. 

I am in therapy, and have talked to her about this, but I know it is going to get worse before..... well, before it just ends. I have no one really who has experienced this first hand. Are there resources I could be utilizing any better?  Thanks in advance for reading through this.","Sorry you're going through this at such a young age! Check out https://www.alz.org/ ,it has some resources for caregivers and how to find your local Alzheimers chapter. Talk to your parents now about getting power of attorney. See if you can schedule a checkup for your dad, but make sure to tell the office your concerns about possible early alzheimers so they can work that into the exam. If his primary care won't do that, find one who will. Lastly, make sure you take care of yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup. ❤
First of all, dementia is a terrible thing, and I'm so sorry you're going through it.  It's emotionally dreadful not just for him but for you.

What I did to get my mom tested was to remind her she needed a checkup, and to call the doctor's office ahead of time to explain the situation and have them do a dementia test.  A good GP will be able to not make it feel like ""coming in for dementia tests"" but ""here's a set of things we're going to test including reflexes.""

Do not listen to your sister's opinions about your dad's cognition.   If she's not seeing him regularly, she doesn't know the difference between a ""senior moment"" and continuing failure to cope with the world around them.

I found the Alzheimer's organization website really helpful.  https://www.alz.org/alzheimer_s_dementia
You can call the Alzheimer’s Association and they’ll start to walk you through logistics. Your mom will want to try and start to get all the finances in her name. Make sure advanced directives are filled out and she has access to his medical records. There are some fantastic resources on the aarp website about how to get started down this path. 

I’m sorry this is happening to you. I’m going through it myself. My dad is also stubborn but I was able to get the legal stuff done with my parents as he started to decline by framing it as a “I just want to know what to do if something happens to you” sort of thing. It’s still a shit show, but at least I have legal POA if things get really bad. 

Good luck and hit me up if I can offer any more help.
I lost my dad last year to Alz at the age of 53, I was 23 at the time. Only thing I can say is to keep strong and tell yourself it's the disease talking, he's not himself. My dad said some hurtful things to me and my brothers when he was sick and still able to express himself, but that was only due to the fact that he was so confused. People with Alz don't know how to cope with the world and its impulses anymore, and they respond to that in a negative way to the people closest to them, which is you. He still loves you, he just doesn't know how to express that anymore. Remember how you were bonding before, and remind yourself of that feeling, because im 100% sure he still feels that way, he just can't express that anymore.

Stay strong and if you want to vent with someone your age, hook me up
Sorry to hear this. 
My dad also suffers and is a proud man. 
This isn’t advice because it’s not helpful but we didn’t find out until my dad was pretty progressed. We tried a number of years ago but at that stage it’s just classed as mild cognitive impairment and there was nothing the doctors would do. Now it’s full on Alzheimer’s and there’s still not really anything they can do. He went on drugs for a while but they made him even more depressed so we stopped those and actually fast forward a year or so and he’s on anti depressants now.

My main thoughts to you are these;

- it’s vital you create a support network. For you and your my mum as much as your dad. 
 It’s emotionally draining supporting someone with Alzheimer’s. They lose a sense of self, become negative, suspicious, detached, unable to do anything. It’s tough to watch but even harder to stay positive.
My mum has developed a voice condition from the stress of dealing with my dad so now I do half their admin including all phone calls. 
I strongly suggest finding ways to get your dad out the house to allow you both respite. Start early because new habits are hard to introduce later.

- recognise your dad will change and try to enjoy him for who he is. He won’t be the same dad you are used to and it can be easy to resent him for the impact it is going to have on yours and your mums life. But try to recognise it’s hard for him too and to try and enjoy him for what he is today. 

- consider finances now. The suspicion will only worsen and get harder. 

Good luck, it’s a tough ride and absolutely even more so at 24 :( I’m 33 and it’s shit!! 
However I would say my dads decline has been slow and started when I was around 18. Around 6/7 years ago it was classed as mild cognitive impairment and has only been classed as Alzheimer’s for the last year or so (he is around stage 5 of 7 currently).
My mom has vascular dementia and I found the following post. Very good. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kv7vb9/dementiaalzheimers\_disease\_progression\_for\_family/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kv7vb9/dementiaalzheimers_disease_progression_for_family/)
I’m sorry you are going through this and you need support.  My dad has dementia and it’s been a progression over years.  I think he hid it at first. He is less agitated and more dependent, though agitation is a common symptom and there may be medication to help with that when you consult a doctor. There are meds to slow progression but no cure yet. Exercise, routine and mental stimulation that does not cause stress are all good. Agitation for my dad kicks in more around 5 pm- sundowner. Eventually, You should get a healthcare power of attorney and ensure your mom is on all his accounts so as things progress there is stress.  Sometimes an outsider can suggest those steps to your dad more easily- a doctor, trusted friend, etc. The progression may take years so don’t panic.  You need to always take care of yourself too.  So does your mom. It’s hard but find the balance because it can become all consuming. They need your help, you need a life for yourself too and your siblings need to support. For my dad we have someone to come in a few hours a day to help him and cook and take pressure off my mom.
Hang in there. If he isnt noticing his own issues (which he prob is but is in denial), he will son and be able to ask for help. Stay patient and keep an eye on him.
I'm so so sorry that you're starting to go through this. I was 20 when my dad was diagnosed with early onset and it was devastating. It feels incredibly unfair to have a parent start to lose themselves right when you reach the age that you can start building a more complete and mature relationship, learn from them more, get life advice, etc. Unfortunately it will get worse, and things will be very confusing and sad at times for you and your family. 

And also unfortunately, the only way things can really start to improve is to have your dad understand what's happening and what you all are feeling. I don't know how or if that's possible with your situation, but everyone being on the same page in understanding what was happening to my dad was key to us moving forward and trying to enjoy our time together before things progressed.

Another thing that was super important for us was learning not to argue with him, at least most of the time. If he thought it was Sunday when it was really Tuesday or whatever it was, we just went along with it or changed the subject. Arguing or trying to make them understand that they're wrong will only make you and your dad upset, and for no real reason. 

All this being said, there still are good times that you'll have with your dad. Things will be different; you'll hear a lot about 'the new normal'. But hopefully you are all able to find beautiful moments and create good memories even through all the heartache. It's not easy, but you will get through this. My dad actually just passed away last night after 9 years of Alzheimer's. And it was extremely difficult but we have a lot of good memories throughout those years. And now that he's gone we're able to move on and celebrate all of his life with us, not just the Alzheimer's. Which is really a blessing after almost a decade of saying goodbye. 

I hope things improve for you and that you're all able to find some peace or understanding.
My dad was recently diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s, but we were expecting it (it’s genetic for him). He is also a very proud who doesn’t realize that he has an impairment. Getting him to stop driving was a nightmare (but I digress). One of the tests the neurologist gave him to check mental impairment was called the SLUMS test (St Louis University Mental Status test). You could google it and print off a copy. It would give a fairly good indication of his mental impairment (if there is any). You could give it discretely, ask a question here, ask a question there. 

Several people offered good advice on here to prepare yourself for down the road.  KestrelK had some good advice. 

https://www.alz.org is a good resource. Also getting in touch with a VA social worker to help with potential benefits as he gets worse, i.e. home care, day nurse, etc. Most libraries have some books on Alzheimer’s, what to expect, choosing to become a caretaker for an Alzheimer’s patient. I would also recommend finding a lawyer that specializes in elder care law and estate law (usually will go together), but the important part is elder care law. If you wait too long before getting things (finances, wills, etc) in order and your dad is declared incompetent, it is possible that you will have to petition the court to grant powers of attorney (basically appointing a guardian). This is how it is in my state.

Disclaimer: Sorry if it is rambling and disjointed. It has been a very, very long day and my brain is struggling.
Tell him it's a regular required checkup but inform the doctors office of your concerns. They will do some quick memory tests right in the exam room that will give them a general idea of where his cognition is now. The doctor will break the news to him. If needed they will refer him to a specialist. 

He sounds like my dad. I'm sorry, it's not going to be an easy road. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this so young.
Wondering if you can video any behavior that is off and show him later to convince him. It may be that he genuinely doesn’t understand what is happening to him.",2021-04-13 12:27:48,omgrafail,mq5tlo
Alzheimers,Looking for DNR Advice,"Hi everyone. At my mom’s recent annual physical, the doctor suggested completing a DNR form. I felt rushed so I checked no life saving measures except feeding/hydration. On further contemplation, it seems like maybe I shouldn’t have checked those when I know my mom does not want *any* lifesaving measures. Anyone done the form and have advice? I know this is a complicated and sensitive topic, but I appreciate any compassionate insight.","My dad's doc gave us the form but we didn't fill it out in office. We discussed it as a family and took it time discussing each item. You can always give them an updated one if you changed your mind on anything. I felt much butter getting it done.
Definitely take your time and do some research. There are a lot of myths about many of these things. For example, tube feeding doesn't really provide comfort and is often not tolerated well. They may make dying more uncomfortable.

There are also different feeding options typically. For example, hand feeding may have fewer risks.

[https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/understanding-health-care-decisions-end-life](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/understanding-health-care-decisions-end-life)
I'm sorry you're going through this and that you didn't receive the appropriate support in filling out those documents. You can change a DNR or advanced directive at any time. You just need to fill out a new copy of the documents, which are available online, and give them to the healthcare team accordingly. They'll update it and use the most current one (in theory, sometimes it's good to follow up and make sure the change was actually made and it didn't get lost in the shuffle, but you know...). So if you've reconsidered, that's no big deal and (relatively) easily updated. 

It was inappropriate for her doctor to provide these documents without giving you the adequate time to fill them out. These are big decisions! It's hard enough to make them for oneself, but trying to guess what a loved one would want can be very taxing and difficult. It's not just any old form at the doctor's office and it shouldn't have been given to you like that. 

If you've had positive contact with a hospice group at all, they're a resource you can use for any questions you have.  

Idk about outside the US, but in the US you can also go to the website for your state's long term care ombudsmen. At least on ours there's a whole section of resources, including links to state government resources on advanced directives and legal decision making. I believe the Alzheimer's Association also has resources through their website.

Good luck, I'm sure however you proceed will be the best path forward for you
We knew prior to my FIL’s diagnosis that he did not want any life saving measures taken. Giving them food/fluid at the end can extend the journey. If your loved one said no life saving measures, really think about they want. The suffering in the end is hard and I could not imagine having extended that time for him.",2021-04-12 17:21:40,earthsign82,mpnpiq
Alzheimers,Advice about dad,"Hi sorry if this is not right way to ask or [place.](https://place.My)

[My](https://place.My) dad is almost 90 he has severe Alzheimer’s. He was in a care home but proved too much so was sent to hospital. From there he wasnt getting the care needed so was finally sent to a hospital for the elderly.   


my question is due to the fact his symptoms have deteriorated rapidly in last six months, is there a time line to figure out how long he has left? He cannot walk or feed himself. He crawls around and doesn’t speak. He is acting more like a baby again. my mum is very worried about him and I know nothing about this disease. 

Could he be like this for months or years? It’s really upsetting her. he doesn’t know anyone and I’m thinking it would be better for all if the unthinkable happened bc how can it get worse than this? She had spent her entire life looking after her family and has never had a break. 

My mum is in a bad way worrying about him, thanks for your advice. NB sorry if this seemed harsh but things have gotten as bad as I could have imagined with this disease.","It's so hard to tell.

Alzheimers,"Beginning stages, looking for advice","This is a long one, so apologies for the wall of text...

 This is something that my bf is going through- his father seems to be forgetting things more often, like how to use his phone and so forth. The forgetfulness has been a going on for some time and I really don't have many details because I haven't spent enough time around him (I have been dating my fb for a year, but covid and his dad being away in a foreign country has prevented me from getting to know him). 

His dad moved back recently to the states, and it seems that my bf's mother (a long time divorced, but still friends with him and she is also a nurse) came across some info while she was helping with his medication that stated that he was in the first stages of dementia. He is a big drinker (not sure if alcoholic?), and doesn't take very good care of himself (type 2 diabetes), and has had covid  recently (but hospitalized for several days). After he came back, he has been falling down a lot lately (big guy, maybe borderline obese? impossible to lift a 250lb six foot man). 

Anyway, my bf is his medical proxy and is worried because his dad is going to leave the country again next week to go back to the tropical country where he was staying before he came back. We have no idea why he came back, but it seemed like he was breaking up with his gf. Anyway, that seems to have resolved and there is talk about marriage... We are worried that he can't take care of himself and will be in that country with a gf who might not really love him, but is looking for other things (she is 40, he is 73)... And she is not a nurse by any means and in no way equipped to properly look after him.

So I guess my question is this- if his father really had been diagnosed with dementia, wouldn't the PCP be obligated in some way to inform the next of kin of this, or the medical proxy? That was never done. His dad doesn't have any plan for this sort of thing happening to him, even though his mother went through something similar. We are completely at a loss as to what should normally happen and have no idea where to turn for help. What if something happens to him and he can't call my bf because he can't work out his phone? What if we can't find him in this foreign country? He still seems of some sound mind to make certain decisions, so getting any kind of injunction over his decisions seems like not at all a possibility and might cause some serious family issues. Does anyone have any ideas as to what to do here? This is a serious conundrum

TL:DR bf dad in beginning stages of dementia (maybe), leaving the country soon to be with golddigger. What to do?"," I can only comment on the disclosure situation in the US, and the foreign country this man lives in may be totally different.  HIPAA prevents doctors from sharing much without the permission of the patient.  So there's no obligation (here, at least) for a doctor to contact next of kin with this type of information.

Your bf has his work cut out for him.  Medical proxy in another country?  wow.  If bf's dad does marry this gf, she will probably take over those roles.  Dad may be alcoholic?  well, well, well.

One option for your bf might be to cut dad loose, telling him that now that he's getting older, it might not be too handy to be the medical proxy in a foreign country.  In any case it would be a LOT more manageable to look after dad if he moved home permanently, which might be something that could be suggested.  Or ask what the plan is with the girlfriend and whether she might be a more logical medical proxy.

You can't be sure the gf is a gold digger so I don't recommend discussing that with dad.  People can and do love and care for elderly people, including those in early decline.  

I sense there's a fair amount of family dysfunction going on here.  My feeling is there's not a lot that can change that, once at least one member is losing their intellect.  It's important that nobody becomes a martyr for this dysfunctional family, so watch your bf's mental health, and don't you get pulled in either.",2021-04-11 20:03:21,cuteleper,mp2lmq
Alzheimers,Saying Goodbye to my Grammy,"I’m saying goodbye to my Grammy today. 
I was her caregiver for a while before I moved out of state, and haven’t seen her since lockdown started a year ago. She was moved to a care facility 6 months ago, and probably had a stroke during surgery a couple weeks ago and has been placed in hospice care now. I was able to come visit for the weekend without my older two kids and brought my 6 month old who she hasn’t met, to see her for what is almost certainly the last time. 
Trying not to have any expectations as she sleeps most all of the day, only awake about 10 minutes at a time every few hours and still largely unresponsive. 
She took such good care of me as a kid, always picked me up from school, took me to dance classes, taught me to sew, made me so many cans of spaghettios, my favorite soup, Rice Krispie treats... Even if she doesn’t remember me or isn’t awake or anything, I still want to say thank you to her for everything. 
This disease sucks and I hate it, but I’m glad to know there are others here that will understand.","Sorry for your loss, even though she’s not physically gone, Alzheimer’s is the long goodbye. So tough. Good on ya for stepping in as a caregiver. May you take some

Alzheimers,Caregiving for my grandmother with Alzheimer's. Help! :(,"My grandmother is 74 and shes been bedridden for the past 10 years due to a variety of illnesses (dysfunctional neurological system, severe osteoarthritis affecting her entire system). We tried a whole bunch of different treatment techniques (allopathy and ayurveda) over several years and it isnt improving infact it seems to be getting worse and doctors have given up hope. 

For the past four years, shes deteriorated considerably showing psychiatric symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and forgetfulness. Most symptoms and an MRI scan indicate Alzheimers disease, including visits to two psychiatrists who prescribed her a range of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and dementia-related medication. 

Caregiving has become very, very difficult. But finding and ""financially-supporting"" caregiving through external means has become even more difficult. And so my mom looks after her mother (my grandmother) now, and shes showing severe sundowning including lack of time orientation and mood swings and worst of all, insomnia. Shes too scared to sleep at night and keeps my mother awake all the time. I cannot find anyone else to caregive for my grandmother. I dont know what to do, because Im running out of patience to deal with my grandmother (she relentlessly calls people around her for minor things and refuses to sleep at night) and I get angry at her for causing my mother such distress. 

Dementia related support in India (specifically Kerala) is very little. Im really tired and just want to end all this. Any help anyone can give me (people in India would be better) would be appreciated. Are there any homes in Kerala that take in bedridden dementia patients?","I'm so sorry you and your family have to deal with this, Alzheimer's is such a nasty, cruel disease. I understand your frustration, but try to remember to not blame your grandmother. If she had the power to choose, I'm sure she would not choose to behave in such a way that would cause so much distress to her loved ones, blame the disease. 

I live in the United States, so I can't be of much help in recommending services, but I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. The only thing I can think of is, do you have access to marijuana or CBD oil? It could help with her insomnia and general mood.
How does your mom feel about it? Are there ways you can alleviate some of her burden or give her more breaks? It's a terrible disease.",2021-04-10 11:05:34,anxrudh,mo6e4i
Alzheimers,Did anyone tried intermittent fasting or something?,"I have read about articles that Alzheimer’s disease is also often called type 3 diabetes because patients with Alzheimer’s disease are likely to have insulin resistant brains. Of course being metabolically diabetic (as in type 2 not type 1) increases the odds of Alzheimer’s as well. 

But has anyone tried to do anything of the sort like changing diet? Like trying to reduce insulin levels, make them go on Keto diets or fast for a whole day? 

Maybe even MCT oils will help if this is true since ketones is a secondary source of energy for the brain if sugar or glucose can’t be used. If your brain can’t get the energy it needs of course it’s only natural it would start dying off but if we can try to get ketones to work then it would at least postpone or stop the progression of the disease. 

There is also the article that some people with Alzheimer’s have 6x the aluminum content in their brains compare to normal people but I doubt there’s anything we can do here.",,2021-04-09 01:15:29,Penis-Envys,mna83v
Alzheimers,Signs I noticed years before my Grandma got her diagnosis,"Years before my Grandma got her diagnosis I noticed some signs. For example, she lost 500 dollars then blamed it on my Mom and said she stole it. She would occasionally forgot to turn the stove off and burned multiple dishes. These are all the warning signs I saw. What did you guys see?","Burnt saucepans - some burnt so badly had to get thrown out. 

 Some bills backed up unpaid, other bills paid double - financial mess.  (to be fair, scamming sister greatly assisted that to happen, & even made it worse)

 Lost ATM card more than a few times (often because the ATM machine ate it cos she'd pressed wrong buttons more than twice).  Lost house key/bag more than a few times.  (again, to be fair, scamming sister kept ""gifting"" her different handbags to use, so mum couldn't remember/recognise her own bag, would often walk off leaving it somewhere)

Many things, I thought were mostly due to scamming sister with horrid mental health issues, it was a bad combi.  I was living overseas / interstate, so would only see snapshots on visits - didn't realise it was as bad as it was.  

Yeh, retrospect..
Dad paid the bills and had an organized filing cabinet for decades. Before his diagnosis, mom discovered that he was just shoving paperwork in there randomly. 

He received an invitation to a high school reunion, went to it, and nobody was there. We’re not sure if he had the wrong address or day. 

Yahtzee was a family tradition. He forgot how to play.
My grampa stopped calling me. We talked on the phone everyday, so that was very weird to me at the time.
Dropped me off at urgent care and then tried to pick me up at a different urgent care 

We went on a trip and she asked 'whose idea it was to do this'. It was hers. 

She thought I was my cousin. She actually spoke about me to the person she thought was her niece. 

She was upset that I didn't invite her to my graduation. I did. We have pictures together from that day. 

All these little things we laughed off as funny flukes and stories. We should've known they were warning signs

Alzheimers,I hate Sundowner's.,"I really do.  She just looked in my face, scream-bellowed twice, and emptied her dinner into the trash.  Then she demanded ""decent food"".  Because a cheeseburger is ""decent"" for a diabetic, and a bowl of homemade, organic, from-scratch Broccoli Beef is ""shit I don't deserve"".   

I hate Sundowner's syndrome.","It probably doesn't help worth squat, but I hope you know you're not alone. As you go through this you will realize you are the strongest person in the world. Sending internet love and hugs.
Hugs.  I feel ya.
So sorry for your experiences. It sounds awful. Not there...yet?
oof.

I would love homemade organic from scratch broccoli beef. Sounds FANTASTIC!
Goodness. You don't deserve it and it's hard not to take it personally. You're the one who doesn't deserve this.
My sympathies. I'm in the same place. More and more of what I cook (and I'm a damn good cook) goes in the trash. I'm trying so hard to not get upset every time she says ""this is horrible"". Mine's diabetic as well. Luckily her food of choice is eggs and I can always whip up an omelette for her...

Hugs to you.
It’s draining on every single level. Sending hugs
Big hug. I hear ya.
You may do already, but involve her as much as possible in the prep and cooking of the food.
And if you can help her to eat better at other times, would a burger or something similar in the evening be such a bad thing? I know you said she has diabetes and that has to be taken into account. But what constitutes a good diet isn't a fixed thing as someone progresses with dementia.
This is my first time talking about this, and i feel pretty much alone at the moment. Recently my father is not feeling well and he refuse going to doctor or anything like that. Ive been searching internet for days to try and figure out what could be his problem and I found out about alzheimer's simptoms (i thought it was alzheimer at first, but few things werent making sense) and than i found out there is sundowners sindrom. It just fits perfectly. 
Im scared and alone and dont know how to act and what to do. 
Just writing this comment here helps me. Its comforting seing you are not alone.",2021-04-08 21:51:17,plotthick,mn6xpc
Alzheimers,Prepping for the Doctor - Need Advice,"My mother (76) has Alzheimers. She still lives in her own home, and my husband, brother, and I are her caregivers. I don't know what ""stage"" she's in as it's so confusing to determine, but she seems to be managing keeping the house clean, bathing, dressing, and feeding herself -- essentially the basics. I have managed her finances and medical care for the last 5 years or so pretty much completely. My brother gets her groceries, my husband tends to the house, and I take care of other things. She's alone most of the time, but she's preferred that for many years now, long before Alz. I could obviously give more about her state right now, and maybe I should since everyone here is so knowledgeable and could give advice, but that's not my focus of this post.

Her current primary physician has been with her for a long time, but to put it simply, his care for her is inadequate. Long story shortened, he ignored all concerns, and it was a neurologist who diagnosed her after being referred for another problem. The neurologist has given her medication and sees us every 6 months or so); the primary doc has pretty much pretended that nothing's different than it ever was. Recently we had more issues with him, and I made an appointment with a new doctor. Mom's not happy with him either, so it was easier to get her to go to a new doc, and this guy is my own and is awesome (the perfect example of what a doctor should be!).

We are seeing the neurologist tomorrow, and the new primary doctor next week. The new doctor has access to all of her medical records already. The advice I'm asking for is this -- what is all of the information I should provide to him? It's so hard to talk about her in front of the doctors, so I want to be as concise as possible and may even detail it all out for him to just read. But I don't know what all I should give. I want him to know what's transpired and what's going on with her now. I want him to help us determine where she's at and how close she might be to needing to move elsewhere. I want him to help us find services that can help us care for her. And so on .... 

What details are going to be important for him to determine where she's at? Any advice and help you can give will be very much appreciated! This community has helped me so much already, so let me take this chance to say THANK YOU!","I faced the same dilemma this January. I wrote up all the examples I had of Dad’s behavior/memory loss and gave it to the nurse to give to the doctor before the appointment. The doctor said it was very helpful. 

The other thing I would do is talk about my dad in the 3rd person. He doesn’t realize I’m talking about him when I do that.

There was an awkward moment when they asked my dad if he stopped driving because someone happened. My dad said, nothing happened and behind his back I nodded my head vigorously to indicate that something in fact had happened. They didn’t need to know the details but I got my point across.
Write a letter to the doctor to be read prior to joining you in the room.   S/he can pull you aside if they need to discuss further.   This gets it out without upsetting the patient.  Part of the illness is inability to see it and it’s truly bothersome to some when they are discussed openly and they have no memory of the event.   I also recorded (with permission) the doctor memory testing my husband as well as the doctor giving him the diagnosis.  I was able to show him these when he became confused about why he received the diagnosis.   It also made it so I wasn’t “the bad guy”.  I was simply following his doctored orders.
Draw  up a concise summary of changes (for the worse) in the past six months.  Such as, got lost in the parking lot; put raw chicken away in the oven and forgot about it; left water running and flooded the kitchen, etc.  Give approximate dates these happened.  (Sometimes it's easier to remember if you center it around holidays, so, ""before Thanksgiving"", ""after Christmas,"" etc.)

Then either email that over to the new doc, or hand it to the nurse at the first visit.  You can also phone ahead and (privately) tell the nurse at that practice that your mother has dementia.

It sounds like your mother is doing great!  So that's nice.  The doctor has to maintain rapport with her, so at times, they might not seem to be confronting odd behaviors.  Also, as time goes by, the doctor will interact with you more than your mom, say as she loses speech or needs a residential change.
I know this post is a few days old, but I wanted to mention that you might find a geriatric care manager to be helpful.  They specialize in the items you are seeking (help to determine where she's at and how close she might be to needing to move elsewhere, help us find services that can help us care for her).",2021-04-08 12:47:44,Steellace,mmvxqf
Alzheimers,"I posted to the wrong thread, so posting here now.",,"I put a GPS device on my moms keyring when she was still somewhat independent. If she left the house it would alert me and track her location. It's great if you are close and could pick her up and take her home. Obviously there will be a time when it won't make sense to use it anymore. Kippy236 is somewhat right, that at some point she won't be able to be left alone. It sounds like she's really early, so it may be awhile. Months, years, etc.

Aside from that, do you have POA paperwork drawn up? Does your mom understand her diagnosis? See if you can get POA paperwork done, it will save you a ton of headache in the future.
GPS tracking gives caregivers a false sense of security. I've seen it personally and had several professionals tell me the same. If you want to prevent something bad from happening she does not need to be left alone. Once a person is diagnosed a change can happen over night. My dad was driving fine then forgot how to turn on the headlights one evening and was going to drive without them. I put my foot down with my mother and stopped him from driving.

Prevention is key. There have been quite a few seniors with mild dementia go missing in my area. Several were found but a few were located too late.",2021-04-07 21:21:08,wsupton,mmgtgk
Alzheimers,Visual audiobooks?,"My dad used to be a voracious reader but his Alzheimers has taken away that ability. I am looking into audio books for him already, but he’s also got bad hearing and of course no focus. I was thinking, though, that if there was anything like an audio book that also had a simple visual component that might be something he would really enjoy. (I know- I’m describing a movie, but movies just move too fast for him to follow.) Has anyone ever seen such a thing?  Thanks in advance for any ideas.","I dunno if it can keep his attention but theres digital childrens books and comics that are ""read"" outloud now. The childrens books are kind of slow moving but they are read and presented in a way meant to keep attention. I haven't tried any digital audio comics yet. 

Theres digital comics you can try for free with a library card: 
https://www.comicsbeat.com/marvel-audiobooks-dreamscape-media/?amp=1

Alternatively theres a lot of you tube videos of people (regular and celebrities) reading books, especially childrens books. You could just google ""youtube reading"" or search you tube.

 You could possibly try radio dramas.. I know you said its hard to keep attention but they can be a lot more engaging than reading a book. There was ""Seeing ear theater"" from before: https://www.sffaudio.com/seeing-ear-theatre/ they were free, and this link lists them free, but there are also places that will have you pay for them. 

Also theres podcasts that share old time radio dramas too if you search. Production values vary. 

Good luck.
My mother used to go through about a book a week.  A couple years after her diagnosis, she had absolutely no interest in reading and I also tried audiobooks as well. It was just frustrating for her because she had no memory of previous chapters or characters.  She doesn’t even like seeing new movies because it’s so hard for her to keep track of what’s going on.  If I need to keep her occupied for 90 minutes, I have to choose a movie she’s already familiar with and she’s perfectly fine with seeing the same movie over and over, fortunately
Ken Burns or David Attenborough documentaries?
Oh! The radio drama ""Bradbury 13"" is amazing. You can find it on YouTube or download it. It's thirteen of Ray Bradbury's short stories that have dramatized for radio in the 60s. I absolutely love them and I'm sure your father would too. My favorite story is ""The Ravine"". Google Bradbury 13 and you'll find it :)

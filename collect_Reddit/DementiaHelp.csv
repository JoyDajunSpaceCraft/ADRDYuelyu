,Free Skills Training for Family Caregivers of Dementia - Online Resource,"Hi everyone.

I'm part of a team of health researchers and innovators partnered with a Canadian healthcare university hospital.

We've created a platform that provides skills based training for families managing dementia at home. **The platform is free to use.**

We have training on how to help shower your loved one, or how to manage troubling behaviour. All of our content is gamified so the more you learn, the more rewards you can get to redeem for products in our store. Our solution is always being improved and we hope this helps as many people as possible.

It's free for families. Check it out here: [http://trial.trualta.com/login](http://trial.trualta.com/login)

Thanks for your time :)",,2018-10-24 00:41:52,9qwnnz
,"[Advice] we just found out my dad has early onset dementia and Alzheimer's. I'm looking for advice on what I could possibly expect, ideas to help keep his brain stimulated, and any other stories or support you have.","We found out Tuesday (10/2) what's going on after a lot of testing. He's been acting more and more erratic and out of control the past few months, can't remember anything that's not written down, can't follow a conversation, and is having bad almost temper-tantrum like episodes (he was mad my boyfriend's laundry was in the wash when wanted to use it so he pounded his fist on the lid until there was a dent - 10 minutes later he had zero recollection of doing it or being mad). The brain scans show his brain's blood vessels are considerably shrunken.
He has alcohol induced dementia (there are 3 stages ages he's in stage 2) with early onset rapid advancing Alzheimer's. He was fine at the start of the year and the doctor is really concerned at the speed of his decline. She said he's done in 9 months what most people do over the course of 5-6 years. He's had to stop his job today and he hates that. The absolute worst of it is how scared he is about the whole thing. It breaks my heart to see him cry. 

A little back story: 2 years ago my mom got really sick (dead for a total 17 minutes on the table from 3 crashes sick) and asked my boyfriend and I to move in with her since my personal health wasn't great at the moment either. So she got a house big enough for all of us, we all chip in with everything and now everybody has support too - since then she's had two more episodes that would have resulted in death if she lived alone. My dad also moved in when we moved - the kicker there is my parents had been divorced for 15 years at that point, but my dad was really struggling to control his bipolar disorder and his paranoid schizophrenia (he takes all his meds like he's supposed to) and live on his own. My mom still loves him even if she doesn't want to be married to him so she took him in. Add in our 6 cats, 3 dogs, and 1 lizard our house is full but also full of love and support and equal contribution to the household upkeep. This might be too much to add. I just wanted to paint the whole picture of his situation and I'm a little frazzled.

Thanks in advance for your help and advice. ",,2018-10-04 02:46:05,9l9ira
,What Happens to Aging Single Boomers who get Dementia?,"Im in my 50s. Have a bunch of risk factors. Am socially isolated and work a shit job to pay the rent. None of my healthcare providers takes my concern about developing dementia seriously. Have requested testing for MCI; my requests get shoved aside.

Im already having serious brain fog. All this anxiety is, of course, no help--makes it worse. Unsure if the antidepressants Ive been on for 30 years do anything at all.

Since I have few ""friends"", whatever that is, and am falling under the local healthcare radar, what tends ti happen to folks like me whi live alone, are poor, and develop dementia? I can find no reading material on this topic.",,2018-08-14 00:41:45,975gbe

,UK private healthcare coverage for Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD),"Hoping to find someone who has gone through a similar issue...

My mother has been diagnosed with FTD at the age of 57. She has been covered by Bupa for over 30 years with no major issues during that time. 

6 months ago when we were given the diagnosis, Bupa were quick to point out that they do not cover. 

Considering this is a rare dementia that we are dealing with, and we have no family history of dementia, this decision seems harsh and unfair. 

I wanted to see if anyone within the Reddit community has been through the same issue, or if possibly there’s another way through this? Would it still be worth being covered by Bupa after being given a prognosis of 5 years?

,"AMA Announcment: Judy Cornish, Sunday 19th, 11 a.m. EST –11 am Monday the 20th","
Hi, 
My name is Judy Cornish. I’d like to share something we’ve discovered at DAWN; there is very good news for families with someone experiencing dementia—that people with dementia can live happily and safely when we support their intuitive thought skills and experiential selves.  We’ve found that when we focus on and support the abilities rather than disabilities of dementia, our clients are happier and their families can postpone costly long-term care. 
I’m an elder law attorney who became involved with dementia. I’ve spent the past six years working with people with dementia, most of whom live in their own homes. I began to see a pattern in their functioning that medical science does not pick up: they were losing rational thought but not intuitive thought, and losing their remembering selves but not their experiential selves. 
I’ve written a book outlining my findings, which will be available on Amazon this spring. We’re trying to get the word out to families so that more people with dementia will be cared for in ways that support their autonomy and dignity, and more families will be able to avoid being bankrupted by institutional care. 
I’m hoping to take part in your AMA program.

Best regards,
Judy Cornish

,Cracker Barrel Has Humiliated my Grandfather,"It wasn't cool when Cracker Barrel in Ooltewah, TN kicked my 80-year old grandfather out when he got confused, sat himself at the 2-top he ALWAYS sat in, and then when confronted, got heated and even more confused. He shouldn't have been heated (and I'm sure he said some nasty things), but he has DEMENTIA. Since then, my mom has brought him back in that location, smoothed things over, and begged for the ""ban"" to be lifted. So, you can imagine my surprise and humiliation when, as we were being seated, a manager approached us and kicked us out. I tried to explain that he had been in since the ""incident"", but he cut me off and, with multiple people behind him (like we were going to pick a fight), ESCORTED us with his ""bouncers"" to the front to see ourselves out. I am mortified and beyond furious and feel like my grandfather is being discriminated against due to his illness, which is known to cause confusion and aggravation. He's 80 and feeble. He can't punch anyone, he can't flip tables, and he sure can't even remember the incident. You need to learn compassion and respect and get your stories straight. I purposefully chose to take time on my Friday night to eat with my grandfather to eat there, and to be treated with such little dignity, and to watch my grandfather's confusion is sickening and disheartening. I will never eat in another Cracker Barrel again after this disgusting display of ridiculousness.
It has been confirmed by numerous family members that my grandfather has eaten at this location since this incident. My mother apologized on his behalf and made sure the staff knew he had dementia and also promised someone would always escort him to the restaurant. I want answers as to why my grandfather was targeted and kicked out!!! The hostess said the manager on duty was named Kevin.",,2017-02-11 10:23:57,5tfe5m
,How can I help my mother and others like her?,"My 84 year old mother is in the beginning to mid stages of dementia. She refuses all help, believes she is married again (delusional), hates her children (though that's nothing new). The state of Michigan has intervened several times with her but their hands are tied as well. She has a court appointed medical guardian though that is not going well either. I just want to talk about options, ideas to help her, and one other thing - I don't care that she hates us all; I am just sick with worry about this elderly vulnerable woman. Just need to talk.",,2014-12-05 01:28:58,2ocbz8

Dementia,Ketosis and Neurodegeneration,"Do any of you have thoughts on the effects of ketosis on Alzheimer's treatment or prevention? From what I have researched and grown to understand, a ketogenic diet is best for treating any disease. A ketogenic carnivore diet is even better because it rids our plates of phytotoxic plant matter, but that is beside the point. Ketosis heals.

Ketone body Beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibits NLRP3 Inflammasome (Youm et al., [2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3804)), which “has been linked with several inflammatory disorders, which include cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.” (Kelley et al., [2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6651423/))

Dementia,Bathing / Changing Clothes,"My wife (69F) has Alzheimer’s disease.  Her short-term memory is almost totally shot.  She also does not remember that I am her husband.  Fortunately, she seems to mostly like/tolerate me.

Complicating things right now is that we are isolating because both of us have tested positive for COVID.  So, the companions we have hired for her (3 days/week) cannot come, the home health care aides we just arranged cannot start, and my daughter and daughter-in-law are staying away to keep themselves healthy.

My daughter previously has taken care of getting my wife to shower and to put on clean clothes.  We have given up on daily bathing, and would be satisfied with every other or every third day.  Yesterday, I persuaded my wife to go to the bathroom to shower, but she came out half an hour later with dry hair and wearing the same clothes.  I found the clean clothes I had set out folded on her bed.  This morning, she apparently showered, but had changed only her pants.  Since she had been wearing the same shirt for at least two days, including sleeping in it, I asked her to change into a different shirt so I could wash the one she had been wearing.  I leave her in her bedroom, and she emerges five minutes later wearing the same dirty shirt.  This happened, with minor variations, five more times.  Finally, she became exasperated with me asking her once again, and she took off the dirty shirt while I was still in the room and finally put the clean shirt on.

Even after we have the home health care aides, I will have the responsibility of making sure she is bathed and dressed three days a week.  I’m going to ask the aides to be hardasses, and to move heaven and earth of the days they are there to make sure my wife is bathed and dressed in clean clothes.  But I’m pretty sure there will be days when it falls to me.

Anyone have strategies that they have found to work on this issue?","My father is in memory care (76) and he refuses to bathe. At this point, we have to force him (hold him down) to bathe, and I don't like to traumatize him. For my dad, his memory is so short that he forgets what he is doing. A bath is multiple steps. Take off your shirt, take off your pants, take off your shoes, take off your underwear, turn on the water, soap their body, wash their hair, etc. My dad would forget what he is doing when left alone and needed constant prompting (not that it worked regularly). The nursing home tried the following methods, and none of them worked for us, but maybe it will work for your LO? 

1. Build a bathtime routine similar to a bedtime routine for a child. Use trigger words like ""Let's go bathe now"", light candles, set up their shower at the right temperature, layout their favorite lotions/soaps, etc. Make it a zen thing. 
2. Medication. Medicate your LO to be compliant and let you do it for them. Not ideal, but it makes it a lot less messy. 
3. Walk them into the bathroom and let them set up the temperature. Do not leave them unattended. 

Ultimately, whatever method you try, be aware that it will only work for a short period of time. As your LO works through the disease, methods that work one day will suddenly stop working the next.
Another thing that might work if your wife is still coherent enough is to give her 2 options of clothing to choose from especially if she might have a favorite. You could say this outfit she picked out will look nice or great on her but 1st we have to clean up a bit. Maybe cover her in a plush robe to keep her warm and feeling moderate or less exposed as you wipe her down. If its possible keep her distracted with soft music in the background or happy upbeat conversation. Anything that makes the experience a positive one for you and her.
Learn to live with less than ideal.

My mom gets a bath twice a week and she hates it.

She says terrible terrible things to the ones bathing her. It's horrible. 

I wish I knew of any tricks.",2022-05-16 17:41:42,BigBlueHouse09,ur6ux3

Anyone have strategies that they have found to work on this issue?","I don't have personal experience with this, but from advice I've seen, and given that you say her short term memory is shot, is that you really need to go through the entire process one step at a time. So don't ask her to shower, ask her to 1) follow you to the bathroom, 2) take off socks, 3) etc.
Full time caregiver to my uncle. I don't do showers or baths with him anymore since he adamantly refuses and doesn't understand. What I do is give him his breakfast and meds first and make sure the room temperature is warm. If he's approachable enough to get him into the bathroom to wipe him down then I let him stay partially dressed while removing one item at a time but I have to work fast cause he gets irritable. It helps to have clothing you can easily remove like I've put my uncle in button up shirts and basketball pants that I can snap off him instantly. I know my situation is different but I hope you find a helpful solution soon cause this is not easy to deal with.
That’s a tough one because as you well know, folks with dementia do NOT like to bathe.  For my late mom, she was terrified of falling before she eventually became wheelchair bound.  Before she moved to assisted living and was mobile, we basically had to sort of “shame” her into showering by telling her that her friends told me she smelled bad.  She still cared enough what her friends thought at that point and she would finally shower but we had to hover outside the shower to make sure she did it. When she moved to Assisted Living, I don’t think her place had the water warm enough to her liking (probably a house rule to prevent accidental burns) so she hated her showers even more.  Ultimately we had to get a shower chair (one with wheels and an opening for her privates, kind of like a toilet seat), available on Amazon.  I think it helped her feel stable because she was seated and she was less combative.  Maybe a CNA or other folks can chime in with ideas.  Good luck.
It’s extremely difficult and I know I have an easier time getting my mom bathed and changed than my dad does. Most of the time she does not like him (especially if he is telling her what to do), yet simultaneously wants his constant attention. Don’t feel bad that your daughters struggle less. I think it is easier (although still unbelievably difficult) for daughters to get compliance. 

What I do is say everything, no matter how many times I repeat myself, like it is the first time, it is a novel idea, and we are doing it together and we are happy about it. Even if she tells me to fuck off, I reply by saying “oh okay, I’ll help you with your socks, why don’t you sit on the toilet so I can help you! I love you!” Kiss on the cheek. Inside I’m losing my mind but if I lose my temper, even the tiniest bit, all hope is lost of getting anything done. I also use lots of nonverbal cues. So if I want her to sit down I pat the seat. If I want her to rinse her mouth I hand her a glass of water and I say “okay now swish” and I pretend to swish water in my mouth, then I spit in the sink. If I just hand her the water she will gulp it down with her toothpaste. 

Do not leave the room and expect her to do anything. She doesn’t even remember you asked. If she is like my mom, she probably feels some shame that you are asking her to undress. Stay in the room but turn around. Try not to make eye contact or look too directly when she undresses. 

If you’re just changing, try to let her keep as much clothing on as possible. If she wears a bra it’s a bit more complicated but I have a routine for that too that I would be happy to share, just let me know. I try to stick to this order:

- shirt off, have the other one in your hand so you’re doing a “trade” not taking her shirt, turn around if possible to give her privacy 
- help her put the new shirt on, present the arm holes to her so she doesn’t struggle too much. Make everything as easy as possible for her so she doesn’t get as frustrated as quickly. 
- Have her sit. Ask her to take her shoes off but be ready to guide them off her feet. Leave the socks on. 
- ask her to stand. Tell her “we’re going to change your pants” whatever you do do not phrase it as “take off your pants”
- at this point you may have to say “underwear too.” If she hesitates I say “you have new ones, let’s put on the new ones” and show them to her. It’s difficult at this point but you can’t hand her the new ones until she takes off the old ones. This goes for all clothing because she will put them on in top of eachother. 
- sometimes my mom struggles to figure out how to step out of her pants. Be prepared to tell her to sit and stand as much as you need to to make the process as smooth as possible. Anticipate what she needs to do so she never has to feel the frustration of not knowing what to do. 
- hand her the underwear in the correct direction as quickly as possible, help her get her feet in if necessary. Same with the pants. 
- change the socks last. I do this for a few reasons. First keeping the socks on makes her feel less naked, second it’s the easiest thing to do without her cooperation, so if she’s totally fed up with me at this point I can usually just change them while she sits, and if not she doesn’t absolutely have to wear socks. 

Through all of this, be as happy and warm as possible. She, will forget what you just asked, but she won’t forget her frustration or your anger as quickly. So it will only get harder if she knows your mad. Most of my dad’s difficulties come from him reacting to her combativeness by saying things like “why are you doing that I’m trying to help you”. 

This may be more intense than what your wife needs at the moment. I think my mother is further along than your wife is, so you can adapt it as necessary. She may not need physical help, but she needs prompting. 

For showers, pick the time when she is least tired and happiest with you. It won’t be as easy as dressing because she obviously has to be naked for that. Just remember (if she’s embarrassed to be naked in front of you) minimal eye contact, turn around whenever possible so she feels some sense of privacy. Stay on the other side of the shower curtain as much as possible. Hand her the correct products for the correct things. For example: squeeze shampoo into her hand and say “put this on your head” and then touch your own head. Then tell her to rub it in, then tell her to rinse, etc. Never give more than one instruction at a time. Have a robe or towel ready to cover herself. 

I hope this helps. When I want to explode I close my eyes and pretend like I’m auditioning for an acting role as a loving 50’s housewife caring for two young children in a cereal commercial or something. Really it’s a battle and this is my strategy for winning the battle. Good luck and I’m so sorry you’re going through this ❤️",2022-05-16 17:41:42,BigBlueHouse09,ur6ux2
Dementia,Advice for Mother's Caretaking,"My mother was just diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimer's recently. Her symptoms are forgetting dates, repeating stories, etc. She needs help with meal prep, but otherwise is okay on her own. My father passed away many years ago and my sister and I live close by but she has been living alone.

We realized she can't live alone any longer, and my sister tried keeping her at her house a few times for extended periods but she has outbursts and demands to be taken back to her house. She refuses to stay more than one night. So we decided to keep her in her home and brought a live-in caregiver thinking she would be happier. The caregiver is nice and trustworthy. She has been staying with my mom for almost a month now. 

The problem is my mother complains about her all the time, asking her to leave, and demands to live alone. The caregiver leaves on weekends, and my sister and I stay with her and she has episodes of crying and yelling at us for bringing this lady into her house.

We aren't sure what to do, we want her to be happy and live out her life without so much stress. Yet she won't live with my sister, and she doesn't want anyone at her house. She's also said to us previously that she would NEVER go to any kind of senior care.

We are running out of options and not sure what to do at this point. Anyone have any advice?","I would bring this up with your mother's doctor.   One of the hardest things about dementia is there is no perfect answer to a particular problem.   Your mom can't stay alone,  but it's too soon for memory care, but she doesn't want a caregiver in the house.  You need to keep your mom supervised and safe- again, I would bring this up with your mom's doctor.    My mom needed medication to better handle the unwelcome and yet necessary changes to her life.  She wasn't doped up, but an antidepressant and some calming medications have made her a lot happier- no more shouting and raging and less stressed.
Agree on seeing about meds. My Grandma is on a low dose once a day of Citalopram. It made huge improvements to her mood. We are multigenerational in our house with me (granddaughter) as the main caregiver. She threatened to throw me out. Would hit me. Cry. Scream. Tell me she hated me. The works. The meds have drastically improved her emotional stability. She still occasionally gets upset but it is like once a month and at a fraction of the intensity of her previous outburst. Things still upset her, like when she is convinced we are keeping her from going somewhere but it has helped.
I also agree with meds. My dad (76) has similar behavior to your mom, and it got worst once we placed him in memory care. Meds take time, especially when dementia/alz is so personal and different. So far, doctors have tried anti-depression meds, anti-anxiety meds, pain meds, and anti-psychotic meds. Certain drugs will trigger paranoia, and others aren't a good fit because they make your parent a zombie. It will take months to find the right mix, but medication is the only way to ensure compliance. Additionally, see a geriatric psychiatrist. My PCP was essentially useless when it came to medication management and knowing which meds would be a good fit.

Dementia,Spoiled Food?,"Hey all,

My mom has started keeping spoiled food and she yells at me and has a fit when I tell her I'm throwing it out. She has been drinking milk that went sour on 5/9 according to the label (and smell, obviously)...I told her it was expired and she said no it isn't, I just opened it today (5/16) so I showed her the label as said ""yes it is, you're drinking spoiled milk"" and then dumped it out. Clearly this wasn't the best tactic on my part and I feel guilty but I don't want her getting sick. She got mad and went back to the TV.

Would it cause her more distress if I threw things out without her knowledge? I want to keep her in the loop because she is semi-independent but I've been working nights and even though I pay a CNA to come a couple times a week to just spend time with her, I'm worried she may eat something moldy eventually if I'm not there. The CNA says in her experience elderly people tend to keep old food ""just in case"".

Another issue is that she will make a dish one day, forget she did, eat something else, then I'll find her cooking that and dish again the next day. I tell her ""you just made that yesterday, why are you making it again"" and she'll just say ""no I didn't"" so then I show her the container from the fridge and she gets frustrated and says ""I never made that"". Again, poor tactics on my end but I don't know how else to show her. Plus it's a massive waste of food.

I know it's my responsibility to monitor this stuff but I need the extra money as a financial stop gap measure until I get back into my professional career. The food waste is one thing, but her getting food poisoning is worse. I know as her primary caretaker I should be on top of this better, and I have been but with this job it's harder. 

Have any of you experienced this food issue?","I regularly clean out my mom's fridge without telling her. To her, everything is ""still good"" even if it's a yogurt that expired months ago or whatever. If your mom is making the same meals over and over and not remembering, I think chances are good that she won't realize if you threw stuff out. Maybe start with the most dangerous stuff first, and see if she realizes? 

Trying to rationalize with a person who has dementia about whatever wrong thing they believe won't end well for either party unfortunately. It sucks when we're just trying to help and keep the person healthy and it upsets them, just making the whole job harder. You should probably let go of this idea that she can participate in safety decisions. I know how unnatural it feels to start having to parent your parent. :-(

I hope the CNA is around while she's cooking? If she's forgetting whole meals I'd be worried about her leaving burners on, leaving food out too long etc. :-\ Good luck.
Yep,  my mom would drink spoiled milk and brown bananas with fruit flies buzzing about.   ""It's still good!"" she would protest.   Dementia distorts perceptions of what is safe to eat.    Expiration labels might not be understood anymore.   If dementia has destroyed the sense of smell.  then the sniff test to see if something has gone off is impossible to do.

I like the word ""nevertheless"".   Your mom is screaming at you that the food is no good?  ""I understand you are mad but nevertheless we are throwing out this unsafe food.""  It's weird to parent a parent but you sometimes just have to power through on non-negotiable issues.   I would try and toss stuff out when my mom wasn't looking.

Oddly, as she advanced in dementia, she decided any foods that were opened were bad or unsafe.  Even a fresh bag of cookies I bring by to memory care is rejected after she's had a few of them and then sees the package 10 minutes later.  ""Those cookies are  old, I have no idea where they came from.""
I don't know how to solve the problem, but offer the thought that it's a very important one. My father at 96 had a variety of physical issues centering on the GI tract, intake and elimination. He lived 1000+ miles away. After mom died, I took on a commuter lifestyle to keep an eye on him in (semi)independent living facility (lots of aids and helpers, but not 24/7 hawk-eyed supervision).

As a civil engineer, he had always been fussy to a fault over safety issues. But the kitchen (even microwave, toaster) were a foreign country to him. Brainfog made him even more a stranger in a strange land.

I'm convinced he left meat lying around for a week+ in the fridge, ate it, got ugly digestive results, skipped a scheduled medical treatment because he felt lousy that day, and that was the start of a cascade of health problems that led to his passing. 

His passing wasn't a direct result of bad food, but he had little physical resilience by that point, and many other health issues waiting to pounce. Each issue would set off another issue, or treatment for one issue would set off another issue. Basically like lighting one tiny cherry bomb while standing in a fireworks shed.
I'm 33, parenting my dad (76). It does suck, and as someone with no children, it is really hard. I have had to learn that no means no. I throw everything without him looking. If it's when he is awake, I distract him and then throw things away. At one point, he thawed chicken in the fridge and left it there. He literally could not smell that it went bad. You may have to reduce the amount of food stocked in the fridge to avoid the waste, and throw away things in the fridge without her knowledge. Depending on how far dementia has progressed, she may not even remember that the fridge used to have more food. 

Lastly, it may be time to turn off the stove. My dad survived on sandwiches until I could afford to have him placed in memory care. He left the stove on one too many times that it was no longer safe.
Throw it out and replace everything fresh. Clean as she is unaware, or distracted. 
Don't ever be forceful, she feels resistance more then ever. Your resistance will make her irritable. She doesn't want to be losing so much control. Make her feel involved but with simple minded things. And laugh together as often as possible.",2022-05-16 15:15:24,NinjaGrizzlyBear,ur3m63
Dementia,Technology struggles,"My mom is mid-stage, living independently in a community but later today we have a meeting to start her on some assisted living services.  My mother used to be an ace with computers and phones and now has just enough knowledge to keep on breaking her email login.  (We told her the bank app doesn't work on her older phone and she calls me for balance information).  I fix it and tell her (over and over but you know how that goes, sadly) don't change the password!  I have my email and phone number as the recovery info and I have fixed email and other various logins many many many times.  

Just got her email fixed, again, and then Saturday--I got the message that the password had changed.  Now today, I've gotten several phone calls and emails with a google code.  I know my mom is extremely frustrated with her email, and is sitting there on her phone, (she can no longer navigate a computer) trying and trying to fix it...it's heartbreaking.  But I just can't fix it anymore only to have it locked up over and over when she changes the password, and then promptly forgets the new pasword.  She even forgets she's changing the password and will absolutely deny she changed it (I have the emails stating she did).  I do know for sure she isn't being hacked (over and over and over and over....)  

How do I handle this?  I can't tell her what she's doing, it will only hurt her feelings terribly and then she will forget the discussion, and will change the password again.  If I just ignore her requests to fix her email, she won't understand because I have always swooped in and fixed everything--and now I won't?  She doesn't remember that I have to keep fixing her logins, either, and so won't understand my crazy level of frustration with the situation.  Unfortunately, she hasn't forgotten that she wants email, even though she doesn't use email for anything anymore.  THis is SO HARD.","It's bad from an infosec point of view but we ended up writing stuff down, first in a notebook, then on sticky notes near the computer. Lots of autocomplete passwords so there's less friction getting into somewhere. That gave us a year or so, but has stopped working entirely now, and I have to work out how to maintain things without constantly being there in person or looking like I've stolen the computer.
Can you set it up so she stays logged in? I know my email on my phone keeps me logged in at all times. With other apps she may be able to use Face ID if she has an iPhone. My moms iPad is all set up to keep her logged in. Before that we had the same struggles you are describing, and she would always say one of us (my brother or I) broke her iPad.
Delete the email app?  Give her something else (some other app) so that she can ""do something"" on the phone?
You are living my nightmare..................my husband has changed his Apple ID so many times my head exploded.  His ID is linked to a couple of other things and I review all his gmail so know when he changes it.  Mind you, he writes down the new password but when he goes to use it again he inputs it incorrectly.  So, I made a rule that when he gets a pop up about inputting the Apple ID he is to come to me............well, he has memory loss so he never remembers.  He has been totally locked out and I have to fix it but I have totally given up trying to fix this with him. He just doesn't remember anything and nothing I can do about it.  It is SO frustrating.  One week it was EVERY DAY!
Check out the various Accessibility and Child Protection filters that are available in your OS.

You can, for the time being, limit her ability to visit specific pages (like the Password Reset page), and auto-save passwords for her on her phone.

But you already know where this is going ... she soon will not be able to operate he technology at all.

My dad is sadly at this point now... he loved his Excel and email, but even making a call on anything other than a landline is just baffling to him. He can't even figure out which button is the power button on the TV remote.

She is frustrated. And she doesn't have the cognitive ability - and memory - to adapt and learn how to use the tools, anymore. Those abilities are not going to come back. This is her independence and capabilities disappearing before her eyes, and she knows it. That is both terrifying and pisses her off.

If there is anything else you can focus her interest on, that will help. Picture puzzles. Knitting. Scrapbooking. Find something she can still do, that takes focus and time, and it will help ease her off the technology...
Would a password manager help e.g. LastPass? It can then auto-complete details if you don't want to keep her logged in. Then it's just one password she needs to remember or that has to be written down. It's worse to reuse passwords than to have a secure password in a home with limited access. This obviously is more risky if there are lots of carers entering the home. I also have TeamViewer for remote access as explaining is an absolute nightmare.
A couple months back my LO had trouble with her PIN number, which I couldn't help with because I didn't know it. We talked about what would be easy to remember but not terrible infosec practice and decided on something. I took her to the bank to fix it (a fair drive away because the local branch had inconvenient hours), had a few practice runs and thought it was all sorted. Then a couple weeks later she tells me she had trouble with her PIN again but popped over to the local branch on her own and they sorted it out for her, and gave her a 7 digit number that she can't remember. 

After cursing the heavens for a while I got through to the bank, who reassured me that 7 digit PIN numbers weren't a thing, and in the end she hadn't successfully changed it. She gets it right maybe 30% of the time now. Time to activate the power of attorney.
Is she able to use her computer/smartphone in any meaningful way? If not, it's probably time to take them away. 

Tell her that you need to remove the devices and take them to the tech shop to be 'fixed', on account of this whole 'broken login' thing. Then, when she asks when she's getting her stuff back, stall her. Tell her they're trying to repair the items, but they need a new computer chip, there's a shortage, supply chain issues, etc. Just stall her along until she stops fixating on the email thing.

I know it doesn't feel good to lie about this stuff, but sometimes it has to be done. If she's not really able to use tech anymore and it's only causing her confusion/frustration, then it's time for the tech to go. Get her a dumbphone, if necessary, or a landline phone. Something that does nothing but phone calls. Tell her it's her 'temporary phone' until the repairs are done. 

I'm sorry. I know how hard this is and how much it sucks. I wish you the best!
Is she accessing her email from an app or a browser?

I have a family member who can't manage  his passwords.   He accesses everything from his computer via a browser.  Before I turned off the browser's setting to auto saves passwords,  I made sure his password for his email was autosaved.  Yes,  he struggles with all the other websites that require a password but at least he can read his email without an issue.",2022-05-16 14:35:26,saxtonferris,ur2qf2
Dementia,A New Major Setback :(,It took me 5 years of trying to convince my mom that she needs to see a doctor for her memory stuff. Long story short I was finally able to take her to a neurologist 2 weeks ago and in the appointment she  was so insulted by the written 5 minute memory test that by the end she was angrily stating how absurd it was that the doctor was testing her on things that she isn't using in her daily life and that it was ridiculous (she wasn't able to complete the test). She expressed to me today how upset that test made her and at the appointment the doctor referred her to get neuropsychology testing which I've heard is around 4 hours long (which it seems like my mom will definitely not sit though). I don't know what to do now. I don't know what the next steps to take are. I think I will be able to get her to do the MRI's MAYBE but a terrible geriatric provider earlier in the year told us she might only have a year left to live based off of no evidence or rigorous testing after the first visit. I really wanted a second opinion but it doesn't seem like i'm going to get it. If she refuses to take the tests then what should I focus on next besides ensuring that she is safe?,"No, she won't get through the neuro psych exam and it can take over 4 hours.  Does she really need an MRI? Just because a doc wants to do more testing doesn't mean she has to have it done.  A good neuro doc will be able to diagnose her based on what is happening with her.  The benefit of having a diagnosis is medication, some meds work better with different types of dementia.  My husband has been told he has Alzheimers, then Lewy Body Dementia and now Parkinsons Dementia.  He has had 2 neuro psych exams and MRI's. Bottom line is he has dementia. Don't try and force your Mother to do anything she doesn't want to.  I imagine it is quite frightening to know you have dementia and will lose your ability to function over time.  Leave her be right now.  If you have not been to an Elder Attorney do so now so you can have the proper legal documents in place for the future. You have not described what is  happening with her other than some memory stuff nor her current living conditions so hard to give advice.  Just make sure she is capable of taking care of herself:  cooking, driving, bathroom habits etc.  If she is driving, should she be?
The MRI could be to actually diagnose what is going on...my dad has a dementia-like disease that was only diagnosed through an MRI.

When he took the cognitive tests, the results were inconclusive because he could do well on some of the complicated ones.

As for what you have to do, you have to step up and make terribly difficult decisions. Your mom may curse your name and fight you at every step of the way, but it will get to the point where it is a safety issue and you will have to make those decisions to ensure she doesn't hurt herself or anyone else.
I know how it feels to want an “answer” but it sounds like your mom has dementia. I wouldn’t worry about getting more tests done (I focused so much on tests and at the end it cost a lot of money and they still found no treatment for her). I would focus on care now. Are there any meds her doctor can prescribe now? What sort of care plan can be put in place? If she is still driving, talk to her doctor about contacting the state and getting her license revoked. I know it was nice when the state took my moms license so then it wasn’t myself or my dad doing it to her.
I think the medical tests (like MRI) are the most important piece.  The rule-in or rule-out other explanations for the dementia that there might be worthwhile actions for.  For my Mom, these were fine.

The neurologist didn't seem to add much value other than being able to order the medical tests.   (My Mom argued with him about answers for ""Driving Test"" which is a multiple choice test which gives a percentage score on how likely you are to fail a driving test.)

The neuropsychologist didn't really add much value either except for one thing she explained.  Say you have a memory of an event.  Say you lose 50% of that memory of what happened.  Your mind fills in the other 50% as best it can.  And that's how you end up with someone having a much different recollection of an event. 

From year to year visits with neuropsychologist (yes, these are long), we are being told she is getting worse.  We already know this through interactions with her.

My Mom frequently has trouble remembering things for even a few minutes.  This was diagnosed as Mild Cognitive Impairment, not dementia, and they said she wasn't bad enough for any of the dementia medications.  

I don't have an answer.  I think the answer is it just sucks.  And my Mom will go along with whatever we say - to this doctor, to that test, it's just nice to be out and doing something...
Same complaints here, exact same complaints about the tests. Gets very angry because “I have never been good at math and they never taught me how to do math correctly” blah, blah… I found the neuropsych testing quite informative myself as it is important to exclude the possibility of cofounders such as depression as they can have significant overlap. 

I would consider making and attempting to go to these appointments and if she refuses then at least her medical providers will be able to document the refusal and treat her based on the data that they are able to obtain in their limited interactions. This will least get her a diagnosis and may help justify trying certain medications and competency decisions etc down the road.
Why does she need all those tests? Sorry, but a doctor who knows how to deal with dementia patients would find a way to test her in gentle ways that won't upset her. Also, MRI - why?
Do whatever you have to do to get her to the neuropsychologist appointment. Yes, it can be a long appointment. Or it can be a much shorter appointment. I don’t know why, but my husband’s appointment was more like an hour. Maybe that means he didn’t get the full appointment he needed? Maybe it means they could tell pretty quickly what they were dealing with? Maybe lots of things. However, I would not mention the length of the appointment to your mom. Just get her there and let them figure out how to keep her there. If she blows up and storms out, seeing her overreacting may actually help them diagnose her.
We’re in a similar situation with my grandad. He’s not had any of the proper tests because ultimately he’s 93, doesn’t understand why he needs them and wouldn’t cooperate. In his case having the full diagnosis wouldn’t change anything, he’s too far gone after multiple falls for medication to have an effect so we haven’t seen the need to put him through it just to learn something we already knew. Ultimately I guess it’s down to whether you think these tests will have a benefit going forward or not, and unfortunately no one can decide that without knowing your mom.
I'm a little frightened to say, that I'd feel the same way as your mom. I hate tests and I hate trick questions worse.  That said, if all these tests aren't really going to make much of a difference in the end, then maybe it's better to just leave it alone, for your mom's sake.",2022-05-16 01:47:58,skyskiesku,uqotmo
Dementia,I am exhausted.,"I know this isn’t about me its about her, my grandma.

My grandma has lived at home with us my whole life. I’m not in a situation to move out right now and I don’t want the burden left on my mom anyways but I just can’t take it anymore. Shes been at a rehab for two months. She shouldn't come back home but maybe I am being selfish. She has dementia, we didn’t particularly knw until lately. She falls down and breaks her bones. That’s why she is there. I’m sick and tired of taking care of the parent figure that I love and watching my own mom become more sick because of her. My mom is not as well anymore and has health issues, I have health issues ad my grandma is a huge burden with her dementia and she is completely helpless and not independent. Our other relatives don't understand and think she should live at home but they don't know what its like or probably care.

There has been a huge strain in our household because of the stress and it rly falls on my mom and I its not healthy but my mom wants to take her home also because she wants to be home but she NEEDS a nursing home/memory care center. It shouldn’t be up to us to keep her alive and a few hours a day of care at home isn’t enough and not from trained individuals with specific dementia care.

I’m scared for her when she comes home. I’m scared and l feel so selfish of how much stress it causes me and how much of my life it takes away. I don’t think she should be home because I feel she needs 24 hour care at a memory center where they are TRAINED. But no my family thinks my grandma should once again get what she wants and live at home because that’s what she “wants” and home is home. At what cost though?  Its not fair and I don’t mean to sound selfish. I don't think its fair for her to live with us and have people come for how ever many hours they can that we can have with insurance or pay when she should be at a facility. I'm exahusted and i think i am a little upset. Its not a healthy environmet but maybe i am wrong.

I’m so scared I love my grandma more than life and I can’t believe I don’t want here here. It isn’t fair I’m tired of it she needs round the clock care and I don’t want our house to be a sick home we have done it before and it wasn’t right it was just stress. I want my mom to be okay too. she does't understand that dementia is progressive and shouldn't wait till the tail end of it but get optimal help now! I am so scared I want her to be in a facility but it isn’t what I want I can’t believe I don’t want the woman whos lived with me my whole life at home.

&#x200B;

need advice, thoughts, opinions, because while i said i kow this isn't about me i feel so alone.","I don’t know. This sounds rough. 

Maybe tell the family “grandma needs more help than 1 person to help her. She can go to memory care or: uncle jimmy comes to help for at least 8 hours on Mon and Wed, cousin Susie on Tuesday and Thursday, Pat on Friday and Saturday, and we will rotate Sundays.” Or if someone else can take grandma, we can move her to your house.
She should definitely, 100% go to a care home.  You and your mom are the only ones that need to be united on this.  If you make clear to the rehab that you and your mom are not equipped or willing to care for grandma anymore, they will be LEGALLY OBLIGED to discharge her to an appropriate facility.  They cannot discharge her to a home without willing caretakers.

If your family has a problem with this, let them volunteer to take her in.  And see how quickly they scatter.

You are correct that your grandma needs around the clock, professional care, and that you and your mom cannot provide that.  This is not your fault and you don’t need to carry guilt about it.  It is not right for you and your mom to sacrifice your health and your lives just to serve the “wishes” of your grandma.  The situation at home is not healthy for her, and I’m willing to bet she’s not happy either.  

Dementia is a beast and requires full time care by professionals.  Period.
I feel for you and your mom!  I agree with you, and the other commenters here.   Tell the faMiLy that grandma needs to move to their home & they care for her due to your moms & your health issues, and the stage of grandmas progression.   It's usually like that - folk who don't do the work or the heavy lifting dedicating their lives 24/7 to a very difficult task that have a lot to say about which OTHER people should do it.  pppffftt, grrr!

Sure, it's very sad when it gets to that point for people that they really can't expect their family to be able to care for them anymore, that they need to be in care of professional experts at a 24/7 facility.  Sad but inevitable, unless one is lucky enough to spontaneously pop off at home before it gets to that stage.  And our countries, we're lucky we even have those options - many countries don't.  

Can you call dementia or alzheimers org for some counselling about how to help yr mom see that it's really not a good idea for her to bring grandma home?  And how to communicate that to the thick-headed bossy fAmiLy so that they stop guilt-tripping & harassing yr mom about it?   And some counselling for yourself to help you with the guilt feelings.  It's hard to be pragmatic sometimes, isn't it.  So sorry.  Best of luck to you all!
My dad fought cancer for two years, and my family did absolutely everything we could to keep him home. I gave up my life for two years, willingly, to care for him. I could deal with the care, cleaning him, wiping him, appointments, etc, but in the last weeks before death  it got to a point to where it wasn't *medically responsible* to continue in-home health care. He would have constant bleeds that I couldn't stop without proper equipment, and some of his care required a RN to perform. We put him in a hospice facility that was able to keep him comfortable until he passed.

My mom has dementia (she's actually in year 7) and is semi-independent. It is absolutely *exhausting* having gone from dad straight into caring for mom but it's my responsibility as their child. My dad cared for her before but now that he's gone it's different. I can handle it for now but dementia is a whole different beast than cancer...at least my dad was cognitive enough. 

My only advice is, as I said before, assess whether it is *medically* responsible to keep your grandmother at home...And that your family is healthy outside of her. You mentioned your mom is getting ill and you have medical conditions. You can't care for somebody without caring for yourself, it's a injustice to all parties involved. That was what was tough for me, I kept telling myself I could do this alone (literally don't have any family in my city apart from my mom now) but eventually I realized how drained I got from taking care of my dad and how I didn't recharge in between. 

I know I need help and it sounds like you do too...maybe you can get other family members to come take care of her from time to time, since they are the ones adamant about keeping her at home.
This should be a decision made by your mother. It hard on everyone that does this. But as concerned as you are about your mother she feels the same about her mother.",2022-05-16 01:31:38,Throwawayhelpbelly,uqol1v
Dementia,Should I move Mom?,"Hello to the group,

I'm struggling to decide if I should move mom, who has dementia. She's in a full time care facility across the country, doing well, but has very little visitors. I have the opportunity to move her to a facility 10 min from my home. 

I am very worried about what the move will do to her mentally. A 2 hour drive to the airport, a 3 hour flight, and then to a new home, all in one day. I would be traveling with her the entire time and there to help acclimate her to the new place.

Should I move mom to have the extra care from me (her daughter) or am I doing more harm by taking her away from what she knows and trusts, however isolating it can be with very little family close by. Any advice??

Thank you in advance!","I think it's a fantastic idea to move her nearer to you.  With regards to travelling, and whether that would be unsettling, are you in any position to drive?  The journey and process might be easier.
I think you should move her.  It will be a tough journey, but in the long term it will be easier for you to keep an eye on her (and make sure she’s getting proper care, not neglected), especially if she has an emergency like a fall.
It would be beneficial in that they would see you a lot more often, and get away from the more toxic family stuff you mention.

Some are good with a change, if managed correctly...and it seems like you are on a good path to that. It would help to have Dr papers, maybe stating her condition...and maybe consult with a Dr for a way to slightly sedate her prior to the flight and/or a PRN (as needed) that could be given if she freaks out or gets agitated on the flight.

If the place you are moving her to is experienced, they will know she will be a bit ""out if it"" when she first comes, due to adjusting to change. Seeing your familiar face will help a lot. Helping her get introduced to the new place, settled in, and into a good routine will help. But until she adjust, they may have some behaviors on their hands...and she may be a higher fall risk, as she will be confused and want to ""go home"".

I do NOT Know what her room set-up and/or decoration was at her old facility...but maybe have the old facility take some pics, and maybe you could set her new room up, or try to make it as familiar as possible.

The move will have it's positives/negatives...but it sounds like it might be better to come to you. And I am saying this as someone who has worked as a nurse aide for a bit over 20 years. When I first started, I barely saw residents getting visitors. I felt like family dumped them there, and hardly came back. My first resident I had pass away, she had no one come to be with her...I clocked out and stayed until she passed, and then cried my eyes out...I was 17. It is a BIG reason as to why I am always smiling, trying to make them laugh, be silly, etc...because I may be one of the few they see that day. :)

(edited typos)
Getting used to her new surroundings will not take a few days. It will probably take her at least 6 weeks. She's spending most of her time with the other people living in the facility. Family may not visit often, but she's not alone. 

I'd suggest making a pros and cons list. Moving her won't come cheap, health-wise.
Eventually, you will need to be a close to her because the facility will only do so much. A lot falls to family members that they don't really tell you about until you are in it.
Yes, great plan! The travel day will be exhausting & very confusing for her, and she will need time to settle in at her new place, yes, but visiting her often will be a huge upside. Good luck for your journey!
Is she doing well where she is?  I know she has few visitors,  but how is SHE doing?  You might be imagining what she would have wanted when she was healthier, or what you would want if you were in that position.  But those are separate issues.
I think it is worth mentioning that as dementia progresses, she will associate with your visits with the frequency rather than the length or effort involved. it becomes almost like a binary “did they visit” rather than how long. it’s very common to hear patients say “you never visit” when their family spent five hours last Sunday, the last three of which was begging them not to leave. You get more bang for your buck, so to speak,  joining them for lunch, or even just 30 minutes only, multiple times a week
We moved my mom from her home town to my brothers home town. She wasnt really getting the local visits that we hoped for and now my bro and his family are close and she gets more stimulation.  So for us it was a win, but it was definatley a difficult transition.  

I think you`ve given enough reason and thought to the process to realized she will be better off near you.
It sounds like this move is more for you than her. If she’s getting great care now why move her?!would she remember you coming by every day if you did? Mine doesn’t, so i’d pick good care over the abolity to visit everyday and still be blamed for never visiting.
One day of potential discomfort (with you) vs. the rest of her life close to you. Seems to be an easy choice.

Have you presented your mom the opportunity to move closer to you and asked her preference? One of my mom's friends recently moved from one Assisted Living Facility to be closer to her daughter in another State and she has no regrets. She's MUCH happier.
Good luck !
I find that any change in routine is difficult for my elderly cousin who is in assisted living. So the move may cause some confusion for a while. Then she should settle into the new routine. I agree that if possible, she should be closer to you. My cousin is in an amazing facility and very happy. But after spending a day with her, I realize I need to be more vigilant regarding her care. For example, if she complains of aches and pains, their nurse practitioner will just prescribe an extra medication. So I’m going to keep a close eye on that.
In my opinion, definitely move her. She will have an adjustment but try to make it a fun adventure for her. I don't know her level of dementia. My grandpa was childlike, and enjoyed candy, cartoons, and a soft blanket. Maybe have a photo album she can flip thru of good memories you can talk about.",2022-05-15 23:05:47,Azmassage,uqm8eb
Dementia,Early onset,"Hey guys, my mom has had a declining memory for the past couple years, and she’s had difficulty with remembering names of close family. Last week she walked out of the house that she shares with my dad, and he had no idea where she went. To our relief she was at the hospital, either by way of Good Samaritan or ambulance, but safe nonetheless.

The past few months he has been trying to get a neurologist to read her cat scans that have been performed, but the closest appointment they can get is august.

The morning of the excursion she didn’t realize she was home, and was having trouble thinking of my dads name. Since then (when she’s woke up/isn’t tired) she doesn’t have issues with that. 

Anyways, what I am trying to gauge if anyone here has had similar experiences, and how long she has at this point. I know with this disease victory looks different than others, but she is 55. Any thoughts?","So sorry you have to deal with this. 
My mom was officially diagnosed at about age 64/65. She had trouble with coherent conversations and memories. She passed away at about 71. The last couple years, she became completely non-verbal. The disease affects everyone differently. Alz.org has some great resources on stages and what to expect. Depending on when the person is diagnosed, I think they say the average is up to 20 years. 
Stay strong friend 💜It can be a rough road. Take care of yourself and take it day-by-day.
It progresses at different rates with each person, but my dad is in the same boat as your mom. We started noticing memory issues at 53 (!) which was so young that *none* of the medical professionals we talked to took it seriously. They wouldn't even humor us with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. It progressed so gradually that we didn't notice the day-to-day degradation, but over several years he lost the ability to cook, to clean, to wash clothes, to reheat food in the microwave (we've still got a scorch mark from when he tried to microwave a fork)... and, eventually, even take showers or get dressed without help. 

A little over a decade after we first noticed memory problems, and several years after an official diagnosis, he started getting violent with his wife and me. The last time he attacked his wife, we had him put in a home. He's still in his 60s. Physically mostly okay (he can walk and talk without issue, which makes people think he's much better than he is) but his brain is completely scrambled. 

If your mom is having trouble remembering close family, that's a fair ways in. Can she still recognize faces of those people? Does she connect their face with a memory of someone from her past - such as a sibling or aunt or uncle (even if they've passed?) 

When you do get the appointment with the neurologist, tell them *everything you can remember*. Take notes - seriously, that helps. Times and dates. Things that happened that are out of the ordinary. Everybody forgets a name now and again, but if it's frequent, they need to know. 

The first couple psychologists we found were totally useless, but eventually we got a geriatric psychiatrist to sit down with dad long enough to see how bad his situation really was. Be persistent and take lots of notes. A diagnosis can help get your mother medication that can help manage her mood, but, as you probably know, dementia will keep progressing. Best of luck, you're in for a rough ride. Get used to practicing self-care. Don't let dementia destroy or derail your life.
My mom was diagnosed with early-onset at 65. Unfortunately a neurologist can’t do much aside from begin to confirm a diagnosis (this can take up to a year) and perhaps tell you whether it might be frontotemporal (most common for early onset and what my mom has), vascular, Lewy body, or another kind of MCI. My mom’s progression has been fairly slow, but the decline is noticeable. I will say that sticking to a routine and keeping sleep, nutrition, exercise, and low stress makes a huge difference in how she functions day-to-day. I would encourage you to figure out the logistics of the progression of care she will need now, so you don’t have to make decisions from a place of distress or fear. At some point she will need more care than your dad can provide alone, and it’s important to include her in decisions such as moving to an assisted living facility or bringing in help as needed. I also recommend reading “Somebody I Used to Know” by Wendy Mitchell, who has early-onset dementia. It really helped me and my dad understand what my mom was going through.",2022-05-15 22:49:57,Late-Mycologist5136,uqlyde
Dementia,Need some advice with my grandma and seeing,"My grandma has dementia (vascular specifically I think), and while she’s not in the later stages yet, she’s getting there. Just a heads up, I’m sorry if I seem to be a bit blunt talking about this sort of stuff, it’s been a constant factor in my life one way or another so I never really got to learn how learning somebody you love has dementia and having to come to term with it. For me, that was just how some relative were.

Moving onto what I need some advice for, my grandma loves to sew (she learnt how at like 5 and it was her constant hobby), and would do it a bunch when I was younger (I’m currently in my late teens). When I say a bunch, I mean she’d make boxes upon boxes of finished American girl doll outfits, including multiple layers, working pockets, themes, and just generally some of the best sewing I’ve seen to this day. She’d go to craft shows, usually the kind organized by the local Facebook mom group, filled with old grandmas and their reluctant husbands. That sort of stuff. The earliest memories of it I can scrounge up had her as the most social and kind person, who genuinely loved to see and sell her creations.

The issue is, as she’s gotten worse, she hasn’t been able to do this anymore. We’ve found boxes of fabric, cut and ready to be sewn, that she forgets about. It’s a loop, she’ll want to make doll clothes, but once she’s cut out the fabrics, she puts them away and forgets, then repeats that. Plus, I’m not entirely sure if she can still sew at the level she used to be able to, so I don’t know if she just can’t make all those doll clothes anymore.

All of this is just a long lead up (and also a bit of a vent since my family doesn’t much like to talk about my grandmas dementia, like at ALL, which is a different issue entirely) to the actual question. Would it be good if I offered to help her start sewing and selling doll clothes again? It seems like a good idea on the surface, doing something she enjoyed in the past that she can’t do alone now, but I know it’s not that simple. Sometimes doing things like that can stress out people with dementia, and I’m not entirely sure if this would or wouldn’t. She seems to enjoy telling me about and showing me her doll clothes (she has some she never sold, because when I say she made a lot, I mean it), but also the stress of something like this could just upset her more. 
Sorry about the essay, I just want to put as much as I can so it’s more clear on if I should/shouldn’t

TL;DR
Need advice on if it’s a good idea to help my grandma with dementia start sewing again, or if it’ll just cause her more stress","You can try -- use the pieces she's already cut out. Don't expect her to finish the project, though. She may lose focus almost as soon as you start, but she may also enjoy sitting near you while you sew.
I say go for it.  People lose executive function (how to plan the steps of a project) but retain procedural memory (the actions it takes to sew) for a long time.  

Set up her machine or hand-sewing stuff if that's what she used to do.  Pull out the fabric for an easy doll clothes project--just a very basic dress. Use a woven/cotton fabric instead of a knit because that's easier to sew.  

Sit with her and be prepared to be in charge of/remember where the pins, scissors, etc. are.  She might not have enough working memory to remember where she laid the scissors down last, so you be ready to hand them to her. 

She might just enjoy putting patterns on the cloth and cutting them out, too. It doesn't matter whether she can finish a project or not.  The goal is to come up with parts of the project that she still can do and enjoys--makes her life have purpose.  It could even be just sitting down and talking about sewing while you do the sewing.

Quilting could be an even better project.  Easy quilt patterns are straight lines, she should be able to sew straight lines.   I can give you quilt pattern links if you want to try that
One of the things that happens with dementia is that they lose the ability to remember all of the steps involved in a task. Can someone sit with her and describe each step for her? 

She may enjoy sewing simpler projects.",2022-05-15 13:36:46,pugghat,uqb4mp
Dementia,My grandpa doesn’t remember his dog dying and keeps shouting at my grandma for kicking the dog out,"My grandpa (80yo) has Alzheimer’s and recently got disability. The family dog of 11 years recently was euthanized (by recently I mean in March), he was really sick and had tumors all over his body. At first when my grandma told him the dog has passed away he cried a lot but at least accepted it. Now he frequently blames my grandma for kicking the dog out, wants the front doors to be unlocked because he believes that the dog will come back, everytime we’re out somewhere, he says that he needs to go home to feed the dog and take it on a walk. This has impacted my grandma greatly because she gets all the blame for literally anything, he would shout and curse at her, at some times threatening to beat her. We are not putting him in a home, he’s already seen a psychiatrist and is on meds. Is there anything else we can do? I know it’s hard on him, but it breaks my heart to see my grandma suffer from it as they live alone and we don’t have the space to take them in (a two bedroom apartment).","His behaviour unfortunately sounds like it warrants going into a home. This is a huge emotional burden for your grandmother to deal with on a daily basis.
Do you have any photos of the doggo?   Print one out big A4 size, write clearly on it ""Rover in rehab after vet operation, coming home next week"", display it clearly somewhere in the house where he'll see it all day.  Or, if he might handle it, go for the truth, make a memorial photie of Rover - ""RIP Rover March 22 greatly loved & missed"".

So sorry, it's really tough, and sad.   But yeh, it's very very hard on yr grandma to have to be suffering domestic violence & emotional & psychological abuse at her age, from someone who she's spending all her time & emotional & psychological capacity on caring for.   Sounds pretty hellish.  At what point will grandpa go residential, when he starts actually beating her, pushes her over & breaks her hip?   :(

Have you already or can you get some in-home respite care organised, for grandma to have desperately much-needed respite time-off?   If he's always shouting at her blaming her cursing at her threatening her -- just because he has dementia doesn't mean he has free-pass to abuse her.  Doesn't mean she has to just suck it up and take it, that's horrendous.  Poor grandpa, sure, but wow - poor poor grandma.  :(    

Contact dementia org or alzheimers org, get some expert professional experienced counselling on what your local options are, how to best help grandpa & grandma before something really horrific happens.  Best of luck!
If you care about your grandma, you should put him in a home regardless of if you want to or not.  If it's not this, it'll be something else in the future where he will again attack your grandma..  You can't control stuff like this when his disability causes it.  Your grandpa will suffer no matter what you do so your grandma is really the only one you can save and should be your first priority.

If it's for financial reasons you absolutely can't move him, then maybe medication.  Maybe one of those fake dogs.

If it's in the US, Medicaid should cover it.  Contact your aging and stabilizes office to get a social worker to help you.
Could you say the dog is at the vet or someone else’s home? Make a big sign for him that says “Beloved Pooch is at the vets office”. Put one by the doors, by his chair, wherever he is acting out. You can affirm that he has a valid concern- the dog is unsafe, cold, lonely, hungry, and make him feel heard. Try not to argue with him, there is no winning as I’m sure you’ve learned. Hopefully you can ease his hyper fixation with the dog with some redirection.
This may be a long shot.   But you could try one of those robotic pets.  They have dogs and cats.  They usually have to be pretty far along to believe the pet is real.  But it sounds like a terrible situation so it's worth a shot.  I'm sorry you're going through this.
""The dog is at dog camp. He'll be back next week."" If he is at this point, and he is, it's time for white lies. There is no reason to force him to re-live the trauma of the dog dying over and over again.
We always say that the dog is “at the groomer” or “at doggy daycare” or “out for a walk with _____” constantly. “Look! They sent me a picture. Look how much fun she’s having/how cute she looks!!!” And no, she doesn’t remember and asks again a few minutes later. But the key is to manage the emotional state. The dog being in a safe place where she is happy is something that elicits positive emotions rather than negative ones. The knowledge doesn’t stick for more than a few minutes but the emotional states can carry over. So anything that can be done to encourage a calm and happy emotional state, like saying that the dog is safe and happy elsewhere, is valuable.",2022-05-15 11:46:02,MelanieSenpai,uq8t4r
Dementia,so is this dementia?,My granda who is in her 70s (i dont know exactly) was just telling me to come and look at her fish tank because she saw people standing there and she told me that she didn't want to be seen by the people. She said that they had a garage and some construction going on. And she was asking me how far it is from here to home but we are at her house she is also taking some meds for her pain/heart problems/other daily meds. I am respectful when she talks about this stuff but its the first time ive experienced anything like this (im 17 years old turning 18 soon),"The confusion could be caused by a urinary tract infection (very common in the elderly), or the side effects of one of her medications, or it could be dementia.  I would suggest getting her to her doctor as soon as possible to assess her.  If it’s a UTI (urinary tract infection), they can easily treat it with antibiotics.  But try to get her to her doctor or even a clinic today if possible.
My 87 yo mom was seeing men in her bedroom and thought my son had a baby in his room and much, much more plus falling. I thought we were headed for the worst. Turns out she had a UTI! Took her antibiotics and now she's back to the way she was before it all started. So relieved it was a quick fix. She had zero symptoms of a UTI.
Symptoms of Lewy Body dementia include delusions and visual hallucinations. But it’s important to rule out other possible causes like UTI or side effect from pain medication or drug interactions. Good luck, you sound like a kind and sensitive grandchild.
Dementia progresses slowly.  So when someone starts hallucinating overnight, it's usually something medical.  You or your parent can call her doctor and describe what's happening.  It's probably a med side effect or accidentally taking too many pills or a urinary tract infection.  Could also be dehyration--if it's been really hot or if your grandma had diarrhea.   Those are all curable.  Dr. might also want to test her for vitamin deficiencies.    


Does Grandma have a pill container that holds all her pills?

Dementia,I am scared.,"My mother 56 year old, has started showing early signs of dementia. It might be becquse she is in a lot of stress due to poor living conditions and even worse family condition. My father is completely careless. The marriage was arranged. They never talk to each other unless some messag has to be conveyed. These latest headphone just made him even worse. My mom would tell something he wouldn't even acknowledge it, she would get frustrated and leave.

EPISODES
1. She usually calls people with wrong names, it wasn't a big concern at that time

2. She constantly struggles to cook especially the planning aspect of it. She would constantly complain to me that she has done nothing much, yet the time is running fast.

3. Recently I was on my room, she randomly came in and switched off the lights. When questioned, she said, she thought I had left, said that she was absent minded 

4. She sometimes walks close to me with dress hiked exposing knee, when she comes and talks to me.

I spoke to one of my family nurse to whom we tend to in case of emergency. (Her own mother has dementia) she told me that it may be due to lack of sodium. Then later diverted the topic saying she might just be under too much stress due the family conditions. 

Additionally my mother has knee problems which is being treated by physiotherapy. If not treatable she would have to undergo surgery which would involve full body anesthesia, I've heard that it only accelerates dementia. She also has varicose veins in knee (dont know if it helps), She is relatively very young, and I don't really know whether it really is dementia.

Any advice on how to prepare my mind for upcoming events would be appreciated. I am hoping it this might just not be related to dementia.","Get her tested for UTI. Dementia like symptoms are often the result of a undiagnosed UTI.
 From what you are saying  , it could be depressiion . Since the marriage was arranged I’m thinking she is not happy , cannot leave and has no means of support . Also poor nutrition is a factor as well . A lot of issues like that can look like dementia , but can be resolved and the person can get better. I’m sorry your mom is in this position .  I hope you can find the answer and she gets better.
The culprit for brain fog could be menopause, hormone replacement therapy can help. As well as vitamins, exercise, socializing. Exhaust all possibilities before giving up.

Dementia,Brain shrinking,"I am getting very little info about my stepfather through my mom but he has all the signs of dementia and it’s getting a lot worse.  She said the doctors didn’t say what kind of dementia, even after several brain scans and appointments over the last 6-8 months. But they did say his brain is shrinking. Does that narrow down what kind of dementia he has?  She gets little info and then passes down even less to me. She’s allowed in his appointments now but wasn’t at first because he would tell the doctor he didn’t want her there.  Oye.  

I know that’s not probably a lot of info - but it’s all I know for now.  
Thank you for reading.","It's odd to have several brain scans when trying to diagnose dementia.  Shrinking is a natural process but excessive shrinking is a sign of dementia.  The location and severity of the shrinking can indicate a likely cause.  

The most common cause by far of excessive shrinking is alzheimers but this wouldn't require multiple brain scans.
I believe in the early stages it’s  difficult  to tell the type of dementia. There are several types that can only be truly  diagnosed after death ,when an autopsy is done.  So as he progresses his doctor may have more answers  depending  on his behavior and testing. There are several web sites with information. I like  DEMENTIA CARE CENTRAL, which explains the different types and stages. It can help to keep a small journal and note his behavior  changes. This can help his doctor and is something I wish I had done earlier. It doesn’t need to be everyday. I hope this helps you .",2022-05-14 21:11:17,Girl--Gone-Mild,upuw84

Understanding the Changing Brain: A Positive Approach to Dementia Care by Teepa Snow
The Alzheimer’s Society’s AlzConnected has lots of forums and they are saved and topics are searchable. Between asking questions and searching, this was a life saver. Tam Cumming’s book, Untangling Alzheimer’s was the most helpful book. She explains the changes in the brain and her explanation of what is going on in each stage were the most helpful to me. There are also checklists of symptoms. I used these to discuss things with Mom’s doctor.
Have you watched Teepa Snow on tiktoc? She is fantastic. I think she has some books too. I'm in college right now to become a HCA and her practice is used a lot to teach us.
The 36 hour Day. By Nancy L. Mace and Peter V. Robin's.

Dementia,DVLA/NHS IN THE UK? What has been your experience with Alzheimers diagnosis & driving assessment?,"My dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimers in December 2021 after memory clinic assessment and review of brain scans from Sept 2021. We informed the DVLA of this in December 2021 and have received a holding letter to apologise for the delay in their reaction to whether it’s okay for my father to continue driving. My mother and I do not feel he is safe to drive, he had an accident in August 2021 which was entirely his fault, his reactions are not what they were and the mobility in his legs is effected (he shuffles a lot and gets cramps in his leg muscles) and we of course we informed the memory clinic nurse of our worries discreetly. As I’m sure is the case with a lot of men in their mid/late seventies who have just received this diagnosis, he says he feels no different at all and gets very defensive when we try to discuss his diagnosis and we think he hasn’t got a full grasp on what his diagnosis means (due to the condition, no doubt). Today, he received a letter from the consultant at the same memory clinic to say that he will be having a telephone assessment (due to Covid) regarding his ability to continue driving. Has this been the case for other people, he is of course going to tell the consultant and the memory clinic that he feels that he is fine to drive?! Does anyone UK based know if this is normal? He was just starting to get used to my mother being the driver and we’re desperately worried that if the NHS/DVLA tell him that he’s okay to continue driving based upon a telephone assessment (HOW CAN THEY MAKE THIS ASSESSMENT ON THE PHONE?) it will become a huge source of conflict if we try to stop him. Any UK based experience similar to this with DVLA/NHS would be greatly appreciated.","With my Dad it was much more strightforward. The Police found him trying to drive around a waterlogged field until he got stuck. They brought him home in a very distressed and confused state, handed me the keys (discreetly) and said not to let him drive anymore as he was obviously unfit. I hid the keys and disconnected the battery and told him the police had confiscated his license until he got his doctor and solicitor to witness that he was safe to drive. He raged and threatened to go to court, sue them etc. but never took any action. The police sent a court letter saying he could volutarily surrender his license or get a doctor to say he was fine to drive. He ignored it and so they revoked his license. This was about 2 years ago. He still occasionally says he will get his solicitor to ""sort them out"" but never acts on it.

Long story short, do not let him drive, tell him his licence has been taken away. The police would rather deal with an angry person with dementia than a grieving family who have lost loved relatives in an accident
There's a place on the gov website that allows you to report someone who you feel is no longer fit to drive.
https://contact.dvla.gov.uk/driver/capture_transaction_type?transaction_type_id=drivers_medical
We’re sort of going through this at the moment with my grandad. He’s 93 (I think? Or maybe 92) and if we’re completely honest shouldn’t have been driving for several years but no one ever took the plunge. He fell at the start of lockdown in 2020 and has fallen several times since then, each time making the dementia worse and his mobility now is at the point where he can barely walk 5 meters with a walking frame.

I finally but the bullet and reported him to the DVLA a couple of months back, although no one in my family knows I did it. I felt very strongly that I shouldn’t have to be the one to make that call given my dad and my aunt are both around and more involved but they both stuck to the line of thinking that he couldn’t get out ti the car so why did it matter.

Nana has now received a letter with a form to fill out to renew his license but he refuses to even accept the idea of not insuring the car this year, despite it costing over £500 (assuming he could even get insurance) and he is totally convinced that he will drive it again any day. I think nana is leaning towards just not filling it in and not telling him, with the proviso of hiding the keys etc.

As far as I know the form includes needing a doctor to certify they are safe to drive? Would it be an option for you to talk to his doctor about your concerns?",2022-05-14 07:37:54,DottieLassen,upffi2
Dementia,I can’t do this! Sorry I need to vent to someone. 😭,"Update:  I couldn’t do it anymore. I called my step siblings and told them I had to leave. One of them is driving up tomorrow to stay with her for a few days and try to find full time live in care for both of them. We had another huge blowup and I can’t fight with her anymore so I am catching a flight home tonight. 



Long story here, It’s 1:00am, I haven’t slept more than three hours a night for the past week. My mother who refuses to admit she has dementia (as did her sister, my Grandmother, and her grandmother) has decided that this is a perfect time to do laundry. 

I live out of state and made an emergency trip because she was in the hospital with a DVT (blood clot) and my stepfather is also in the hospital getting his fourth stint put in his heart. I get her out of the hospital and she is supposed to be on bed rest but that’s not happening.  We also spent the day at the ER because her arm hurt. 

My stepfather knows she has a problem and refuses to do anything about it. I have three step siblings that aren’t here and won’t or can’t provide any help. My stepfather is going to get out of the hospital in the next few days so then I get to have two full time patients. 

I’m sorry if this sounds horrible but I can’t keep doing this. I spent three months here last year doing the same thing when he was sick before. When he’s not here she spirals, won’t sleep, and the confusion gets ten times worse","24h care is usually considered a 4 shift job - the job of 4 people. You should not try do that work by yourself, it is not safe, not for you, not for your grandparents.
I’m so sorry. You don’t have to do this. Call adult protective services and have a social worker evaluate their situation.
You are not alone I did the same thing for my mother over the last three years and I finally moved her to assisted living and the few hours a week I spend with her so overwhelming I don’t even want to go. 

But you know what? You’ve got this! This is temporary but you need to involve the rest of your family and getting her set up in a place where she can be safe. Best of luck I’ll pray for you
Virtual hugs. Dementia is an extremely terrible and insidious disease. Those who have it typically don’t recognize that they have it. So it’s not as if they are refusing out of spite to admit that they have dementia they literally don’t believe her know they have it. There are times where if you can get them to the doctor where the doctor put it on paper that they have it may make it more real but they’re gonna soon forget what they were told. It’s a very wicked disease. I’m sorry you and others are going through this.
My mother also likes to do laundry in the dawn, but she has been diagnosed and I'm her official carer. I know it sucks, maybe you can try to give some melatonin at night or talk with a psychiatrist about her case. I think somehow you should try to diagnose her officialy, that seens the first step for a solution.  


Good luck and strenght!
Not that this works for everybody, but my strategy to combat feeling overwhelmed is to use a Google doc and create an outline of all my goals and resources. I highlight my next steps and put bold on the outcome along with crossing out when complete. I also saved a shortcut for it on my phone so all my notes are always at my fingertips.
If your mother still gets a full rest when she sleeps you will have to start sleep when she does. If you are lucky like me and your parent likes to do as much as they can for 5-6 hours then nap for 1-2 then you just try not to fall asleep. After a year or two you get used to it",2022-05-14 02:25:45,bousmommy,upb5y9
Dementia,How to deal with exhibitionism and vulgarity?,"My 78yo father has Alzheimer’s and is now prone to purposely removing his clothes, especially in front of female neighbours. He even urinates in front of them. A few of them have started avoiding our family and we suspect he does this regularly and they don’t know how to let us know. He has also started randomly shouting extremely bad words (lewd) at us (mother, sister and me are primary caregivers). We have new neighbours across the road with a pretty wife and a young daughter and a little son.

How do we deal with the fact that he’s sexually harassing us and our neighbours? He used to be a very respectable lecturer and consultant in his time so this behavior change is shocking to us.","Do a Google search for ""Teepa Snow sexually inappropriate"".     It brings up videos by dementia educator Teepa Snow and other caregiving training videos.   Hopefully one of those will be able to help.

I'd also call the Alzheimers Association jetliner at alz.org.
You are going to have to keep him inside. You can only expose yourself so many times before the police will get involved, which will be better than dealing with the father of the child he exposes himself to next. I'm sorry your neighborhood is going through this but this is something you have to handle.
I'm sorry you and your family are going though this, as I'm sure it's very difficult. I'm not sure what the best advice would be aside from talking to your neighbors.

 Is fencing an option? Perhaps he wouldn't feel the need to harass the neighbors if he can't see them.
Are your neighbors aware that he has dementia?  It seems reasonable to visit them to explain and give them your number to call if they see something inappropriate or upsetting. This might buy you an extra bit of kindness or tolerance.

However, he should not be allowed to go outside unattended.  I don't wish to be harsh, but am concerned about the risks to all involved. Although the neighbors may have some more understanding of what is happening, such behavior is disturbing and will be frightening for young children.  It's also humiliating for your father (even if he doesn't realize it.)  He also may injure himself or wander away.  If you cannot control his movements, it is time to place him somewhere where he will be safe from himself.
Unfortunately you are going to need someone to stay with him around the clock to prevent him from exposing himself to neighborhood children.  Immediately.

It is not just shocking, it is a very traumatic crime against minors. If the police get involved, a criminal record may prevent him from being placed in residential care in the future.

He might need more medication, home health aides, or residential care. Call his doctor ASAP. You or someone in your family needs to take the reins. If you let your neighbors solve this problem, no one will be happy with the results.
Sadly, it sounds like your Dad has the vascular variety of dementia. And unfortunately, the clothes stripping and sexual inappropriateness is very common with vascular dementia.

The behavior itself, you cannot stop or reason with them to stop. That part of their brain is damaged and their filter (as to what is right/wrong and appropriate/inappropriate) is gone. Lecturing, yelling at them, or punishing them will also not do anything. They cannot necessarily help that they are doing these things, and the filter is not going to come back, and the brain damage is not going to be reversed.

Biggest thing is going to have to be keeping him out of situations where he is most likely to do these things. Keep him inside when the neighbors are out. If he's doing it from a window, get the plastic/film you can put on the windows so the neighbors cannot see inside, should he be doing something inappropriate.

Sometimes, you can ""redirect"" them. Remove them from the situation and get them to doing something else...like watching tv, a puzzle...anything that was not what they were doing before. 

As far as family members living with him, and any caregivers that come in to help...they need to be educated about this, and understand this will happen. This is going to keep happening, and it's not something he has control of. Sometimes, if he is not so far gone, you can say something like ""That is not appropriate"" and then redirect him to something else. If it truly is something a family member or caregiver cannot stand, in the moment...make sure he is safe, and remove yourself from the situation for a few moments to compose yourself.

I think the worse case I dealt with as a nurse aide while working in a nursing home, was an older guy that would get handsy and say inappropriate things. His brain didn't care who. He would get handsy with female staff and residents. He got to a point we had to be aware of where he was at 100% of the time, as he got smacked multiple times by female residents he had got handsy with. He even inappropriately propositioned a 17 year old nurse aide we had working there. It got progressively worse until he passed. It was emotional for his family, as well. Until the dementia hit, he was nothing like that. He was a sweet, respectful, kind man...until dementia took all that away from him.

And while it's not sexually or clothes stripping inappropriate...there was a little old lady I helped take care of in her home. She was already pretty advanced in her dementia by the time I started working with her. And let me tell you, she could cuss enough to put a pirate to shame. Her husband would always talk about how much she had changed after getting dementia...and how she had NEVER once said a bad/vulgar word before.

Biggest thing for the family and caregivers...it's not personal. He cannot help it. He's not targeting people intentionally...outside of his brain potentially identifying female from male...and sometimes, the brain does not always care about that, either. It is not him inside his brain making these decisions. And I am pretty sure that if ""he"" (his pre-dementia self) were a spectator at any level of what is going on...he would be ashamed, upset, and feel very sorry. He wouldn't want this to be happening.
Its always difficult when these disinhibitions and behaviors start.

The answer to preventing these behaviors is medication.  Specifically, Seroquel is quite effective at controlling behaviors and hallucinations if he has them as well.  

Speak with his doctors about these behaviors and they will likely agree.  Seroquel is preferable to other antipsychotics because the others commonly cause Parkinsonism in older people which can lead to bad falls which in turn accelerates the dementia.
I think you should put him in a home.  If he gets caught doing something criminal or violent, he will not be accepted into a home later on so best get him in one now imo.  Also, I'm concerned for the safety of the female caregivers.  Do you think he may end up assaulting one of them someday?  He sounds like he's getting angrier with all the vulgar words.  Better safe than sorry imo.",2022-05-14 00:33:08,Hazel1002,up9ikl
Dementia,Hydrating candy?,"My grandmaw struggles with dehydration and constantly asks who said she has to drink all these liquids. Today the home health nurse told my mom about some hydrating jelly candy. My question is, has anyone tried to make anything like this themselves? I’m thinking of trying it with sugar free jello and candy molds. Any insight would be very much appreciated!","I assume they are talking about Jelly Drops. They just released them to the US (UK product) and we ordered them to try. They are much firmer than Jello and not sticky with no sugar. I put them in the fridge and give to my Grandma. She's only on the 1st tray. But eats them well. 

These are more like a finger food and I don't think jello would hold up like that. But I don't think there is anything wrong with trying Jello. 
Does she chew ice? Crushing ice and just giving a small cup may be an option. Unfortunately it is trial and error with hydrating. We tend to try to sit next to her and drink which makes her want to drink because she will be likely to mimic.
I would try the jello . My mom will drink jello before it set up. It can not hurt to try.
One thing that has worked for me is keeping mixed nuts by her chair. If she eats a couple nuts she will take at least 2-3 sips of water (or whatever I have put by her) to drink. And she loves nuts. It works with anything a little salty and even with unsalted stuff with some people because they drink after taking a bite.
I am the same way. I have water all the time. Maybe try googling how to tell if she's dehydrated and go from there. My mom drinks alot more milk than water but how much am I going to fight with her, she's seem to be fine. I watch for UTI's which dhe has not had so I am just finding small ways to get her to drink. 
Like if we are sitting in the yard she sips her water more 
It's so different which everyone.
Just keep trying. You are doing a good job
Sounds good, I would love home health care and I am very glad you have ones that help (heard stories about bad ones) 
Just keep trying different things you will find a combination that works. I completely understand the frustration
If you are looking at Jello, Google Knox blocks or finger Jello recipes. We used to make it all the time when we were kids. It will give you a good base to start with.",2022-05-13 20:15:29,Sea_Friendship_8555,up55q7
Dementia,making dad worse by getting his meds and walking away if he refused some?,"My stepmom says I'm making my dad become worse quicker by getting his meds and if he fights me about some, just walking away instead of fighting. She will argue with him about everything and it's just UGH! I thought I was doing the right thing...","You are doing the right thing! You cannot argue with people who have dementia. It doesn't work. When my mom refuses meds, I walk away and approach her 10-20 minutes later.
Prime example of my Grandma last night. 
""Lets go sit at the table and take your meds.""
Her response ""No.""
""Okay. Well I need to make your bed. Do you want to help me do it?""
""No.""
""Okay. Well I'm going to go make your bed.""
4 or 5 mins later she ventured in. We did bed time routine. Then told her ""Okay. Now we can go do your pills.""
She was fine with it by then.

I'm not sure if there is any way to give him a feeling of control over it. But him saying no might be his way of exerting some.
As my grandmother’s Alzheimer’s worsened so did my mother’s attitude. My mother insisted on fighting with my grandmother about every single thing. Meals, medications, tv shows, bed times, clothes, etc. My grandmother frequently talked about people who had passed away years ago because she had forgotten they had died. Instead of just playing along and having a pleasant conversation my mother insisted on telling her that the person was dead. She insisted that all of this was to “keep her grounded in reality as long as much as possible” but the reality is that it was just added stress for everyone and downright cruel. 

You’re doing the right thing. The added stress of your stepmother arguing is counterproductive and adding additional unnecessary drama to an already bad situation. I’d suggest that you tag along on your dad’s next doctor visit with your stepmother and have the doctor explain all of this to her. If she won’t listen to common sense maybe she’ll listen to a professional.

My sympathies and best wishes.
You are definitely in the right on this. Fighting with someone who can not understand won't help the situation any better and will you feeling traumatized and exhausted. Always best to disengage and try again later if possible.
What do y'all know about gabapentin for dementia?
My wife takes eight pills a day. She hates them with a passion. Trying to talk her into taking the pills is a waste of time. 

Putting the pills in her food has worked out the best for me. Some of the pills are small, a couple I will break into smaller pieces. Pancake and chocolate syrup, honey, ice cream, all mask the pill taste well. She has started chewing her food looking for the pills. I have been adding granola to the routine and making sure the pills are landing in the back of her mouth.
When my mom was 1st diagnosed my Dad (who was her primary caregiver until he died a year ago) decide that quality of life was more important then quantity. Not that he stopped trying to keep her health, but happy was more important. I have continued that. If she want a bowl of ice cream she gets one ( she's diabetic) I hope you find away to get him to stop fight his meds.

Dementia,Help with Mom’s neglectful live-in boyfriend,"I’m in a bit of a situation and I really don’t know what to do. My mother (diagnosed with dementia last year, has probably had it 5 years or so) lives with her long-time (25 years) boyfriend. They are both in their late 60s, early 70s. Neither is in good physical health. I have a strained relationship with my mom due to years of emotional neglect due to her mental illness. I also live (on purpose) 8 hours away.

Ok so the issue is, something happened in their basement that caused massive flooding and them to lose hot water, heat and washing machine use. The bill to repair it is bad.. like $12k (it was a long-standing issue that they ignored for years). Ok so this happened about TWO MONTHS ago and her boyfriend has not had it fixed. 

As I said I am far away, have little ability to do much remotely. I’ve offered to help him pay (and his brother has offered to split it with me) but he keeps dragging his feet and now refuses to do anything.

Let me make it clear, I hate this man. 

What makes me the most angry is my mother has to take sponge baths and when it was colder, sleep in her coat. He is supposed to take care of her and he is not. 

If I could afford it I would pay for the whole repair myself just to have it done. I wish I could travel home to confront him but I am pregnant and quite sick at the moment. 

Any advice? I want her to live at home as long as she can but he is making this very difficult.","Would you feel comfortable calling adult protective services?
I'm not sure what happens next. I would guess that they would give him a hard date to get it fixed. I just don't know what would happen if he didn't. I do know that if it was my mom I would call.
Contact adult services through her county social services. They will evaluate her situation and either provide resources to make her home livable and ensure that it's done asap by holding the bf accountable or put them up in a hotel until it's fixed (not sure who pays here). The most important thing is that they will have a record of their evaluation and contact with them, which may be helpful in the future, especially if the neglect continues. The report can be anonymous and if that goes nowhere, call the police and request a wellness check. They will do similar process as social services, but be a bit less warm fuzzies about it.
If it helps I’m currently working with adult protective services to get my grandpa help. I’m doing this all alone and it didn’t help that his dementia turned him against me. After he made multiple calls to the police they got APS involved and it has been a relief. The guy from APS constantly checks up on him and is getting him on Medicaid and a home attendant soon.",2022-05-13 18:44:54,NopeMcNopeface,up3fwr
Dementia,Home health aide insurance coverage.,Will insurance/Medicare cover an aide for my mom who has dementia? She recently moved into my home and I’m paying out of pocket,"[https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/home-health-services](https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/home-health-services)
Apply to your state agency for the aged.  It depends a lot on the state.  We were turned down in Texas, and told the only way she could get home health care was if she was bedridden.  My mom is healthy except for her dementia.
Call your insurance and ask.  My dads paid for them under certain circumstances.  They would not pay for general caregivers if my dad didn't need specialist treatment like nurses , occupational therapists, physical therapists.

Also call your agency for aging and disability.  They can set you up with social workers that can help you navigate through all this-not just getting a home health aide but everything.   Though for immediate assistance, the insurance company is your fastest bet if your insurance covers something.",2022-05-13 17:36:49,SnooCauliflowers2619,up22it
Dementia,Pet with dementia in the house of a person with dementia,"Is this common? 

How many of you have encountered a pet with dementia, also?","My SIL had an elderly cat with dementia. They require a lot of attention and regular visits to the vet. Are you saying that someone you know with dementia has a pet in their home with dementia?

Depending on level of the owner's cognitive decline, they may or may not be able to continue caring for the pet (with or without dementia). If someone is helping them, however, I don't see it being a problem.
Yes, very old dog. She was 15 and would walk from her bowl to her bed for 20 minutes until someone stopped her and gently put her in bed. She settled down or seemed lost and frightened in her own home. We knew it was time to let her rest. She had no quality of life.
I had a cat with catmentia. He would forget where the box was. He would constantly require attention and a special diet. You could tell when he forgot where he was going.
I have a theory about occult users being behind dementia and SZ.

I wonder, since dementia (and probably, SZ, also) appears in pets, like cats and dogs, if these occult users practice on animals, first, before they work their way up to people.",2022-05-13 14:14:14,sunflowerseeds91,uoxsmu
Dementia,Feeling Frustrated,"Last night my 9 year old daughter had a choir performance.  I didn’t want to leave my dad out but I had very little time in between school pick ups, sports practices, and getting to her performance. So, I called my dad and told him I would be there to pick him up and that he needed to take a shower, get dressed, and be ready to go. When we arrived to pick him up and he got in the car it was obvious he had not showered, he looked disheveled, and he smelled BAD! I didn’t have time to take him back inside to clean him up nor did I have the heart to tell him he couldn’t come with us so we took him the way he was. I felt bad that the kids were probably embarrassed to have him at their school that way.  

After the performance we went for a quick dinner at a deli which was also a struggle. Then, on the way home he cried about having to live at his assisted living facility and then got mad talking about some other issues. I felt bad for my 4 kids having to be in the car and witness that. I felt like he took away from my daughter‘s evening and kind of ruined the entire family time. I don’t want to leave him out but I also feel like my kids don’t deserve to have to deal with this all the time. I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

I just needed to vent to some people that might understand. This is so hard!","I understand your plight here. Slowly this spring I have stopped taking my mom to events. She just isn’t the same person as she used to be. She goes every now and then but I just made the decision I would rather have my kids try to remember how their abuela used to be.
The advice I've gotten from grandma's caregivers, as well as members here is to not remove your loved one from their home for events, because it really is stressful to them and causes unnecessary changes to their routines.

It's hard, because I want to take grandma out to her favorite places, but I know she'll get confused and agitated, and she'll take it out on us or on her caregivers back at her facility when we get back. It's not fair to anyone. Sorry you've had to go through that.
Dementia affects your ability to follow step-by-step instructions.  It also affects your ability to perceive how others perceive you.

So mom makes really loud comments about how fat and poorly dressed other residents are, and then complains that they don't like her.  Of course they don't like you Mom, they don't like how you talk about them. 

She also hates bathing so it's a miracle if she showers more than once a week.  

I also can't say ""I'm coming to pick you up in 10 minutes. It's raining out so you'll need sneakers instead of sandals and a raincoat.""  She will be surprise I'm there and won't have any idea of how to dress for the weather.  So I need to budget in enough time to help her get ready.  

It probably would have been better to leave dad out of this one, and let your daughter show him pictures after the event.  It's a good project for the kids, deciding which pictures go into Grandpop's picture book.

But don't kick yourself.  If your kids are upset that Grandpop is sad, explain to them that emotional outbursts are part of his dementia.  He wishes his life could be like it once was, but he needs additional help so he's safe.  He loves them very much.

Hugs.  Nothing about this is easy.
Your dad's metal tracking is off, and always will be. It is harmless - and often beneficial - to just agree with them, when they say something loony. ""Yes, the monkeys shouldn't be banging on the windows. That is a problem.""

The dementia sufferer is not having a conversation. They are looking for some connection, some validation.

Give that to them, and they will move on. Their mind will check that thing off the list, and move on.

And - if you prep your kids for it, by letting them know how dementia affects how our brains work - they can get in on it too.

It's harmless. He doesn't mean the nasty things. It's just the dementia talking. So if you agree with it, and don't push back or respond negatively, there's nothing for him to ""hook onto"" and prolong the conversation, and he will (hopefully) move on.
I understand where you are coming from. We are currently struggling with this regarding our son’s graduation. My son’s father is actually going to come and he is very excited about that. He wants to have a family dinner with me and his stepdad and his dad all together to celebrate his accomplishment. My mom wants to come. We have decided that she won’t attend because then the night would become about her. Illness or not, understanding or not, our kids deserve to have their own special moments.
Sounds like it was a learning experience. Your father is no longer able to get himself ready to go out, and he may need more assistance than he's getting in ""assisted"" living.  You may have to let something slide in order to take the time he needs when there's a special event.

It's not going to get easier. Sorry.
I am so sorry you are dealing with this, it's such a frustrating and hard process. I will state that while it's wonderful to try and include your Dad as often as possible -- there are times it simply won't be viable nor worthwhile for anyone.

The overwhelming majority of health care professionals and experts in the field of dementia care I have spoken to have stated that special events and major interruption to someones routine can be very stressful. If you do not have the ability to allocate extra time (sometimes HOURS) for, in this case, a child's performance -- it's ok to let dad sit this one out. 

 Perhaps you can visit the next day and show pictures? 

Plan a special dinner outing that Dad is the priority for and give yourself a few hours to ensure he is calm and prepared? 

I am so sorry you aren't able to have him 100% involved in all these special moments. This disease steals so much from all who it touches.
Can your children not understand that their grandfather is I'll? It sounds like it's something your struggling with as well. Calling your dad and asking him to shower and be ready for someone who wont remember you asked them only sets up yourself for a let down. You're dad being emotional and having mood swings on special occasions is bond to happen as he may not relate the special occasions in his mind when he is being emotional. Whatever illness anyone has it can impact family members. Your children are likely more resilient than your giving them credit for. It's also normal for you to get frustrated and not know what to do and when to involve him. Sometimes all you can do is your best.
I understand the frustration. My dad was always a bit of a homebody, but still enjoyed going out to dinner or the occasional quiet outing with friends and family. As his dementia progressed, though, he enjoyed it less and less because it got more and more overwhelming for him, and for, it just became more frustrating and stressful because he needed more and more active management and guidance.

Dementia involves a continuous lowering of expectations. At a certain point, I had to accept that my dad's ""going out"" days were at an end. He simply couldn't cope with it, didn't enjoy it, and his confusion and meltdowns robbed the rest of us of all enjoyment, too.

Please try not to feel obliged to bring your dad to these events. Yes, it feels wrong to leave him out, but you may need to make a mental adjustment where you accept that while he might previously have felt bad at being left out, now he feels bad at having to go.
It seems that you don’t understand the illness. If you educate yourself on the topic more you will resent him less. I know that you want to shield your children from it but they will have to understand the situation, too.
I understand. Even though my grandmother was alive and in a home, we didn't bring her to my wedding. She was alert enough to realize she had been left out, but we just didn't have anyone who was willing and able to care for her for the multi-day trip and event. It broke my heart, but even if we had, I don't think her memory would have lasted. At some point, it is better to visit, and share stories and pictures instead of physically having them present.
I found that any evening or afternoon events with my mother because very tedious because of her condition so I usually opt for morning things and drop her off after lunch. 

My son is very helpful but also embarrassed by his grandmother‘s condition and she’s trying very hard to keep herself together right now. I totally understand how you feel",2022-05-13 12:51:53,ohalice0722,uow2c0
Dementia,Frustrations with family not agreeing in what to do,"My FIL has dementia. He has been going downhill for the last 5 years. Last Jan he couldn't live alone anymore so we moved him in with us and he stayed with us for 10 months. It wasn't working. I had to go back into the office full time around Oct and we didn't feel comfortable with him home alone all day. He was so bored, getting angry and having daily outbursts where he would see him stomping and cussing us out while we were gone. Having bathroom issues and destroying our bathroom and his bedroom. Having outbursts and grouchy to our 2 children that our kids don't like him anymore. We told our BIL (who has sole POA) that he couldn't live with us anymore and we needed to get him on Medicaid and in a home. He has zero assets and only SSD.  My BIL said he didn't want him to go into a home and that he would move him into his house. So that's what happened. We told him we would take him for weekends when needed, but he couldn't be at our house alone anymore. Now it is months later, and my BIL is always mad at us, saying we don't help enough with him. We have said we couldn't take him a few times because he wanted him to come on a Wed-Mon or something similar and we put our foot down and said we would only take him on weekends. FIL is home alone all day at BIL house, but we don't feel comfortable with that at our house, especially now that he as been gone for 6 months and not familiar with our house. He says they are struggling and I think they are over having him live with them, just like we were.

He still hasn't started the process for medicaid.  Complains that everyplace they call has a mile long list for medicaid patients and he can't afford any other places. Yes that is why we said over a year ago to start the application and get on waiting lists! We can't do it as you made yourself and your wife POA and we have no power (they did this without our knowledge, when the POA was drafted and signed by my husband it had BIL and my husband, still no explanation really why its different). A year ago when he moved in with us, we tried to start the process and they blocked us at every attempt. They would handle it they said. Got mad at us for trying to do stuff. Almost everything we tried ran into a problem not being the POA as well. So we gave up.

My MIL (FIL's ex) toured a place last week that is a foster care type home that he can afford (basically a dump). But she said they don't take dementia patients. She told them he's not real bad, but she isn't around him enough to know. She said all they asked is if he can feed and dress himself. We are like yes he can put food in his mouth, but he can't fix himself a plate, sometimes we have to remind him how to eat something. He can put clothes on, but he puts on inappropriate clothes for the weather, multiple layers, backwards, inside out and etc. Usually you have to lay clothes out for him if you want him to dress appropriately. We have to remind him to shower, use deodorant and very often have to clean up after he has a bathroom accident. I don't think a foster care is what will work for him. He needs memory care. They don't want to put him in one because his whole life is smoking his cigarettes/weed and they won't let him in a nursing home. 

Don't know what to do, and so tired everyone being mad at us for not ""helping."" We are done helping when everything we suggest is just ignored. FIL had a bike worth around $6K. It was sold by BIL and we suggested using the money to prepay a funeral as the state can't take that when applying for medicaid. No he didn't want to do that, he wrote the selling paper work up that it sold for $3K and is ""hiding"" the money. Who know what that means. But what ever funeral costs come up down the road we aren't helping with until the $6K is applied. I am just so done.","Ugh- I completely understand your frustrations! DH and I are in a similar position with my MIL, except SIL has POA and calls all the shots (we’ve been rotating care between SIL, a BIL, and ourselves). MIL has type2 diabetes as well. It is a complex situation- MIL has advanced symptoms (including using her wastebasket as a toilet, not knowing who we are, issues with speech, etc), but SIL downplays symptoms to doc (I looked at her records and she’s been listed as MILD cognitive dementia since 2013....MILD my patootie!). SIL is slow-playing search for memory care and hiding any assets MIL has (just SSD) while continuing to insist MIL is stable enough to stay at home. There have been a lot of sour feelings between SIL and myself since MIL’s last stay with us- I am a type1 diabetic (SIL and BIL are type2)- because SIL didn’t like how she perceived I cared for her mom (feeding her healthy food choices and exercise- instead of alternative/ supplement/fasting methods of controlling MIL’s diabetes like she and BIL choose to do....sorry- that’s a whole separate kettle of fish rant). She mis-represented my care for MIL to the doc (saying I was controlling MIL’s diabetes too strictly), which I had to have an in-depth talk with the doc to explain how I was caring for MIL’s diabetes needs (that was SO offensive to me- I discovered SIL was hiding symptoms from doc, so doc thought MIL still had mild symptoms). SIL has been keeping MIL at her place since then- not sure if she’s still planning on care rotations (BIL should of had her a month ago but nothing has happened yet). The whole situation is very stressful- I personally think SIL is in denial about MIL’s eventual mortality (she’s going to be 90 next month) and wants to believe she can make her dementia improve (I get it, but that’s completely unrealistic), but the non-communication between care givers is creating rifts among siblings and a healthy dose of mistrust. I would suggest to you to stick to your guns- you’re correct in believing your FIL needs a memory care facility (caring for a family member at this stage is exhausting and depressing for caregivers). If your BIL doesn’t want to change anything regarding your FIL’s care, and only he has POA, then he needs to accept responsibility for his decisions (he can’t have it both ways regarding his expectations of you shouldering the responsibilities of his decisions). It’s a sucky situation for sure! I wish you luck and hope you can establish healthy boundaries with BIL if he continues to push his agendas on you without your consent.
> Don't know what to do

Sounds like you've done what you could. I would be thankful your brother decided he wanted this to be his problem. Sounds as though your brother chose this and I would remind him of that next time he complains.
It's not easy for anyone, and no one has any good answers.  You're doing what you can do, and your BIL is too, to the best of his ability.  Take a deep breath, try to be patient, and keep chipping away at the situation.  Just know that you're not alone in this, that everyone feels this way at some point in time, and that we call confirm yes, it all does terribly suck.

Sorry I can't give you anything more helpful...
Your brother in law is going to have to do most everything to get him into a place since he made himself poa.  I'm poa and I very much wish I wasn't so you're actually quite lucky imo.

That said, your bil could try the aging and disability office to see if a social worker can help you guys find a hone for him.  They typically know the hones more from what I was told.  Where I live, sone foster hones take dementia folks too but I'm not sure if it's through all stages of dementia.  Your social worker would know.",2022-05-13 12:27:30,LilDevil129,uovjqy
Dementia,Do you keep a journal for noting symptoms?,"I am wondering if anyone with dementia themselves, or a caretaker of someone with the illness, keeps meticulous records of the symptoms that they notice, as they occur.

If you don't do this, have you thought of trying this, as it may prove helpful to you, your loved ones, other sufferers, and researchers?","My caretaker provides detailed notes for me of what they did and what she repeats. She is there a few days a week.
This is something I wish I would have done from the beginning. To be able to track the changing behaviors and triggers and different methods I've tried in handling my loved ones decline could have been insightful knowledge in case I need it again for future reference. 

What keeps me from journaling is not having the time I need to formulate and structure the events that occurred. Stress and trauma has put a barrier around my brain that sometimes I just want to forget the bad days and not document them. Still it would have been a good idea cause through all this pain in caregiving,I've learned a lot in what it means for someone to suffer dementia.
I keep a list of new behaviors/confusions so I can give better info to the neurologist. I’m really trying to give them the info they need to move him from a diagnosis of MCI to FTD since that would make getting him approved for SSI disability much easier.
I did this early on, because my mom has a tendency to threaten litigation, and I wanted to make sure there was documentation of her behaviors in case she decided to challenge my POA.
Yes, and it’s helpful to correlate it with what they’re eating and how they’re sleeping. I’ve found if they have too much refined sugar or nap too much during the day then that lends itself to increased agitation and more difficulty with compliance.
That is an EXCELLENT idea!  You absolutely should.",2022-05-13 09:22:39,sunflowerseeds91,uornc4

Dementia,Intelligent drug delivery system - asking for advice.,"My grandmother does not take her depression pills. We are not sure about the cause, could be both attention seeking and simple forgetfulness, but the issue is serious as she once already had a temporary psychotic episode (thinking there are people in her house, that someone locked her inside even though she just lost her keys), due  to taking the pills and then abruptly stopping.   


Unfortunately, after that we had to get her to an old people's house as we live in a totally different city and the family that is there does not pay enough attention to her to keep her on her toes with her pills. However, she is a very assertive, and proud person so we think it is best that once she is comfortably back on her meds to let her live alone again, if she so desires.  


To that end I am looking for some intelligent contraptions, perhaps with a camera, that will track whether my grandmother actually does take her meds, and notify us wirelessly. Did any of you have experience with similar machines? Do you have any to recommend?","There are surveillance cameras that allow you to talk with the person. Wyze and Ring are two I know of off the top of my head. I guess you could set the cam up over the kitchen table and either call her or use the built in microphone to talk with her and simultaneously observe her taking the pill? 

The amazon devices have a check in feature for elderly family. Maybe one of those has a video conference feature too? That way there is some interaction and you could see her take her meds? 

All of these devices use wi fi. Otherwise, maybe set up her phone to allow zoom and someone has to zoom with her daily to observe her taking her meds?
There are automatic pill dispensers like the one below that will send off an alarm if she doesn't take the pills out of the box.  Some of these also have a smartphone app so you can more easily keep track as well.

If she's not taking them out of pride tho, you are much better off having someone watch her take them.

I use cameras with two-way speakers.  I have eufy cameras though there are plenty others that work too.  I also have an Amazon echo show which you can do drop in video calls with where she wouldn't have to pick up the call herself.  I've got a door sensor too to tell me if my dad is opening the cabinet where the pills are when he's not supposed to.  This way, I know if he's trying to take pills more often than he should.  He has this bad habit of pushing g the auto dispenser box so he can get more pills out of it when he's not supposed to so it was an extra security we needed.

I personally think you should leave her in the nursing hone tho.  She's gonna need it sooner or later.  I'd only take her out myself if you're afraid of her getting covid or something.

Dementia,Anyone to help a helpless newbie caregiver of an Alzheimer's patient with some information? Please!,"It started all of a sudden. My mom passed away on 07.07.2020. Her departure had a great impact on my dad as they were together for 42 years. From 2nd half of 2021 (June or July may be) we started observing some abnormalities like some illogical statements and questions(which were very occasional and unnoticable). But from then we noticed his excessive fascination towards sweet foods including ice creams, cakes, chocolates, candies etc. He has diabetes but he started eating candies and ice creams whenever he went out alone. I talked to the local grocery shop who informed me that Dad on average takes 5 to 10 ice creams daily. I was very annoyed on him because of this childish behavior because till then I didn't realized that he developed something like dementia or Alzheimer's. Things kept going like this till this year. Last week my dad left home in the midnight and when he got back I asked him why he left home and he couldn't answer me and he was very confused. That time I realized something is wrong with him which needs medical attention. Next day I rushed to a neurologist who told me that he has developed dementia and prescribed few medications including Donepezil Hydrochloride INN 5 mg tab once in the night, Quetiapine Fumerate 25 mg 2 tabs in the night and Ginkgo Biloba 60 MG tab twice a day. Since we started The meds he started hallucinating throughout the day. After a couple of days I contracted with the with the doc and he told me to discontinue Donepezil and continue the rest. But till today there is no progress and his deteriorating each day. I'm really confused whether this is because of the meds prescribed or his progressing so fast. Is it really possible to deteriorate within a week??
I have done extensive research for lost couple of days and discovered Alzheimer's is also termed as type 3 diabetes which leads to excessive fascination towards sweet foods because of some chemical imbalance in the brain. My doctor didn't tell me anything like this. Later I came across some researches which shows nasal insulin helps  Alzheimer's patients to some extent. I really want to try that out. Anyone ever tried Nasal insulin for Alzheimer's  or dementia?? I know it is not conclusive or approved yet, but I cannot see my dad suffering without any medical care.","Take your doctor to his general practitioner and check for a urinary tract infection or other typical issue. Elderly patients can become delirious from infections, which is separate from dementia. 

I’ve never heard about the sugar craving except that it could be an example of lack of inhibitions. 

Make sure your dad is not driving and set alarms or locks on the doors at night. 

I’m so sorry. I hope he gets the help he needs soon and you all can get some answers.
I’m so sorry to hear what’s happening with your dad. It’s possible your mother was covering for his behavior for some time which is why it seems so drastically different to you now. Definitely get him checked for a UTI which can exacerbate symptoms of dementia.
First off, I am sorry you are going through this. It isn't fun now, and it won't get better. Those are the simple facts with dementia.

Second, yes... dementia progresses at a different pace for everyone. But, stress accelerates it. The loss of his wife, his diabetes, and the confusion/frustration of Alzheimers will all make it worse.

Third, sweets. As you age you lose your sense of taste. The last sense to go is the ability to taste sweet. So most food tastes like nothing - or worse, tastes too salty - and sweets/candy/ice cream taste good. Dementia just accelerates this, and makes it worse. They will want sugar/candy ALL THE TIME, and it will be very hard to get them to eat anything healthy.

This is a big problem with my Dad, since he is largely sedentary now due to knee and back issues, Alzheimers, and a life-long sweet tooth.

My Mom has invented a ""salad"" for him, that is kind of like a Waldorf Salad. Shredded chicken, apples, walnuts, grapes, celery and a mayonnaise-based dressing. This can be eaten alone, or over shredded lettuce.

The chicken and nuts give essential proteins, and fats come from the nuts and mayo. The sweetness of the apples and grapes appeals to the sweet tooth, and is (probably) the only thing he is tasting.

Fourth, you have to communicate changes in behavior to your prescribing doctor IMMEDIATELY. Some medications react poorly with some forms of dementia and can make things worse VERY fast.

Fifth, dementia only gets worse. Your Dad's path is well-known and mapped. But how long it takes him to travel that path is unknown. He has lost the ability to plan ahead and think of the future, and his memory is failing, so the past is going away too. All he has is RIGHT NOW, this moment he is living in.

Your role for this journey is to adapt to his dementia and just try to link together as many good moments as possible, from now until he passes. If he's talking nonsense or making up stories or simply yammering, agree with him. Engage with the conversation HE is having. Ask leading questions - ""oh yea? what happened then?"" - and keep him in whatever happy place he has found.

There is no need to correct him when he says something wrong. It won't make any difference. His capacity for learning and retaining new information is gone, and - honestly - he'll forget you had the conversation in a little while, anyway.

Be flexible. Be empathetic. Be present. Be generous. It's all you can do to make this terrible journey as pleasant as possible for your father, and is the greatest demonstration of love you can give...
Honestly, I'd seek a second opinion and check for clinical trials in your area.
Just be realistic about your expectations.  As you can see, if you spend any time on here, there is no magic cure.  It's a progressive disease.  They get worse, not better.   No one here is touting a medication that has cured them or stopped their LO from suffering.  Absolutely look into this medication for your own peace of mind.  But spend your energies on finding care for your father, whether that be in home care or a nursing home.  I am sorry you're going through this.
I will give you the info I know/have. I have worked as a nurse aide for a bit over 20 years, and the majority of that time I spent working in nursing homes with elderly...many of whom had some type of dementia. I am also now the FT caregiver for my father, who has dementia, is diabetic, and cannot walk due to 2 spine surgeries last year.

Some of what I share may have already been stated by others.

When someone starts getting dementia, it can start out so mild that you do not even realize they have it. The changes in the brain have already started long before they start showing any symptoms. I have had patients who were diagnosed with dementia, and were still pretty with it...that I would not have known they had dementia if it had not been for knowing their diagnosis and health history. And as someone mentioned, your mom could have been taking care of him and managing it, so you did not even know he had the start of it.

Everyone progresses through their dementia differently. It can depend on age, overall health, the type of dementia, stress, and so much more. Even things like diabetes, stroke, and other medical conditions can influence and accelerate a decline. There was a medical study that showed individuals with Type I Diabetes were 93% more likely to develop dementia...mostly from the stress that diabetes has on all the body systems. You also mentioned your Dad has been eating tons of stuff he should not be...which means it blood sugars have not been under control...and that can put a lot of stress on the body.

As someone else mentioned, things like infections can cause dementia-like symptoms called delirium. Any type of infection can do this. Urinary tract infections, pneumonia, etc. My Dad had two huge pockets of infection in his spine. Working in nursing homes, I cannot tell you the personality changes I have seen in residents who had even just a urinary tract infection. In fact, it is SO common a thing, that if a patient starts acting weird (not their normal)...one of the first things they do is get a urine specimen to check for a UTI. Another big factor that can contribute to frequent UTIs is glucose in urine...which you see a lot of in patients who have diabetes that are not being managed well.

Behaviors...his behavior is going to change. There is NO way to predict how. Sometimes, if you know the type of dementia they have, you can get a general idea...but still NOT know 100%. For example, vascular dementia is notorious for inappropriate and/or sexual behaviors. But behaviors symptoms can be as mild as bad short term memory...but you can see things like hallucinations, psychosis, paranoia, wandering, aggression, depression, anxiety, getting physical/combative...when they get advanced, they may lose their ability to communicate, do anything for themselves, and sometimes may not even remember how to feed themselves.

How to handle behaviors...the BIGGEST things you can do to help prevent behaviors is to have a routine/familiarity and help orient them (to certain things) as best as you can. Try to make wake up times, meal times, and nap/bedtimes as consistent as possible. Try to get them engaged in hobbies and things they like to do, do it on a consistent basis. Keep things like calendars and clocks...on the correct date/month/year/time, to help them orient.

NEXT biggest thing is to keep an eye on basic needs...especially if they cannot communicate, or may not feel comfortable communicating. Make sure they are not hungry/thirsty, not tired, not bored/over stimulated, not too hot/cold, that something in their clothes is not too tight or scratchy, that they do not need to go to the bathroom or need changed, etc. Getting ahead of these needs and making sure they are met, can curb a lot of behaviors.

Now, if they are confused...the current thought/education is to GO with what they are saying/believing...as long as it is not a danger to others or them. If my Dad is hallucinating and saying there are chickens in the house...then I agree with him about the chickens in the house and do something about them. Even if there really are not chickens in the house. There have been times my Dad thinks he can still walk and would want me to get his walker...this is something that would NOT be safe for him...so something I would NOT agree on with him. But people with dementia...their brains are changing and are damaged. Their reality is NOT the same as our reality...no matter how much you try to convince them. It is easier, less behaviors...and less stress on them...to just go with it as long as there is no actual harm in it. If they think it's 1982, you agree with them.

Sometimes, we can go right along with these behaviors. Sometimes, we may have to redirect them. It's easy to agree it's 1982. It's a bit tougher if your person is thinking they need to get out of there because it's time to go to work or time to go home. If they think they need to work, find things for them to help with...appropriate to their level of ability. Give them towels to fold, cards to sort, etc. If you have someone insisting they need to leave to go home or they are looking for their ride...tell them it is raining and late, it's safer to spend the night and you will help them find a ride in the morning. If they are focused on and determined about one thing, try to redirect them to something else. If watching tv is getting them upset, maybe switch to some soothing music, or help them put a puzzle together.

Safety...If you have someone that was used to driving and they cannot any more, it is best to move the vehicle and/or hide keys. If they are prone to wandering, get door alarms, motion detectors, etc. Give your neighbors a heads up, and they may be able to let you know if they see them leave. If your person would normally frequent places, also give them a heads up...so if they do disappear, and they go to one of those places, you know. Keep current pictures, current medication and medical info on hand, etc...so that if they do disappear, you have what you need to help with a search.

Food...as someone else mentioned, food tastes can change. Taste buds start going bad, and food can be dull to them. Some get sugar cravings. Some end up only eating certain foods and will refuse all else. Sometimes changing up seasonings in foods can help. And sometimes, them eating the small amount of things they actually like, almost every day (within reason...do not want a diabetic having ice cream as their meal, all meals, every day)...because eating something all the time is better than not eating at all. My Dad eats a lot of fish sticks, shrimp, cheese & crackers, asparagus, brussell sprouts, various vegetables...a lot. Enough that I end up making my own separate stuff because I get tired of the same things all the time. But, because I make him what he wants to eat...he eats...and he has stopped losing weight. He dropped about 40 lbs in 6 months because he did not like what the hospital and rehab facility served. And he salts/peppers everything to death.

If they have a sweet tooth...try to find sugar free and low sugar alternatives. There are also healthy meal supplements that taste like milk shakes. They think they're drinking a milk shake, but they are getting calories/vitamins/minerals. You can get them in different flavors, too...vanilla, chocolate, strawberry being the most common. But I have seen mocha, butterscotch, and butter pecan, too. These drinks can also help a little bit with hydration...but you will need to make sure they're drinking enough water.

Some other less common seen recommendations...

Take them outside every so often to get a little bit of sun and fresh air. It can boost serotonin (elevates mood), helps you process vitamin D (stronger bones), can help you sleep a bit better at night...and can sometimes help them feel like they are not being cooped up all the time.

Try to keep them engaged during the day, and limit naps...so they will sleep at night. If they sleep a lot during the day, they won't sleep well at night. And if they have Sun Downer's (part of dementia where they seem normal during the day, and have symptoms/behaviors in the evening/night)...them sleeping better at night will make for less behaviors. Mental stimulation helps, especially with keeping them from being bored.

Try to meet their social/spiritual needs where possible. If they are more introverted, it's not as difficult. But make sure they get to see friends/family. If they had a hobby, try to keep them into some of it. If they gardened, try to help them. If they played bridge, sang in a choir, went to stamp/coin/whatever club...try to keep them active. If they went to church, help them get there when reasonable. Being cut off from everything they were used to...especially socially/spiritually...can lead to depression, anxiety, and behaviors.

That is all I can think of for now. If I think of anything, I will add it later. If you have any questions...feel free to ask.
My doctor prescribed something to help my mother sleep. I took it first because I wanted to see the side effects, it barely helped me with sleeping and I felt hung over for about an hour the next day. Gave it to my mom she slept nearly 10 hrs but the next day was a zombie really quiet, more problems that usual with talking needed help figuring out how to open doors.  No more of those for her, I'll stick to sleepy tea at night instead.
What type of dementia does he have? My mom has lewy's body dementia and it's progressing pretty fast.
My dad, not a diabetic, obsesses over chocolate, too. We have to hide most of it and leave a small daily ration in the fridge for him. 

Did the neurologist tell you what type of dementia?
Severe sleep apnea can also cause dementia-like symptoms, so you may want to have his GP rule that out as well.",2022-05-13 00:16:47,Odd_Economist_8898,uojh6e
Dementia,Theory,"I don’t know if this is allowed here, but I had a non scientifical thought.

Is it possible dementia is a way for us to grieve our own deaths? Forgetting our lives, friends and family to ease our own passing?","Doubtful but an interesting idea. Dementia makes the patient live in perpetual confusion and panic. Everything is different and nothing makes sense. Hallucinations and delusions are more common than rational thought.  

My MIL calls us every day screaming that people are attacking her and pulling her arm out of its socket or dragging her down the hallway by her hair.  None of this is true.  She's convinced people are accusing her of things. She begs to die.  

This isn't an easy disease.
That is an interesting thought on how to look at this disease,if only it were just forgetfulness that was the only problem. There are other factors to consider like loss of executive functions and this type of death is not a dignified one at all. The things I've witnessed my uncle do would shock,terrify and gross out most people. This is my experience and I'm still careing for him and watching his behaviour drastically change for the worse and to my knowledge he's not aware of his mental decaying. I wish dementia was simply about forgetting to ease our way out of this life so we are no longer worried or sad about the people we've lost. Everyone's experiences and opinions on this is different and I'm not a scientist either. We are all just doing our best to understand the not so easily understandable. In the end dementia sucks and wouldn't wish it on anybody.
Nope. Dementia is not just a disease that hits old people or people miserable and ready for death. Come meet my husband who I took to the doctor at age 51 to try and figure out what was changing him so.
My mom is only mildly impaired as of now, but I tend to see it as a gradual disconnection from reality and from life. It is much harsher on people around than on the ones with the illness themselves, who are mostly unaware of it, I think.
I also think a lot about it in terms of time perception: since there's hardly any recent memory, I think this last stage of life goes very fast for my mom, despite being terribly slow and repetitive for us. This comforts me in a way, since I think her suffering is significantly reduced time-wise.
My Mom has not forgotten her dead siblings.  She's forgotten us.  But thinks her dead siblings are still alive.  She fights and fights for us mean strangers to take her to them.  So it hasn't eased her own passing.  Right now, she's in hell.  Her brother is at home waiting for her, in her deluded mind, and we are preventing her from seeing him.
It's an interesting thought but it sounds more like your own rationalisation to explain an inexplicable horror rather than objective reality.
There are kids who go down the slide for the first time without a care in the world, excited for a new experience... And there are those who cling to the edges afraid of what comes next. I can see it...
It’s definitely something to ponder.   I’ve wondered myself if it was some sort of defense mechanism later on in relation to trauma or fear of death so you’re not alone.  
My grandmother lives in another time period in her head, before two of her children passed, before the family fell into estrangement, and before my grandfather passed.  Part of me always thought it was some sort of primal protection for the psyche.  Who knows.   It’s horrible to experience witnessing though.
But it is NOT an easy passing.  It can be long and tormented and I don't think anyone wants there family to remember them as incontinent, confused, unable to navigate the room they are in, unable to eat or swallow.  You look at your loved one and see this emptiness and they don't know who you are and I think they don't know who they are.  No, I think you are very wrong.
As someone diagnosed with early dementia and have been suicidal because of that diagnosis along with chronic pain I would have to say no. I'm not grieving death at all. I have great and reasonable concerns of the burden placed on my adult sons, one in particular.

Dementia,Need Closure From Other People Going Through This,"I (20) lost my father (54) today after succumbing to dementia (unspecified). I first found out during my senior year of high school after my family started to notice strange behaviors (like forgetting how to operate technology and wandering the house at night). Unfortunately, my dad started to lose the ability to care for himself at the start of the pandemic and was forced to enter a nursing home. I graduated high school and had to temporarily move cities for college (4.5 hours away) which means I have only been able to see him a handful of times during this process. I am overwhelmed with my memories of him, good and bad, sick and healthy. This has obviously been the hardest and most traumatic three years of my life, and I feel so alone.","I am sorry sorry for your loss and at such a young age.  I lost my dad 32 years ago,  I was 28. Cherish the good times,  try to put the bad behind you.
I am sorry this happened to your dad and family. It’s tragic. It’s no one’s fault. Sometimes life just isn’t fair. Grieve the loss as you are able.  Everyone takes their own time and their own way through.
I'm truly sorry to hear of dads passing and prior suffering from dementia. It is a struggle to cope with memories of how life is extremely changed when diagnosed with this disease. To slowly lose a loved one like this is very unfair and cruel. Many conflicting memories of how a loved one use to be verses how they end up is heartbreaking. My deepest sympathies goes out to you❤
I'm sorry for your loss. Grief is a complicated emotion, especially when it is a parent. I would recommend counseling. A safe place to talk it out can help. You may also consider writing. Even if it is just random thoughts or overwhelming feelings. Getting it out can be very helpful. If you are still in college, you might want to see what resources they can provide or assist with you finding.
You're definitely not alone. A lot of other people are feeling just what you are right now. I'm a bit ahead of you in the grieving process - I also lost my Dad to dementia. It's like a double whammy of grief: not just his passing, but also the dementia experience. Plus, for you, the age that this occurred is a third major traumatic grieving point. That is really a tragedy for all of you. Unfortunately the only way to get beyond the worst of the grief is to just go through it and give it time, and find moments of peace or even a little happiness whenever and wherever you can until the worst of it passes. It's a slow process. You will always have a pain in your heart for the loss of your Dad but it will become more tolerable and you will be able to think of good times without feeling overwhelmed by grief. Probably most or all of your friends have never suffered grief like this, and also could not relate to what you went through with the dementia. It's good you reached out to find others that can relate.  I know how bad it hurts. I promise it will get better.  You need lots of kindness, caring, and comfort right now and for a long while. You can do that for yourself but I hope you also have others around you that can give you lots of TLC.
I am so sorry. Sending you a great big motherly cyber hug. My daughter, 24, would possibly relate to you, although we are earlier on in this process than you. I want you to know, though, that the father you had most of your life only wants good things for you. He wants you to be happy and to achieve your dreams. I know you are grieving, and have been for years, but he would be so proud of you and your perseverance with your education. Get the support you need and keep working on your degree. You have so many wonderful experiences ahead, and your dad wants you to be ready for them. Sending you peace and love.",2022-05-12 01:17:41,Efficient_Passenger2,untkf2
Dementia,A time of change,"My friend of 9 years has been in the hospital for a month due to an injury. Sunday night he fell and broke arm. His dementia has been getting worse the last year and now I'm having to come to terms with the fact they he will never be able to come home.  I'm starting the process of securing his home and getting it ready for  sale. Just 5 weeks ago we were making plans to take a trip, getting his house ready to sell and find a smaller more manageable house,  but now that's over.  I'll visit him in the hospital and discuss our plans to keep him happy, but now I know it won't happen. We'd go shopping,  run errands, go to dinner.  I'm so sad that he's stuck in the hospital, but want to come home.  I feel so lonely that I'm losing my friend and it so stressful dealing with his doctors and his medical issues.","Thank you for being a friend and looking out for him.
I just moved my Mom to a Nursing Home and I am turning in the keys to her apartment tomorrow. I know exactly what you mean when you state that plans fall by the wayside and are unlikely to happen again. I am just thankful that my Mom still recognizes me. I think the day that she doesn't will be a milestone that I will have the most difficulty getting beyond...",2022-05-12 20:17:06,51225,uof5nd
Dementia,Can almost see the finish line,"I can almost see the finish line! I’ve been trying to place my mom into a nursing home since December 2021, and it’s taken another ER visit for the process to pick up…. She’s been in the hospital for 2 days and we’re waiting for a response, but it seems like forever for someone to get back and say they’re able to accept her.

Has anyone experienced this process ? was it a lengthy one? short ?What was the thing that hindered the transfer? I keep getting told that they’re going to be able to move her soon but that day is never arriving….","It really depends on where you live, but your story is similar to mine. I had to move in late last year to take care of my mom and we are nearing the finish line now, mainly due to legal reasons. My mother didn't have a POA. 

When this is done I'm moving to the other side of the country, west or east haven't decided yet, leaning towards west though.
I’m starting to look for a Memory Care facility. My Mom has been with me since February 2022 but I’ve quickly realized I can’t do this…it’s too much emotionally and mentally. She’s mobile and can put on a good facade publicly but sundowning is getting worse and earlier in the day. She can dress herself, eat, get around with a cane but wants to go “home” all the time, confabulation all the time and swears other people are here in my house. It’s truly maddening.

Dementia,Some early-stage dementia relief/good news,"My Dad's memory has been failing for several years, and he often repeats stories, fixates on specific things, and other usual early-stage dementia stuff.

His initial diagnosis was Alzheimers + Lewy Body. My sister is a Dementia Care Coach and has worked with seniors with dementia for decades (and lives with my parents!), so this was a hard diagnosis for us. We know well the Alzheimers journey, and the added complications of Lewy Body.

As things have settled down a bit after the initial diagnosis (and a stress-induced hallucinatory episode that was very scary), and my Dad is still the sweet, kind, generous man he has always been ... just with a lot of frustration over his diminished intellectual capacity and memory loss.

A week ago we did a follow up meeting with his brain doctors, and they have altered his diagnosis to Alzheimers with evidence of minor Vascular Dementia, but no Lewy Body.

While vascular dementia is no cakewalk, it is a MAJOR relief over the Lewy Body diagnosis!! This is a big win, a relief, and a diagnosis that is not as scary. The potential personality changes possible with Lewy were very concerning, since my Dad has always been a hugely loving, kind, and generous man.

There are not a lot of ""high points"" in the dementia journey, but today, this is a win for us.",Every win matters. I’m so happy for you and wish you all well! Cheers! 🤗,2022-05-12 13:27:39,happycj,uo6b65
Dementia,Mother is jealous and furious when I talk to other residents at the senior home?,"My mom is depressed, asks the same q's over and over and over (dementia).. so to entertain myself and make the visits bearable I have gotten to know some of her friends that she sits with at lunch. 

But, when I talk to them my mom rolls her eyes, flips her middle finger at her ""friends"", starts saying ""well I guess you forgot who I am.. YOUR MOTHER"" and ""well I guess you're not here to visit me so I'm going to leave now"".

She throws a major fit if I don't only give her attention. 

Well anyway, I tell her to leave and I stay with her ""friends"" and we chat and have a great time. I guess I've found surrogate parents at the senior home :) The more it happens, the less I want to see my mom.  My mom has no idea she sits with these people daily and says ""I don't give a f who these people are, but I know I'm your mother and I thought you were here to visit ME""

Has anyone experienced this extreme behavior?","They call it second childhood for a reason.  My mom claims she has no friends, but I know her friends and enjoy talking to them.  They understand, tolerate her dementia quirks and are very kind.  

Your mom is acting like a child, jealous of your attention to others. My mom's done similar things, leaving conversations abruptly when she's not the center of attention.  

I don't really have a solution.  If I bend over backwards to focus on her, she gets mad that I'm being condescending and treating her like a child.  If I treat her like an adult, she gets outraged that the whole world doesn't revolve around her.  

The funny thing is, my husband really does treat her like a child.  And she thinks he's wonderful.  Sigh.
Lol!  My MIL does the same!  She can't stand even the slightest pleasantries.  No big surprise that she keeps getting turfed from different dinner groups.  They finally paired her up with a deaf lady.
I have. My friend when he doesn't get his own way week get angry and say things like maybe I should just shoot myself.  The doctors don't care, etc. The doctors call it sundowning. By mid afternoon he starts to get irritable, doesn't understand what's going and why he can't go home.  He forgets. He called me 4 or 5 times from the hospital yesterday because he couldn't find the nurse call button. I had to call the nurses station at the hospital to check on him. He didn't remember that they had been in and called me in a panic. When I talk to him in the morning he doesn't remember much of the previous night and is very reasonable to talk to.

Your mom doesn't mean it. Don't leave, giver her your live and attention as best as you are able.
My mother does this, too!

I see other residents socializing and I talk with them about their family members and I make a huge fuss over the sweet pet dog that one lady has with her at all times.   My mother is pretty suspicious of everyone and asks in a demanding tone, ""Just how do you know all these people?""

Having a loved one with dementia has been a learning experience- I thought it was just about wandering and forgetfulness.  Oh, it does a number on moods, too.
When people ask what it's like taking care of a parent with dementia, I saying it's like taking care of a child.  My mother likes to show us her spit in restuarants, that's one of the reasons why I can't take her to resataurants any more. 

You're mom is throwing a fit because you are not giving her 100% of your attention in a space where there's other people, which is impossible, unrealistic and impolite.  That's something a child would do to. 

Try alone time first spend time with her, then remind her about when you shift to sharing time with others while your there to visit her.
My grandma doesn’t get jealous but she is exhibiting more teenage like behavior. She can be childish too—which is the same pretty much. She can be very rebellious or throw tantrums. Especially if we won’t “take her to see her parents.”
My mother didn't say anything like this to us, but I can tell you that my husband and I met two very nice women at my mom's assisted living facility before she moved into a nursing home. They were responsive and asked us questions... basically held a conversation, unlike my mom most days. So my husband and I would joke (not really ""joke"", but hopefully you understand) that we'd like to ""adopt"" these two nice ladies as my mother. I think in truth we meant it. So I understand where you're coming from.",2022-05-12 13:24:22,Plenty_Present348,uo68hh
Dementia,The unknown,"So, I have been watching and reading a lot over here this week.
Im not sure what to say, this will be just a rant I guess ..
Little background story.

I spend half my childhood with my grandparents. Then contact ended. No one really knows why. They’re a bit traditional and we had very different views on the world.
That said.

Every Friday I work in the building, my grandparents live.
At first I was like; pfff. No.
Then they invited me in, after years of ignoring. I felt obligated to do so, and we had a drink.
Then the next week they invited me in again.
Fast forward to me being actually happy every Friday to chat and had a drink with my grandparents again.
Till last week.

My mom told me that grandma is not doing okay. And they are searching what the hell is wrong with her. 
Long story short; she’s starting developing tremors in her arm. And has memory fog. 
This was probably going on for a year or so, but they finally addressed to the doctor when they went for their annual check up.
She is beginning to have trouble walking, very tired very easily. 
At her birthday she cried all day. Because of frustration and not knowing what is going on. At one point, she pointed at pictures of us all, and she could easily call out the name of my wife. But she forgot mine … and I am there every week. She knew  my name later on but that’s the part when all the alarm bells went off.
She had her first memory test last week. Next one with all the scans and all are in september.
But things don’t look good and are going downhill very fast. 
A day after her birthday she thought is was Monday again. Few hours later she thought it was mothersday and asked if there would be any visitations.
She told my grandpa she would wacht the floor and then sweep it with a wet towel.
When my grandpa came back from grocery shopping, she was sweeping. But was CONVINCED she would vacuum after sweeping. Etc etc.

Sorry for the rant. For all who stayed reading; thank you. 
They think it’s Lewy body or Parkinson dementia. But the part where it might not be dementia is already out of the picture ..
I finally got them back and than this. 
Im scared as hell. 


Thank you for me, to do my story. 
Sorry for the rant.","Sorry to hear that man. I think the hardest part for me is remember who my mom used to be.. then seeing her today. Yesterday she spent 20 minutes going through our mail. She read the names. One of the pieces of mail had my full name (a voting ballot). She asked who that was. Yea that hurt.. a lot, so we all understand what you are going through. Stay strong.
Yes, that's a hard one.  At my daughter's college graduation party my mom had to ask who I was. I was the one who took care of her for the 30 years after my dad passed.

Dementia,We are leaving and the guilt is almost unbearable.. Please tell me that we are making the right choice..,"I’m going to keep this short.. My FIL has LB and requires 24/7 care—which my husband and I have been providing for the past three years.. 

Pops has two other sons, one of which is a POA, collects the SS, and contributes ABSOLUTELY NOTHING towards his health or food.. We have NO HELP..

My husband and I have an eight year old daughter that I have had to homeschool and is able to leave the house once a week, if lucky…

We are about to leave this situation to the other brothers to handle this and move two states away so our daughter can be by her cousins and have an actual family experience.. 

I feel so bad packing up-knowing that nobody can take care of Pops like we do but our mental capability has been compromised…  

Our daughter is at an impressionable age and I don’t want her to remember being intimidated by Pop Pop because she wasn’t silent during the Price is Right..

I cannot imagine how my husband will feel but he NEEDS  a break..

I am thinking of calling APS for wellchecks after we leave..

Just such a guilty feeling and dread…

Sorry for the rant..


Hugs to everyone who knows the pain.. 💕","I thought you made a post recently where basically another son was collecting the SS. I couldn’t find it in your post history so maybe this is a common theme. 

You have to protect your family and especially your daughter. There are many stories on here about the trauma of growing up with a person with dementia in the house. 

As for the SS, report your brother to the SSA. There is an online form : https://secure.ssa.gov/pfrf/home
ruining your entire family's lives and future wont make pops healthier. look after yourselves. it is not your responsibility, and if you want to defend him, make sure someone who helps him is getting SS.
You can only do what you can do.
Move far enough away that you can keep your daughter safe and you aren't assumed to be available to help all the time.  But close enough that you can come to help if emergencies come up. That'll give you the nice break 

I don't know about the necessity of having cousins to have actual family experience.  I thought the people that create a family experience are immediate family members,  especially mom and dad.  A child that is cared for  by loving parents will most likely grow up to be a loving person.  Cousins can be visited like many people do.  

My mom is an angry, resentful,  manipulative, person so if she ever needs care, I'll help but if it's too much, I'd leave.  I won't have my kids with me. If one or two of my siblings can step in to help, I'd leave. 

I wouldn't leave my dad.  He's no where near perfect but he worked hard most of his life, and was the only one really worked to take care of us.  Not a good dad but we were never neglected or abandoned. My culture prefers boys over girls. He could had easily abandoned us girls.   

That's my long answer instead of, ""it depends"". Because every relationship history is different which can affect people's levels of patience and tolerance, and even love. 

Also, it seems you make the decision partly based on resentment.  Get rid of the resentment by notifying SSA. It's a federal crime. Maybe they'll make the guilty party pay back what was taken and some of that can compensate you and your family, or goes toward getting outside help.
There is a point where you have to make decisions that are hard but necessary.  You have put in three years so nothing wrong with turning over the care of your FIL.  I would contact social security and report the brother though.  You deserve to have the family life you want, do your best with finding ways to check up  on him to make sure he is being taken care of.  It seems like he should be in a facility, maybe that is the best place for him since you are leaving.  Do what's right for you and your family right now.  There is always guilt no matter what you do.
Just chiming in here, along with everyone else; you are doing the right thing for your young family, and there are professional resources available to help give your FIL the care he needs.

And report the POS that's stealing his SS checks.
It's really hard when you are caught in the middle - elders that need care and children still at home. I always feel like I should be doing more for dad, but I can't shortchange my children. Dad was always clear that he shouldn't be a burden and should be put in a facility and I feel the same way for myself when/if my time comes, but that doesn't stop me from feeling like I should do more with him and for him. I'm still biased in favor of taking care of my kids.
As the saying goes, you can't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  I understand what you are saying.  My mom with dementia wanted to move in with us in the worst way, but I could not allow that.  My husband & I both work full time & we have a 16 year old.  She gets home from school before we get home from work - as a mother, I could never put her in a situation where she's going to get home from school and walk into the house to who knows what.  I could NEVER do that to her.  I also don't force her to visit my mom in the nursing facility either.  Protect your daughter & yourselves.  We are not equipped to deal with this disease.  There are professionals for that.  Professionals that will allow dementia patients to have a little dignity while suffering from a disease that takes every last bit of it away.  

Also, I would call APS, too.  Just to get the situation on their radar in case it really goes south.

\*\*Hugs\*\*
If you are in the US, Pop should qualify for hospice. We used Brookdale. Nurses to help with bathing, toileting, meds, walking, feeding, physio, occupational and even music therapy as well as a chaplain if that's your thing. Just give them a call and they'll set up an assessment and go from there.
Is there a plan in place for his care? Are you starting the plan early as a trial run so you can work out any kinks before you leave?  

APS investigates reports of abuse when they receive a report that provides sufficient evidence. They don't do wellness checks as a normal course of business. Are you leaving a vulnerable person in a situation where you feel there is a high risk of neglect or abuse? Are you leaving your FIL in a situation where you know he will not receive sufficient care?  

Caring for yourselves and your daughter and taking a break and pursuing your own happiness is all fine and good but it does not absolve you from ensuring that you have adequately set your FIL up in a safe setting where he will get the care he needs before you just take off.
Don't feel guilty.  You are doing what is best for your daughter who is your primary responsibility.  Parenthood is sacrificial and one of the true ways we ""pay it forward"".  If our children are able to care for us without harming our grandchildren or themselves, that's a wonderful thing but no good parent would want to sacrifice their childs or grandchilds mental health for their own comfort
You're doing the right thing. Your first priority is your daughter. You and only you can ensure she gets the childhood she needs and deserves. Dementia caregiving is traumatizing not just for primary caregivers but for everyone in the household. That's just the truth, even with adult coping skills. A child will be deeply affected by seeing a grandparent like that, and not in a good way. On top of that, dementia caregiving takes ALL of your attention and sucks ALL the air out of the room, sooner or later. But you have a child to raise. You - and she - can't afford to have all of your attention going to Pops, instead, and that is what will happen if you stay.

I'm sorry. There are no good outcomes in dementia. The best you can do is what you're doing, which is to pick the least bad option overall.",2022-05-12 01:48:20,FrogPosse84,unu25b
Dementia,Awesome day 🌸,"Today was a good day! My 82-year old aunt with dementia walked, with her walker, to Starbucks and back — just under 1 mile. Yes, we stopped for some iced tea and egg bites so she could rest but she did it! A month ago, she had a really bad day and she had to rest 5 times on the way back to her house when we were only 2 blocks away from it. It was so bad, I ordered her a wheel chair that day so we could have it if she suddenly needed it. Took a photo of her happy little face, texted it to her sister and my cousins. It I’ll be a day I remember for awhile. 



Sorry, it’s just that I rarely have any good news to post on here.","Awesome!  Celebrate the successes!  This sounded amazing!
That's fantastic! Having a good day almost feels like a day off...almost. I definitely know the feeling and you deserve an awesome day!",2022-05-12 01:33:51,Potter299,untu74
Dementia,Nuplazid,"Hi friends,

I am caring for my 71yo father who has been diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia. He was taking Seroquel for about two weeks while waiting for insurance approval for Nuplazid. He hated the side effects — said it made him physically slow and exhausted. We switched to the Nuplazid a week ago and he says it makes him feel “crazy.” Can anyone share any person anecdotes about their loved one’s experience taking Nuplazid? 

More back information for those interested: he has been having “cognitive issues” for about two years, worsening significantly in times of stress (like when my mom was having surgery for example, but has otherwise been manageable). After my mom died suddenly in December things really took a turn for the worst and he has been declining rapidly. Finally convinced him to see a neurologist two
months ago who diagnosed him. He lives by himself in our family home which is across the country from where I live. I have no siblings, so I’ve been traveling back and forth frequently to get things in order for him but it’s becoming rapidly apparent that he is not capable of living alone nor is the isolation good for him. Vivid hallucinations started maybe three weeks ago and he went from understanding they were hallucinations to now being insistent that the people living in his house are real. (I have very much stepped inside his world with him, but other family members are still trying to correct him, which is upsetting for both of us.)

Edit: we have plans to move him to where I live.","Nuplazid takes a few weeks to start working and can be taken with seroquel.  To be honest, Nuplazid is kinda hit or miss. I have yet to see it really be effective.

That said, onset of hallucinations a few weeks ago is more concerning for a more acute issue going on like an infection or something.

I also highly highly recommend you get a referral to see a movement disorder specialist.  Very very often a Lewy body dementia diagnosis is really just Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  What frequently happens is a patient has memory loss and hallucinations and this results in a (often wrong) Lewy body diagnosis.

 To be honest, a movement disorder specialist is really the only doctor that can reliably diagnose Lewy body dementia.  If he does have parkinsonism then the movement specialist should take over his neurological care as he/she is infinitely more trained to deal with that as well.
Bearing in mind that this is my personal anecdote, sure. My dad had LDB and we found that Nuplazid did a far better job of controlling the delusions and hallucinations than Seroquel. We tried Seroquel for the month his neuropsych recommended, but it didn't seem to affect the psychotic symptoms. It just made him sleepy, and then he napped, and then he woke up crazier.

YMMV. Obviously the symptoms and responses are very individual. I feel like I should warn you that the Nuplazid eventually stopped working - I think the brain damage progressed past where the meds could do anything. But it bought us a good eight months of relative peace.",2022-05-11 23:57:52,jmp_951,uns6i9
Dementia,Where do I begin to help my uncle and to help me through this process?,"Friday I got a call from my cousin that my uncle (70) was admitted to the small local hospital this week and then was transported to our state university hospital in their brain and spine division. This was because my cousin noticed very unusual behavior from him during a phone call (saying he didnt reply to the text because he didnt know how to text.... which he has texted for years among other things) Pending results of several tests, we believe this is the start of dementia. It seems fairly rapid because he didn't show signs 3 months ago. 

I am very close with my uncle after his wife passed about 4 years ago. I drove down and visited him and spent several hours with him in the hospital.  I would say about 85% of the conversation was normal. The few unusual things I noticed:

1. He struggled with numbers. He confused my address, some quantity of things, was confused when I was talking money numbers, ect.
2. He told the nurse that he and I fished together all the time, but we never have (we have planned on doing it soon  but we didn't get to because of this)
3. He would tell stories or express violence in the story, which wasn't like him (example: ""I just wanted to choke him like this""

So far this has been difficult and I know the road ahead is even more so. Where do I begin really? I don't know what is appropriate for me to say. Do we let him know he might be having memory issues? do I never correct him if he gets things wrong? What do I do to help? What should I prepare myself for emotionally?Any good advice or resources? Thank you","I’m pretty new to this whole thing, but my understanding is not to correct. In my experience as a caregiver, dementia is a sea of darkness with each day being worst than the last basically until the end of their life, so my No. 1 goal with my dad is to try to have moments of joy in what otherwise would be a sad, confusing End of Times for him. A lot of that means not correcting, listening, making him feel heard, and gentle redirection. That said, there was a time early in that my dad could understand he had some sort of brain illness that was causing confusion and it helped to talk about it because what he wanted was an explanation. I switched to “stepping into his world” when the explanation became upsetting to him. 

Dementia care blazers has been recommended to me 
I really like teepa snow on tiktok for very practical ways to de-escalate combativeness
Get in the habit of reflecting back/responding to the emotion he is expressing instead of the words he's using.

Told the nurse the two of you went fishing all the time: ""I'm really looking forward to going fishing. What do you like about it?""

Saying he wanted to choke someone: ""Sounds like you were really angry. That must have been frustrating.""
Dementia is the worst improv theater experience ever. And people don't get better. Dementia only gets worse, and the rate at which it progresses is completely unpredictable, and different for every person. Stress and injuries can kick the dementia progression into overdrive, and age someone several years in a matter of days.

As their dementia progresses, the individual knows things are wrong, but no longer has the cognitive abilities to assess their own condition and why things seem ""off"" or ""weird"". This just leads to frustration that builds and builds.

Memory loss and fixation will become more and more prevalent. Losing short-term memory. Repeating themselves. And then often this comes with fixation, too. So because they know something is wrong, and they are forgetful, they will get totally fixated on a topic (""we need to make sure the oven is turned off!"" and repeating this every minute or two for hours), and will get upset when they feel like their concerns are not being taken seriously.

The dementia sufferer quickly loses the ability to plan for the future (due to short-term memory loss), while also losing their memory of the past, so all they have is RIGHT NOW; this very moment.

You, as their loved one, have one solitary role: make this moment as good as possible for the dementia sufferer. And then the next moment. And the moment after that.

You need to constantly re-evaluate your plans and the state your loved one is in, and adapt to their changing state of dementia. Every morning, the dementia sufferer will wake up with different symptoms. Today it may be fixation. Tomorrow it may be the inability to think at all, or inability to make simple sentences. The next day they may be bright and cheery and having a ""good"" day.

You never know, and that state can change in a few minutes. You just need to listen to their words and how they express themselves, watch their hands and body motions, and learn to quickly shift your interactions with them to adapt to however the dementia is manifesting in this moment.

They only have the current moment they are living in right now. Make that moment good, and move into the next moment. And the next one. And so on...
It’s not an easy conversation and it’s natural that he may be defensive, angry or even in denial that anything is wrong.

Here is the best way to let him know you have concerns:

• Firstly, plan when you are going to have the conversation. Timing is key. Make sure it’s when you’re both at your best.

• Choose the right environment. Somewhere quiet and comfortable is key.

• Decide in advance what you are going to say.

• Gently express that you are concerned about them because he hasn't been himself lately. Don’t say it in a critical or accusing way – otherwise he may become defensive. Use a gentle tone of voice.

• Be aware of your body language when having the conversation.

• You can start by saying that you are worried about his memory and ask if he has the same concerns. He may deny that anything is wrong. If this happens, don’t argue with him but give specific examples of things that have happened lately to cause concern.

• Be ready for any reaction. He may be angry, upset, confused or frightened. He may be pleased or relieved, or he may be embarrassed. If he reacts angrily, leave it and try again another day.

• Let him know you are there to help and that you want to make sure he is OK.

• If he does open up about concerns he has, ask him what he has been finding difficult lately and where he thinks he needs help.

• Try to put yourself in his shoes.

• Don’t be prescriptive and say you think he has dementia.

Dementia,I'm struggling...,"I need to vent - please do your best to not judge me. I promise I'm trying...

I (30m) have been taking care of my mom (69 - nice) since March of 2021. I love my mom, but I've never really liked her as a person. She is very quick to anger, has no patience, has no understanding of most things in life. She's very loud, obnoxious, no understanding of privacy, rude to strangers, etc.. I moved out of her house at the ripe age of 15 because her and I just didn't get along. Constant fighting and screaming. I moved to a different city at 19 (she followed me) and got married at 21. During my marriage my now ex wife and her never really got along. Due to that my mother and I didn't spend much time together. 

Since my divorce(2020), I knew she (my mom) was lonely and could tell her health was declining, so I offered her to move in with me. I sold my house a little over a month ago because the housing market was so hot, and purchased some land out in the country and am building a house. I already bought her a tiny home that will also be going on my property because the goal is for me to still be readily available to her, but I need my own space, as does she.

We are currently staying in the tiny house together on the property of the people who sold it to us (very thankful for them or we would be in a much rougher situation). Its her, me, and 5 cats... in a 500 sq ft house. I have no one. I have 2 friends but they are long distance. I have 0 relatives. It's just me and her.  Over the passed few months her lack of memory has worsened substantially. I answer the same questions 30 to 50 times a day. I have to do literally everything and everything is my fault. Internet going slow? Let's scream and throw laptops and blame me for putting her in this situation.

I wanted to get moved before her condition got to a point to where I couldn't manage it alone, make it to where we didnt have a mortage and our over all expenses were almost non existent so I could focus on her. I thought I was doing the right thing. But everyday for the passed month it's just all my fault. I can't do anything right. I of course know this isn't true, but man is it affecting Me. 

I have untreated bi polar depression which makes it a little tougher but I manage it myself. I try my best to stay strong but sometimes I leave the house to go do laundry and just sit and cry. We are only in the beginning stages of this and it's already unbearable. Idk how I can continue like this. I know my circumstances will improve once my house is built and we each have our own space.

I understand what she is going through is terrible, and I know she's afraid, but dude... im just one guy and I'm doing my best to remain patient, positive, and helpful but my motivation is quickly fading. I'm building a resentment inside me that feels so unfair to her. I'm starting to snap back at her and frankly, my patience tank is on empty. 

She just was never really that good of a person or a loving mom, and this disease is making it so much worse, but shes still my mom. I'm a good person and a good son. I want to be. I aim to be. But this situation is making me feel like a POS and idk what I'm doing. I don't have kids. I would never want them because I'm not made for that... And this is like having a giant kid, but the future isn't them growing up and doing their own thing... the future is dark, scary, lonely, and hollow. 

The entire reason im doing any of this is because I want to spend time with her. I know our time together is limited and I want to make memories since we never really got to when I was younger. I want to take her fishing, I want to take her sight seeing and go for walks around the lake. I want to make her smile and laugh. But there isnt much of that happening... its just complaints, demands, and negativity.

I promise I'm trying...

If you made it to the end of this, thank you for taking the time to read it. Advice is welcome, but I mostly just needed to get that off my chest.

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone that has read this, provided feedback, given insight, and for sharing your stories with me. Today I feel refreshed & reinvigorated, and it's thanks to you all. Sometimes we forget the impact we can have on one another, and being in a world filled with so much shit, it's nice to find a clean toilet. Thanks again to all of you, and if anyone ever needs to talk or vent, don't hesitate to reach out.","Send her to a home. You owe her nothing to be brutally honest about it.

"" Every relationship in life, except for the one with your child who's a minor, is optional. ""- from my therapist

My step mom has developed dementia and she was horrifically abusive to me, I feel sad for her and feel sympathy and empathy for her but I do not owe her anything. Not a second of my time or life.

I have learned the pain of letting your parents go if far far far less than the pain of allowing them to stay in your life.

Will it be hard to send her to a home? Yes. 

Will it be Hard to keep taking care of her? Yes.

Choose yourself.
Well you came to the right place. Everyone here totally gets it. It is so hard to take care of a loved one who isn't loving. I'm going through a similar situation with my dad. It's the hardest thing I've ever done and most days I think I made a colossal mistake. But I'm learning a lot as a person and I'm growing so that's something.. but I also feel like it's taking years off my life and I hate the person I become. 
For you I would say get your housing situation straightened up as quickly as you can and just focus on getting that done because once your mom is in a stable predictable routine in her own space she might be a little easier to deal with. And the other thing is you've got to find a support network local.  Hopefully others can advise you on that.  I moved my dad in with me so I already had my local friends and neighbors and church and without them I wouldn't be able to do this. Even if you had a great relationship with your mom and totally adored her, it would still be the hardest thing you've ever done. We do it and we get through it one day at a time. You're a good person and a good son and don't let her make you doubt that for one second. Hang in there.
Hoo-boy. Not judging, but nodding my head in sympathy. 500 sq ft sounds like awfully tight quarters, and piney woods TX is getting hot about now. Used to live in Houston. And 5 cats?… one cat every 100 sq ft. 

The house may be under construction, but can you invest in a toolshed big enough to stand up in, hook it up to AC, just to have your own space to hide in? Shed can be repurposed for tools, mower, etc. later. Just a thought. 

You ***are*** a good person, a good son, heck, a saint.
I would put her in a home, I am also taking care of my mom, I love her but she and I aren't close. All the advice I have received from my friends who are medical professionals was to put her in a facility before she's too far gone. Their reasoning is so she can form some type of memory of the home and if she is placed when she is too far she will freak out.  


Taking care of a dementia patient is tough work, it sucks the life out of you. I used to stress cry all the time and I used to think of ""what if I just left..."" I've had mental breakdowns because no one was helping me with her. I love my mom and wanted to make memories too but my only memories are just me slowly dying while I was trying to make other people around me happy by keeping her home and only few happy memories of her and I.

&#x200B;

 Don't feel guilty about putting in her somewhere or that you feel responsible for taking care of her, at the end of the day she will need professional help and it will be in her best interest and it will also be in your best interest and you will be able to make happier memories visiting her. Honestly I wish I took the advice from the start because now I'm waiting for her to be placed in a facility and it's been 6 months ! Sadly her case worker said it would be easier to place her if she was admitted into the hospital because they would accept her quicker.... Good luck to you !
My mom and I (f) are the same literal ages as you and your mom, my mom has had Alzheimer’s for about 7 years now. I just got to Reddit so whenever I read posts like this I feel less alone in this world. And that’s comforting in a weird way because we’re going through IT and still going. Your life has changed quickly these past few years (during a pandemic) and maybe there’s still some processing of it all to do. These bad times are temporary. What you’re doing is great but don’t forget to also prioritize yourself. Your well being and mental health are most important. Getting stuff off your chest is a great way to destress and also help others. I’m sorry to hear about all of the history with your mom, I hope you’re able to heal from that. Therapy helped me work through the complexities of life and they can provide resources on how to approach interactions with your mom. This shit is hard, celebrate your small wins. Congrats on your new place, shouts out to you for being a down ass son, and don’t forget to do things that make you happy once in a while.
I wish I had practical advice for you, but all I can offer is commiseration. My partner and I are queer and non-binary and their mother is a homophobic evangelical. Their relationship has always been complicated and now she has mid-late stage dementia with no other family to help. I know that having a loving relationship and many wonderful memories with the person you’re caregiving for is a different kind of difficulty and pain that I wouldn’t want to diminish, but for us, maintaining compassion when things are difficult can be a real challenge. It’s another layer of emotional complexity. In our case MIL has gotten much more agreeable and less likely to say nasty things as she loses function but I know that’s not always the case. Hold compassion for yourself and know that you are doing your best to help your mother despite your past. If the time comes when things are too difficult to manage yourself, you will know you tried. Your mother is lucky to have you.

I agree with this so much.  After taking care of my grandmother I'm not sure I could ever have kids even if I wanted them.  I tell myself the goal to caring for kids is they grow up to be happy and independent so it'd be different.  But then I'm reminded it only gets worse with my grandma.  Hollow is a good word to describe it.  


I hope your house gets built quickly and things even out in the tiny home!
My husband has dementia and the worst part is the loneliness. If something significant happens, I can’t really share it with him because he can’t follow a conversation and also he has lost any empathy. 

I do have a few friends that I can vent to or discuss significant events in my life. That, this group, and a FB group for Lewy body dementia have kept me sane. 

I can’t even imagine doing it for an abusive person. I know people are saying to put her in a home but I joked to my husband that he didn’t have to worry about me putting him in a home once I found out the cost. 

I did have to put him in respite care bc I had pneumonia and it cost $4000 for two weeks.
I feel for you, and please don’t be so hard on yourself.  This reminds me a lot if my mother’s situation, right down to the abuse and the cat hoarding.  

My father endured 7 years of her dementia before he finally withered and died.  It was heartbreaking.  There followed about 4 months of total chaos as mom tried to live alone.  Finally she was hospitalized for something unrelated and from there we were able to transfer her to a home, where she’s been ever since.  She is much happier there.  It was a hard transition, but now she has friends, a community, and a team of professionals looking after her.


My point is: if you have the opportunity to put her in the care of professionals (i.e., a home), TAKE IT.  Stop feeling guilty or like you “owe” her something.  This is not a happy life for either of you.   Even if she was happy (which she isn’t), that’s not something to sacrifice your own life/well being for.  You are not a bad son.  She needs professional care.  Period.
Memory care seems like a good idea. 
You can remain involved and see her when you like.
The professionals can handle her violence and foul moods.
My husband and I have been going through this with his mom.  The people on here sound harsh, I know.  Let me share a few things I have learned over the last hellish year:


1. It will never be better than it is right now.  She may have good days and bad days, but if you graph it, that line is only going down. 


2. It won't be a linear decline.  With meds, she may seem to stabilize at a level for a while.  Then, there could be a health crisis or event, and she can get drastically worse literally over night.


3. Your current plan won't work (said with love).  Right now, she can safely use a toaster oven, and won't get up in the middle of the night in February and try to go walking barefoot for miles.  It may fail immediately, six months in, or maybe a year, but it will fail, and be dangerous for her.


4. You can't do this alone.  You are a caring, stand up person, but dementia patients have a lot of unpleasant stages that require a lot of help.  Soon enough, she will fight showering.  She will likely get incontinent and need help with diaper changes throughout the day.  If left unsupervised, she may smear poop, injur herself, try to commit suicide, or wander, among a billion possibilities.


5. Making a workable plan now is important.  


Are her affairs in order?  Does she have a power of attorney and health care proxy?  Does she agree to a DNR (a kindness to miss the ugly end, I promise).  Have you ensured she cant drive (super dangerous, even today) and has controlled access to her money (when we cleaned out my MILs apartment, she had thousands of dollars in Amazon orders, unneeded and unopened, including 4 electric griddles).


 Does she have money for an assisted living facility?  There are really nice ones that give social opportunities, great food, and can help with medication and hygiene.  My MILs had a salon onsite, a cat and a dog, and were amazing.


Once she is past living with you or in assisted living (and that time will come, unless she dies first) have you planned for affording the nursing home?  Depending on where you are, they can be more than 10k per month.  Smart to talk to an elder care lawyer to find out what will need to be done if she runs through her resources and needs medicaid (us) - its involved, and takes preparation. 


I am so sorry you, and she, are going through this.  It's horrible, for both of you.  The best you can do is be really realistic, plan, and love her.
OP, you seem like an extremely kind person. I hope some of the advice you got is helpful. There's something about being young and having to care for your parents that is extra tricky. The shift in roles, the lack of advice you would traditionally get from your parents, and (if you're like me) the resentment you feel when you encounter your peers interacting with their ""normal"" parents.


My mom moved into a home in the same state as my sis and I and we had big hopes for being able to do things with her and show her stuff. Unfortunately, it was just too much for her. I totally get how you would want to make those memories with her but also want to warn you that those new memories would be for you, not for her.  


Look for small instances in your day to day activities that make you smile. For example my mom once called me panicking because she thought I had been in a car accident and she told me she had been ""watching CNN to make sure nothing bad had happened."" 
It was messed up she was so freaked out for no reason, but now I know my mom considers me to be CNN newsworthy.
I completely understand what you are going thru.  My Mom was never the loving parent that my friends had to support them.  My Mom was more interested in going out with her friends to the local dance hall to see what man would show interest in her.  I was last on her priority list.  As an only child, I had no siblings to help me thru those lonely years.  My Mom was extremely selfish.  I took a vow right then that as I became an adult and if I ever became a Mom, I would be there for my children.  I also vowed that I would never be so co-dependent that I had to have a partner in my life.  I lived by the motto ""if it has to be it's up to me"" and became a very strong woman.  

Fast forward to the year 20\`15 and my Mom was living alone after the break-up of an abusive marriage in 2000.   After the break-up, she moved across country to live near me and did so successfully for at least a decade.   I get a call from her landlord that she is driving the neighbors nuts.  She is always knocking on their doors at all hours of the day and night.  I invited my Mom to live with me and my husband and that is when the difficulties began.

Mom would never give us any privacy.  She demanded to be not only in our house but if we were watching a television show, she had to be right there on the sofa with us.  We could never go out to dinner without her.  Oh don't get me wrong, we tried to be inclusive for many years but then felt a twinge of resentfulness when we could not even go out alone without her.  She would call all the neighbors and tell them that we abandoned her and she had no idea where we went or when we would be back.  This was clearly the start of the path of dementia.    My Mom's co-dependent nature was back stronger than ever with no ""man"" in her life and only the two of us to keep her company.  This goes on for the next six years!  Yes, six long years.  I have a saint for a husband!!!  She berated him whenever and wherever she could including in front of our friends.  

Fast forward to this year (2022) and I am diagnosed with a non-cancerous brain tumor.  My surgeon made it very clear that I could not possibly take care of myself and a dementia patient.  My husband and I found a local ""Extended Care Facility"" that does have care for dementia patients.  We placed my Mom in this facility three days before I had to go to another city for my surgery.  She went kicking and screaming as she said she didn't need this type of care and could stay home by herself.  At this point in time, she could not cook a meal, cannot take her medicine on schedule, does not drive so she could not go to the store, and we transport her everywhere to all medical appointments, etc.    As soon as I returned home from the surgery, my days were filled with peace and serenity. My husband and I resumed our marriage.  We started to enjoy life again.

My Mom has been in the extended care facility for almost four (4) months now.  She is adapting although there are good days and bad days.  Her dementia is moderate to severe as diagnosed by several doctors.  

Do yourself a BIG favor and find a suitable home for your Mom.  Don't continue to live under her tyranny as my husband and I did for almost seven years.  Start investigating those local facilities around your town, city or state.  Go to your local elder care, Social Security (Medicare), Medicaid experts and let them guide you thru the process.  Even the nursing home you choose knows the paperwork that is involved in getting your Mom into a suitable environment.  These homes have experts who are trained in dementia care.

Dementia,This sh*t is hard,"I’m 24 and take care of my grandma w dementia. I used to get so annoyed at her constant talking, but I wish she were able to look me in the eye and have be able to speak any words to me. I used to hate how she wanted me to walk with her 15 times an hour every single day, now I wish I could go on one more walk w her on her feet. Fuck dementia, man","Sorry to hear about your grandma, I feel your pain. I know what it’s like, the same thing happened to me when I was 22. I spent nearly 2 and a half years caring for my grandma with dementia. The conversations we had then compared to now are very very different. My grandma’s dementia got bad in the peak of the pandemic and given her age, we couldn’t take her to the hospital to see a specialist. My grandma raised me since I was a child so to be with her every day, to then slowly lose bits of her is heartbreaking. I always gave my all caring for her, but eventually I had no choice but to seek professional help. I never wanted to do that but it got so hard to deal with both mentally and physically. When I had to make the decision I felt terribly guilty, even now I feel a sense of guilt and question whether I could have cared for her for longer. But the truth is, I was miserable. I know if she were well she wouldn’t have wanted me to be upset or putting my life on hold for her. The most important thing is that you remember them for who they really are. Your grandma would be proud of how you’ve handled it.
looking at my post history, just TWO MONTHS ago i was tired of walking for hours a day, seeking any advice for how to get her to sit down and relax. how the disease has progressed in the last 2 months is absolutely insane. even the hospice social worker didn’t recognize her after a month of not seeing her.",2022-05-11 19:16:47,MyNamesArise,unmsm7
Dementia,„I quite like these foreign sounding nuts“ he says with a mouth full of raw pasta i probably shouldn’t laugh but it just is kinda funny,,"I think its ok to laugh. Humor is the better way instead of being upset since as you know dealing with a loved one with dementia is beyond tough. My uncle has moments of eating things and some things inedible so I have to watch him with things he's tried to eat like napkins,magazine's and bottle caps that I've taken away. Once he ate unpopped popcorn kernels lol it didn't hurt him and he seemed to enjoy them.
Why not laugh? Getting through this without a sense of humor would be even harder than it already is. And thanks for the laugh.  

My mom was mixing her blueberries into her ratatouille. She offered me some, and I told her I already ate, and she kept on, telling me how good the blueberry ratatouille was. I had to chuckle. Hey, as long as she likes it!
I found my Mother spreading yogurt on a piece of bread, folded it in half and swore she’d always eaten yogurt sandwiches!
😆😆😆that’s funny. My grandma does stuff like this
LOL
Sad smile.
That's gorgeous ☺️

Dementia,On a Lighter Note...Sunday Was Also Dad's Birthday,"I moved across the country and an ocean to help my mom take care of dad who is in the mid-stages. Only to discover that my mom is showing signs as well. The struggle to get her into a doctor is another story. But on Sunday, the stars aligned so that Mother's Day landed on my dad's birthday. 

It was a long day of trying to keep these two on track. At some point, we had a 15-minute convo on it *not* being Father's Day and *not* mom's birthday. We had to clarify why dad got a cake and mom got flowers. We sang happy birthday to both of them. My dad thanked my wife profusely for grilling steaks for Father's Day. My mom kept asking how old she was. Every time we got things sorted about what day it was, dad would wish my mom happy Mother's Day and my mom would wish him a happy birthday. I had an eye twitch by the end of the day, but it was still pretty funny.","Gotta appreciate the little things 😂
Good for you! Actually, that sounds like a hysterically good time. Definitely one for the memory books!
Thats awesome, thanks for the laugh!",2022-05-11 12:03:45,writergeek,und8pc
Dementia,"My wife comes from a family that consistently develops dementia later in life. Her paternal grandma had it along with her great aunts. Her father and uncle now have it. She doesn’t have symptoms yet, but will probably when she’s older. Anyone know of any studies looking for participants like her?",,"I knew nothing about dementia before I started down this path with my wife in 2016. At the time she was 55, senior level executive, and still brilliant.

Doctors kept saying nothing was wrong, so for the next three years I aggressively tried to discover ways to get her diagnosed. 

Alzheimers.gov has clinical research trial finder. I think I signed my wife up for three or four registries, that are probably interconnected. When I would find out about an interesting trial and reach out to the coordinators, they would always direct me back to the registry. We live 45 minutes from Johns Hopkins and received zero interest in her being part of any study. 

I would definitely have your wife’s dna tested. What I have been told and what I can tell as an outsider looking in, there is a lot more demand for individuals with dementia genes in the early diagnosis studies.
This is a great question! Hope someone answers
The National Institute on Aging has set up a network of Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. Find one nearest to you and contact them.

https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-research-centers
Google ""how to participate in dementia research.""  nih.gov and alz.org are both good.  

I work with Parkinsons, so I know more about that, but should pertain to your wife's situation as well.  

Some studies she has to make doctor visits, others she/you can do online. 

One area of research is gene testing, looking to see what genes contribute or cause.  Or figuring out why some people who have known genes don't develop it (what ""turns on"" or deactivates certain genes-- called epigentics).

Others try giving drugs early to see if they can stop progression. My Parkinsons friend did these studies and is so far progressing much more slowly.  

Others look at certain types if exercise to see if they're more helpful, etc.
Would be helpful to know what country/location you’re in.
I would be interested in this too, since everyone in my family has or has had dementia, and I fear I will develop it later in life.
I’m actually taking part in a brain study research project.

I just want to say as someone with a family history of dementia I’m grateful for the studies they are doing and the medications that are available now. My family probably wouldn’t qualify for studies but I’m glad they are happening. My fathers dementia experience has not been as horrible as his fathers was.

Dementia,Mom has covid. Paxlovid?,"Mom, 75, dementia mid-late stage, otherwise physically very healthy, has tested positive for covid. I have it too and she lives w me part time. I’m waiting for a callback from her doctor about getting her Paxlovid. She’s had all vaccines and both boosters. Last booster was about a month ago. 
Any advice regarding Paxlovid? She’s also on lexapro, olanzapine and Escaltopram (sp?), vit B and C.","I use drugs.com to research interactions, side effects and so forth.  That gives me some information to then have a conversation with the doctors.
Not a doctor but I was married to someone in the medical industry and often found myself at dinners with pharmacists. Those people know their stuff - and are well versed in drug interactions. When my infant son kept getting a mystery rash now and then and we couldn’t figure out why, I mentioned it to my pharmacist who asked if i gave him cherry or grape Tylenol. Turns out, I kept the cherry Tylenol in the diaper bag and rarely used it. My son was allergic to the red dye. I’ve called them two other times, both late at night on a Sunday but I always preface it with … Look, I know you’re not a doctor and I’ve got a call into the pediatrician but this is what’s happening … is there any kind of otc remedy that might help until we get to the doctor.

Dementia,MIL driving me a little nuts,"My mother-in-law was recently diagnosed with dementia. It is on the mild side… But there definitely are areas where she has issues with language, reasoning, judgment, and rational thinking. We’ve noticed this for a while but it was just recently diagnosed. I recently had a baby and she comes over every week to spend time with the baby. I feel like it’s really important so I feel like I’ve encouraged it. I think the family is appreciative of it. I’m having surgery and I feel that it’s OK for her to be with me to try to take care of the baby since I’ll be watching her and guiding her the whole way. I have to have this surgery asap.

Sometimes I get a little frustrated though because I feel like it’s become opposite in the sense that I’m now the caretaker. I guess it feels a little weird because it’s not really my mom but I’m the one who ends up spending most the time with her. Is it bad that I’m really upset she’s gonna be here for many weeks? It’s really hard to hold a conversation and I feel like it takes a lot of effort for me to keep her engaged. I feel bad because I don’t want to seem like I’m being rude but I really am dreading the time she’ll spend with us. Unfortunately, I’m not working and with one of us just working it’s really difficult for us to pay for help. I guess it’ll be OK… Since I’ll be here, and the dementia is pretty mild.

Anyone else ever get a little frustrated? I feel so drained after I see her…almost like I’m babysitting her.","You are ""babysitting"" and it does get frustrating. I don't know your whole family dynamics but it doesn't seem unreasonable for you to tell others in your family that recovering from surgery, taking care of a baby, and managing/supervising your MIL is a bit much and that you need help.  Maybe have someone take her for a few days at least.
Yup. Absolutely, I feel you. If you have decided that providing her care is important for her and your family, even if it is motivated by the lack that f financial resources, then, be sure to take care of yourself. Realize all the feels are valid and normal. Then do your best. Many states offer aging services to low income folks through what is call a Medicaid waiver. There may be support to help ensure her needs are met to alleviate some of the care giving burden and care coordination to help think about things you may not have thought about.",2022-05-11 09:03:33,Few-Restaurant7922,un9d6e
Dementia,A guy lost in the woods,"I live in a sparse, forested subdivision of the Rocky Mountains.  Around 10:30 pm, I heard a guy yelling for help somewhere in the woods outside my house.  I yelled back and eventually found the guy at the vacant property next door. The guy had gotten lost when darkness fell sooner than he'd expected. He could tell me his address, but he couldn't figure out how to get to the road about ten feet away or how to use his cell phone. As I drove him a country mile home, he told me he had dimentia. I walked him to his door, and he pounded on it for about ten minutes until his wife answered. They are both pretty old, they don't have family in the area , and I am worried for the guy in particular. His wife may not be able to take care of him to the extent he needs it. They don't exactly live in the remote forest, but it is the Rockies and it is the woods. Night gets really cold, and the environment or its inhabitants can kill. I don't want the guy to get lost and die if this happens again. I called the sheriff's department, and they were not too helpful in providing assistance beyond a single welfare check..  Who can I speak with to make sure these folks are receiving the care and attention they need?","In your county or state do you have an Adult Protective Services? They’re tied to a Dept of Social and health services. If you do make a report, a social worker may investigate and follow up for more info. I had to utilize resources when I reported an incident at my moms nursing home.
You’re a good person. You’ll get better results if you post in a sub related to your province or state
Suggest to the wife to put locks he cant open on the doors that lead outside. It's a sad but necessary precaution with dementia. It's called wandering, and they can do it anytime of day or night.

Dementia,Delusions without memory loss: is this dementia? What kind might it be?,"This post pertains to my grandfather, who is in his late 90s. He hasn't been thoroughly examined on this, but he appears to have some sort of dementia.

He has not had memory loss, hasn't forgotten anyone or any incident in his life, nor does he experience any issues with communication. He sometimes has lapses in working memory about whether he ate breakfast, etc, but other times he will remember these things correctly. He's sometimes confused about the day and year, but he's in the ball park (he doesn't keep a calendar or anything).

But over the past few years, he has developed a host of fantastical delusions which are getting progressively more detailed and consuming.

Some seems stem from his religion; he believes that people in a religious realm tell him facts about his family. For instance, he'll say we need to go get his mother or uncle from outside - it's not that he has forgotten they ever died, he just believes that they're here again after being sent back from that afterlife realm. Others are non-religious; he believes that foreign dignitaries greet him and converse with him, that family members have now become actors or sports stars.

He spends much of the day alone in conversation with beings/people he perceives to be present. But he realizes we can't see them and thinks he has special access to seeing them.

What conditions would be consistent with delusions without much memory loss? If dementia, which specific types match up with this?","When I first read the title I thought Lewy Body dementia but his awareness, and the atypical subjects of his hallucinations make me question mental health issue or a brain tumor impairing specific brain regions. He should get a good neurologist involved in his care. Sadly, many doctors see a patient for 15 minutes and then slap a “dementia” diagnosis without looking at other biological factors. I work in the dementia care industry at a corporate level and I often push for families to advocate to their doctors to get a proper diagnosis so we can support. That type of dementia I mentioned earlier, for example, has terrible interactions with antipsychotic medication but these drugs are commonly used to “treat” dementia.
Is he distressed by all of this?  If not, and he is happily delusional, I guess I’d leave it be.  For someone in his late 90’s, there is unlikely to be much by way of treatment so I’d advocate for addressing this by  being as much in his world as is possible and realistic.
Hm...the fact that your grandfather is aware that he's the only one that can see these people and that no one else can suggests to me that this might not necessarily be dementia? Also if he still has good working memory, particular short term memory, this doesn't seem typical of dementia. Having said that, if his behaviors are become concerning, especially if he begins to endanger himself (wandering outside for example), a consultation with his physician or a neurologist might be in order.

Dementia,What plans are you making for your own future as a result of dementia caregiving?,"Watching my mother-in-law decline and bearing the burden of her care has been extremely exhausting and eye-opening - and she has a lot more financial & family caregiving resources than my childless partner and I will at her age. We’re starting to think about creating living wills dictating DNR, comfort care only at a certain point and whatever else we can think of so neither of us have to do this again for each other a few decades from now. 

Have you made plans and documents like this? If so, what do they consist of?","I have a DNR. My adult children know my wishes.  I have a stash of RX meds that should I need to, I can go that route.
Yes. My husband and I both have DNRs and living wills. Comfort care only. 

We also have agreements between the two of us. If one of us is diagnosed with something we don't want to live with we have plans. 

Like hiking on the ocean cliffs that are notorious for rogue waves that sweep people out to sea. Or deciding to try heroin. Basically, anything that would result in death but the other spouse could never be considered a suspect for it.

It's tough because we live in a right-to-die state but people die long, painful deaths because of all the red tape.
I have a DNR as well as no food water etc.  BUT, I also know my children could over rule that so I will opt to kill myself if I am ever diagnosed.  I am taking care of my husband of 48 years, who was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago.  My life is basically over as it is dedicated to taking care of him.  All of our plans gone, poof.  Yep, will not be a burden to my children and honestly am not the least bit interested in staying in a body with a brain which no longer functions.
I have an advanced directive but intend to consult a lawyer at some point to see what other more robust options might be available to me (the advanced directive paperwork explicitly says it is not a DNR). I'd like to be able to follow through with assisted suicide if I'm ever diagnosed. There's an organization in Switzerland called Dignitas that assists with this (if you're curious, the book In Love by Amy Bloom details the legal and emotional journey she and her husband went on to be able to do this). I don't have kids, don't know if I will, but I can't stand the idea of my theoretical kids or my real husband having to take care of me this way, all while slowly losing ""me."" It's endlessly frustrating to me that people who have likely never had to care for someone with dementia get to decide what we're allowed to do with our own lives. I get that there are absolutely ethical concerns here and no one wants blood on their hands, but it's literally impossible to do this in the US. There is no amount of legal wrangling I could engage in if I didn't have 6 months or less to live, and of course by then it's far too late for someone with dementia.
Having a good friend or family member have medical and financial power of attorney is key.  Why?  Mom made extensive plans for her own dementia future.  We so respected and admired her awareness and planning.  She had been through it with her own mother, after all.    

Then when dementia got to the point where she needed assisted living, she denied she needed help.  She insisted she could still drive, though her doctor contacted the RMV to revoke her license.  Luckily, my sister had POA, so we were able to get her the care she needs over her objections.  

The point is, when you have dementia, you don't know how incompetent you are.  It's a gradual decline, so you don't notice the changes and to you everything is normal and fine.  You need a trusted person who will make the call for you that you can no longer live independently.
I haven't had time! Except to start legal papers so that if I go first (unlikely), she gets my estate in a trust so it doesn't nuke her Medicaid.
I'd say put something in place for meds to help keep under control, not violent, angry, or even agitated.

The life my mother has when she is not on the meds is so distressing to her, and at what cost? She's not even actually lucid, and she just gets more upset that she can't go home.

It's brutal!

Dementia,Just a vent. Dementia (we think with LB),"After 3 weeks in the Hospital, my grandfather (who had been delusional/hallucinating and aggressive for the entire time there) improved. 

His heart stuff is back under control(Afib, tachycardia) . He was walking again a little (when he's confused his legs stop working completely).

 He didn't just improve, his mental faculties came back completely with Seroquel. He was himself again in a way that I hadn't dared to ever hope for. For 5 days. He was sent to rehab from the hospital on day 2 of having cognitive function and was fine... until today.

This morning he woke up thinking that he was home, but was supposed to be at the job he retired from like 19 years ago. He's not back to being aggressive or abusive yet, but I know it's coming, since he's been kind of a jerk for most of his life anyway (just not to family) and the dementia has made it so much worse.

I just... I needed to vent. We had him back and watching him start to lose himself all over again is almost enough to break me.

Everything has been on and off since February when his symptoms started with hallucinations/delusions that came and went, but those last 3 weeks in the hospital were pure hell. I know it was stupid to hope for a real recovery, but we'd thought that the Seroquel they put him on might buy us more time when he showed such a big improvement and now everything looks so bleak again.

They want to send him home next Tuesday, and he wants to go home, but home isn't safe. He's his own POA though and would never let anyone else have it willingly. We're working on a guardianship, but if he's functional on the day of the hearing it could go either way. 

So, I guess we'll probably be back at the hospital for a new round of torture by next Wed, because he still thinks he can walk, to the point where he will physically fight anyone trying to tell him he can't... and his legs still aren't going to hold him when his other symptoms are active.","Hallucinations and delusions during a hospital stay are quite frequent in the elderly.

I'm sorry he's not doing well again :( , what was he in the hospital for? Perhaps an infection had re emerged affecting his cognition. 

 A 3 week hospital stay would also commonly lead to gait difficulty but this can hopefully be improved with PT if he can return to baseline cognitively.
My dad has gotten hospital-induced delusions every time he’s been there for the last 3 years (call it 4-5 times, usually just one or two nights).  After the last time, when he had to be put in restraints, we enrolled him in a palliative care program which was committed to avoiding hospital at almost all costs.  Now that he is in memory care, I suppose it is more likely that they will call 911 than had he been at home (we were to call the palliative care team).",2022-05-10 15:30:19,Suspicious_red,umqnj3
Dementia,Rapid cognitive decline with no diagnosis,"We live in rural vermont so dont have access to the best doctors as I assume, if youre really good at just about anything, why would you stay in vermont to do it. This is regarding my gfs father (52m)

Anyways hes gad all the scans, blood draws, imaging, lumbar punctures, etc. He was admitted to UVM hospital for 4 or 5 days for constant testing and monitoring with the hopes of gaining a diagnosis. Nothing

 Hes had a few older (>10 years) TBIs, they seemingly have ruled out most everything with testing but his cognition contunues to RAPIDLY decline. His cognitive abilities seem directly correlative to his stress levels. He remembers the most random shit, but also forgets how to use the smartphone hes had for years. He hasnt begun forgetting about people. His father also recently started rapdily declining and he constantly is asking if his father is even alive because he cant remember.

How common is it to be unable to receive any sort of diagnosis? Is this just due to not having "" good enough"" medical team and that if he were put in the #1 neurology hospital in the world that they would be able to find a diagnosis? Or is this common. He has stage 1 bladder cancer too, and were getting DRAINED trying to financially take care of him. SSI denied him as stage 1 cancer isnt a valud reason to receive disability i guess, at the time of the first SSI application his cognitive decline wasnt as severe as it is now and I dont think was noted in the application. My gf and i have only just now taken over his care from his gf. I'm lost as what to do while we wait for the current SSI appeal to come back. The hospital visit netter us multiple pieces of official paperwork saying he cant be left alone and cant work/hold a job. Weve never done anything like this before. This is driving me into a dark place, not being able to help, watching him decline, and being financially drained doing it all.

Tl;dr is it common to be unable to receive a diagnosis for rapid cognitive decline and how hard is it to use rapid cognitive decline without a diagnosis as a basis for long term medicaid/Medicare (whichever one pays for a in home caretakee) and SSI/Disability. Also if anyone has doctor suggestions anywhere in new england that would be appreciated.","Step 1. Contact the social services department in your county.   There is a ton of paperwork and absolute nightmare to navigate through this they should be able to point you in the right direction.   Step 2  For SSI/SSD you will probably need an attorney.   There are a number of them that specialize in SSI//SSD approvals.   Did your gfs father have Covid?
It's probably much easier said than done but any chance you can get referrals from your docs to something in Boston/Cambridge? I know they're crawling with hotshot doctors. 

It may not (likely not) be Alzheimers, but you could perhaps contact https://www.alz.org/, 800.272.3900, to find out where/to whom he can be referred. They have some help for other forms of dementia, too. I'd especially mention the TBI's. 

Be aware that everyone seems to have long wait-lists for appointments.
Delirium can be caused by bladder cancer but I would have thought if it were delirium the hospital would have figured that out.
Delirium can cause dementia-like symptoms with a steep cognitive decline. Depending on what is causing the delirium...if this is even delirium...it may/may not be reversible, and some recover fully, but not all.

Bladder cancer can cause delirium, but again, not always. My uncle passed away from bladder cancer in 2018. He was diagnosed in March, and passed away in September. He was cognitive and with it up until 1-2 days before he passed.

Have they checked and ruled out infections of ALL types? Even UTIs and things like pneumonia can cause delirium in those of advanced age. Even smaller infections can cause cognitive changes. My father had delirium so bad from the spine infections he had, it was like an instant flip of a switch for him to go from his ""normal"" to severe dementia-like symptoms in a couple hours. He's been treated for the infections (which required surgery), so he has improved a lot...but he's one of the ones where the delirium did NOT go all the way away, and he is now actually diagnosed dementia.

There are various things that can cause delirium. [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326684](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326684) Maybe check out this article and see what his Dr has/has not ruled out?
I’ve have been going back and fourth with doctors for a while trying to get everything processed and to get everything recognized by the us government. It takes a while and is a pain in the ass. Stay strong
Why do you think he has issues with remembering how to use his smart phone?

Is his memory of his father affected by his rapid decline?

My mom doesn't have dementia, but she has had the phone issue, before, also. I have schizophrenia, and sometimes, we are affected by the other person's issues in a cognitive sense, also.",2022-05-10 14:00:48,texastache,umopwx
Dementia,Dad moving to nursing home from residential home. I'm very emotional.,"I'm in the UK. The local council let us know that my dad should actually be in a nursing home instead of a residential home. We visited the nursing home yesterday and seeing so many patients lying in their beds, mouths open and ready to die was something I was absolutely not prepared for. It's very different to a residential home and it hit me hard that my dad is actually dying and he has no hope of getting better. I think deep down I'd hoped it wasn't the right diagnosis because he remembers us and he is very aware of what is going on. He isn't as bad as they are and I worry that the environment will make him deteriorate rapidly.

We never got on but when he got diagnosed last year, he changed into the dad I wanted so I feel like I only really had him in my life properly for a year. It makes me want to have him back home and get a nurse to come in and change and bathe him. My mum doesn't want that and said I would find it very difficult having to do this. I want to spend time with him but not at the nursing home. I don't think I could ever go there again. It was traumatic. She wants him to go to the nursing home as they are better equipped than the current home and they feed them properly, let them go outside etc. She said if it was her, she would want to be in the best place for her.

I don't know what to do. I definitely need a therapist for this but I'm not sure if I could ever cope with visiting the nursing home.

How do you cope with accepting that this is it for your loved one? How do you cope seeing all of the patients completely out of it and ready to die?

Thanks.","Yesterday I was negotiating with the doctor to let my mom be sent to my house because I have an extra room and I work from home but after my mother wasn't willing to even stand on two feet for me I decided that the nursing home was the only option. Now I'm going to spend the next two weeks researching the best nursing homes and insurance to cover it so hopefully I can come up with the best solution... Not much else one can do in this situation unfortunately.
Sorry this is happening and I understand a similar pain. My dad's personality, humor, and intelligence were intact even as the rest of the signs were showing up. I looked around the memory care unit and there were plenty of the one's who seemed barely conscious, slumped over in their wheelchairs, parked in front of a TV. I could tell the fear and frustration in my dad's eyes as he didn't understand what was happening and why. He definitely deserved a better ending than he is having, but of course, they all do. That said, his Alzheimer's showed up in his inability to take care of himself, especially in going to the bathroom. He would convince himself that he had diarrhea and commence to trying to free it with his fingers making a complete mess of himself and the bathroom, and he would not recognize what he was doing at all. So, he was not open mouthed and drooling, but he was definitely where he needed to be.

It was hard to see him in that setting, but eventually I was able to accept that it was the new norm for him. I just focused on enjoying what parts were left. Currently, he is losing his ability to communicate, so I spend a lot of time just agreeing with whatever he is trying to say. I am lucky that he still recognizes me and we still can exchange hugs and I love yous.
>How do you cope with accepting that this is it for your loved one?

it's not a choice. life decides to unfold the way it wants to, we can either give up and accept this reality, or haunt ourselves.
We are about to put our mom in a care center. 
Granted, it is because we are at the end of our wit but also because she and your father deserve professionnal help.",2022-05-10 09:26:02,PalmTreePhilosophy,umioq2
Dementia,Father with dementia confusing my life experiences with his own.,"TL;DR: Items from my past makes my dad talk about those things as if they're from his past. 

I tried goggling to see if I could find anything about this but didn't have much luck. 

My father has early to mid stage dementia and is definitely acting more strange as the days go on. 

I have found that when telling stories he tends to say things from my past as if they were his own memories. 

For example he took me to karate when I was a kid and when moving home he was helping me with some boxes. Anything vaguely Karate related from those days caused him to stop in his tracks and talk about how he used to do it and that the training equipment was good stuff of his. 

Has anyone had any experience with a relative acting like that? 

It's not distressing so I don't correct him. It's just been happening more often with other things so I'm just curious if it's part of a bigger behaviour that could be forming. 

I think he remmebers taking me to the lessons but the lines are being blurred as to what his role in those memories are.","This and similar things happen a lot with my grandma, I think it's pretty common. 

I believe it is indeed best not to correct them, unless it becomes somehow dangerous to them or the people around.
Heh. Yeah. It happens.

The dementia sufferer knows something is wrong, and their brain is not working properly. So when they get an idea to stick in their head, they fixate on it.

And that's fine.

They have no ability to plan ahead. They often have short-term memory loss. And old memories can begin getting fuzzy and falling away, too.

All they really have is RIGHT NOW. This very moment.

You are doing the right thing by just playing along with them. It is harmless, helps them feel ""normal-ish"", and have a conversation with their loved one on their terms.

Your only role at this point is to help them have every moment of connection and happiness you can give them. If they want to talk about the invisible person in the room, or their new partner they are dating (who doesn't exist), or if they co-opt your memories and share them as their own... no harm done. Just roll with it. Let them tell the story and have the moment of connection.

That's love.
My Mom, who is living with me for the moment, told me today she was just talking to her sewing group a week ago and told them she was driving down to visit me. She was living in NY and now lives with me in SC. 

Fact is she was in a nursing home in NY (from hospital) due to Wernicke’s/Kossoff Syndrome and I picked her up, bringing her down to my house. She’s been here since late February and in hospital/nursing home since November 2021. I just nod and smile. 

She told me on Mothers Day she “hoped my Jennifer will call me” and I informed her that I was her Jennifer. She looked shocked and said she didn’t know that before. SMH!
I have not experienced too much of false memories but it is also my Grandma so the amount of our lives that were entwined was very small. 
But she definitely thinks things belong to her that do not. Clothes can be a bit of a funny one considering she definitely can't fit in my clothes. But she will be convinced it is her coat that she was given when it is mine. It does not happen very often but we pretty much just smile and nod and then take whatever is ours back later.
lol I have experience with that!! I'm studying Classics at my university (so Ancient Greece and Rome) and my dad always tells me he learned both languages at his university (what I'm doing now) and since I have an interest in archaeology, he always brags about going to Greece and doing field work and handling artifacts - but he always insists that he took a bus with some classmates from Canada to Greece. Funny thing is, his degree isn't related to that field at all. 

No harm, but sometimes amusing!
Basically as the dementia sets in it creates gaps in their memory, so their brain does its best to fill those gaps in with whatever scraps of memory it can find - your dad must recall something to do with karate/kickboxing, but his brain didn't get it entirely correct.
My mum believed something my aunt told her was her memory.  She just couldn’t shake it, so I ended up Agreeing.
My mom saw pictures my sister posted on Facebook of a boating trip and then my mom thought it was her trip. Told me all about how she boated down the Hudson River! Lol.
My mother-in-law was a very talented seamstress/tailor. I had some basket chairs that had worn silk upholstery. She helped me re-do them by making slipcovers for the backs of the chairs from material I bought.  I covered the seats using the same material and upholstery nails. I had enough material left over to do the seats on the kitchen counter bar stools.  The basket chairs are long gone but we still have the bar stools.  At least once a week the will run her hand over the wooden back and say ""I made these chairs!"" 

I get where that came from - she did do something with the same fabric that also involved furniture you sit on.  It's scrambled but you can tell how she got there. She thinks she built furniture? Fine. I'm not even tempted to correct her anymore.

The other day she pointed to a set of glasses I inherited from my grandmother, who got them before WWII, and said, ""I picked out those glasses and I bought them. Aren't they pretty?  I'm glad I bought them.""  I had to stop myself from saying anything other than ""yup, they're beautiful. Good choice.""

We live in their world. They have moved out of ours.
Yes, it is pretty common, my grandma has sometimes thought she's done something that we only talked about doing.  She can't remember what she's done yesterday a lot of the time anyway, so if she remembers any part of a conversation about, I dunno, going to the zoo or mall or something, she thinks she remembers it because she actually did it, if that makes sense.
It’s called confabulation. My husband always wanted to go to Egypt and when I asked him about international travel, he said he had been there. He hasn’t. 

He tells me that’s he’s seen movies that he couldn’t have seen, like they were just released. Alternatively, he will happily watch a movie he’s already seen because he doesn’t remember seeing it. 

I know there are many techniques to deal with this but I’ll have to admit that I find it frustrating if he refuses to watch a movie he’s “already seen” if it’s one I want to watch.
So very common,, thier memories get all scrambled up.    Just for how bad they get scrambled... I am a girl
So at 11pm last night mom came to my bedroom  and said
Since your dad is not come home do you want to have sex with me
😒🤨🤮😣😖😓😫😥😥😥😥
I've had that happen as well. Or, experiences of my younger brother were his experiences.

He once told me he grew up in the small rural town where his grandparents lived. He was quite certain that he grew up in that town. In reality, he grew up  in the worst neighborhood of a large town about 20 miles away.
Thank you for all the replys everyone. Seeing other peoples examples have been very informative and reassuring.
I did not realize that this happened in dementia.

Dementia,I don't know what to do,"A year and a half ago my wife fell. She hit her head so hard it bounced. Along with thus, she broke her shoulder and dislocated it. She has always been one to not do anything she didn't like. So the home therapy was pretty hit and miss and the use if her arm and hand has deteriorated. She started  ""misplacing "" wallet, purse, phone, charger, money, underwear, etc. Not a day goes by without  a search being conducted, as sometimes several. She will sob and cry and ask why I would do such a thing as to hide whatever the ite. Is at the moment. She hides these items and then forgets where she put them. Then she yells and screams and uses vulgar language and says terrible things. She never remembers any of her actions. I  called  her dr to setup an appointment for load tests and mentioned my concerns  about her behavior. Finally, after very much persuasion she went to the Dr's. She ended up with the PA who gave the blood test result and wished her a good day. At least that is what she said. I asked if she wanted me with her when she went in and she declined. I made appointments for eye care, follow up on her arm etc and she cancels them. I have to work and worry about what is going on when I am not there. Thanks for listening.","I agree that she needs to see a doctor and get a diagnosis. What you describe sounds like dementia of some sort is a possibility. Here is what I would do. I would call her PCP and ask for a referral to a neurologist. Tell them what you have seen and ask which local neurologist they would recommend. Doing that won’t be a violation of patient privacy since you are telling them things and not the other way around. The only info you are asking for is the name of a neurologist. With luck, they will offer to schedule the appointment for you which could mean an earlier appointment. 

The day of the scheduled appointment, I would take off work, take her out somewhere for breakfast or lunch, and then also go to the doctor. When you arrive at the doctor, let her think she knew about the appointment and forgot. Walk in with her, get her checked in, and when your wife isn’t looking, hand the receptionist a paper listing detailed accounts of some of the behaviors you have witnessed. On the outside of that paper, indicate that this is for the doctor to secretly read before seeing her.  Help your wife complete the new patient forms. Offer to fill it out (which she will likely need help anyway) and when there are places for her to sign, pass the clipboard over to her and point where she needs to sign. She will be unknowingly signing the HIPAA statement saying they can discuss her medical records with you. That’s a little shady to trick your wife into signing, but it’s in her and your best interest. I would have no qualms tricking her whatsoever.  

When she is called back to the examination room, just stand up and walk with her like it’s no big deal. Don’t ask if she wants you there. Just go with her. The doctor will already know what you have to say. Doc can ask her questions and as she gives incorrect info, you can give the doctor wide-eyed non-verbal responses such as a small shake of the head to let Doc know she isn’t giving correct info. 

Since you are in the room, you will hear everything said and not have to rely on your wife to tell you what happened. Even if she throws a fit and won’t let you in, she has already signed the privacy agreement saying they can share info with you, so you can now call back later and they will tell you what is going on. 

Best of luck to you. We are here when you need us.
I’m sorry you are going through this. But God bless you for staying with her.  My mother is the one I take care of with dementia, I could not imagine if my spouse was struck by this disease.
Yeah that's a tough one. The thing is hitting your head like that can certainly cause a form of dementia. But there's one type of dementia I can't remember the name it's got to do with swelling on the brain and if they can reverse the swelling then the dementia can be resolved. But you have to get a CAT scan to determine this. And you need to do it soon so maybe lying to her? Don't give up and I know it's hard.
What is your wife's age if I may ask?  Cognitive changes after a fracture occur often in older people and can essentially kick start dementia.  It may be best to see a neurologist and be present during the visit no matter what.
Could she have a TBI from the fall? I know someone who had TBI from brain cancer and the outbursts and behavior sounds similar.",2022-05-10 02:28:25,needy73,umc6pd
Dementia,My mom had to be committed,"I’m 27 and my mom is in early 60’s, she’s shown signs for years. On Saturday she almost smashed the windows and wouldn’t calm down, my dad called the cops. Today she didn’t recognize him and completely destroyed the basement bathroom. My dad dosent think he can take care of her and had her committed. She had been begging me to not let her go to a place like that all my life. Even weeks ago. I feel like a failure, I feel like I let her down. I feel like I’m losing him. I don’t know how to feel, today I lost part of me that I will never get back.","You did not fail her. I’m trying to put it into the correct words, but the person doing these things isn’t your mother.  It’s the disease. I know in my heart if she was coherent she would tell you that in no way shape or form have you failed her
OP, don’t feel guilty at all. Over 3 years ago, I had to commit both of my parents to a nursing home for dementia. Both of them were suspectible to wandering, not taking their meds, and a few other odd behaviors.

You did the right thing. Elder care is very draining and affects you in many ways.
OP, hang in there. As mentioned by another poster, it’s something that I tell myself all the time: This is now the disease that’s in control, not your mom. And when you will need to lie to her to calm her or make her compliant, that’s also the disease that you’re lying to.

You have no good options ahead of you, just less bad ones. 

I put my mother in assisted living in October, and every time I see her, she asks when she’s going home. I tell her “as soon as I can”. She recently had to be admitted to a hospital for a psych eval, as the assisted living facility couldn’t calm her paranoid delusions. 

It’s crappy, but all you can do is the best you can. Be sure to take care of yourself during all of this, as it can easily consume every minute of your day.
I'm so sorry - please don't feel like a failure.  You didn't fail either one of them.  There comes a point in this disease where they need professional help.  Help that we are not trained to provide.  By getting her into a facility, you are actually giving her back some dignity in a disease that takes every last shred of it.  My mom is now clean & well fed.  She lives in a room that doesn't look like it belongs to a hoarder.  \*\*Hugs\*\*  You are doing the right thing by getting her the help she desperately needs.
My Mom is Super Defensive and won't take direction now that she has Dementia. The doctor says that paranoia often takes hold the further along they are with the disease.
If she were ""healthy"" and saw another family having the same situation as you guys do now, she'd understand this completely. 

I do home visits for patients with dementia, trying to aid them with every daily life tasks that a fully functional person would be capable of. But they aren't fully functional and many of them - even with a family at home - need to be committed to some sort of a house in order for them to get the best help with those who have education in this field. 

Your father is a kind human being for taking care of her, you OP are a great son/daughter for being worried of everybody... But this unfortunately is out of you guys' hands already. 

Sounds like the illness has gotten worse. It doesn't help that certain patients have a very horrible insight into their own illness and how damaging it is to everybody around them, including themselves. 

You are not a failure. You would be a failure if you did not give your mum a good care. A house for patients with dementia isn't a bad place. In the country I live, we have activities to activate their memories, their senses, to rehabilitate their functions so that they can still enjoy life like that usually would before the illness. 

Good luck to you all. She'll come to terms with this at some point. Good luck.
I’m so sorry to hear that. Don’t blame yourself, there really aren’t many options you have when someone with dementia gets violent like that. Taking care of someone that has no idea who you even are from day to day is draining and nearly impossible

I’m a similar age to you and am having to come to terms with my dad having to go to a nursing home. He never got violent, but he would have never wanted to live through his dementia as feeble and unable to speak or care for himself. Dementia has sealed his fate, the man I knew who would have done himself in no longer exists.

All we can do is reflect on our memories of them. The people we once knew no longer exist, it’s definitely not an easy thing to come to terms with.
Your mum, in her lucid moments, wouldn't want to worry you or to make you feel scared or upset. She's lucky to have you and there's very little else to be done. 

Wishing you love and hugs.
You have NOT failed her. As someone else said...this is the disease, and NOT her. But, given the disease, how it has progressed, and how it has changed her behavior...you are doing what is BEST for her. She needs to be somewhere she can be kept safe, where they have staff that are trained and have experience caring individuals who have this condition, and they have care around the clock 24/7.

And by doing what is best for you, you are also doing what is best for her. You are family, and her advocate. You are protecting and keeping yourselves safe...so you can be there and advocate for her. The person she used to be...NOT what the disease has turned her into...would NOT want to hurt you or cause the damage she has. She would want you to be safe, too.

I have promised my father that I would do everything I can to keep him out of a nursing home...and that the ONLY reason I would ever seek placement in a facility was if his dementia progressed to a point where he became a danger (physically/mentally) to my son (his only grandson)...and he agreed with that. My son is his little buddy, he dotes over him...and he would be horrified if he ever hurt him.
you're not letting anyone down man, you're doing what's best for your mother. you guys need help and that's what you did. I'm 27 and lost my mom to dementia in March. so I feel you, it's a lot but being there for them and doing what they need done is important. feel free to hmu if you need anyone to speak with.
I just went through this exact situation with my mom. It fuckin sucks and you feel guilty but know that you did the best thing for her and your dad.  Keep ur head up dirty Dan

Dementia,Rant: Sometimes it feels like I'm living life backwards,"21 years old and I feel like I'm caring for a child. Packing a bag when we leave the house, keeping bottles filled, preparing food, the list is endless. When this disease is out of my hands and we have no choice but to put him in assisted living, I will have my freedom back. 

I will never have kid and do not want them, but I feel like a mother every morning when I wake up to when I go to bed. Dishes, laundry, shopping. I can not wait to live my life (selfishly) and never return to this stage by never having kids.","I hear you. All the work of motherhood and none of the joy. You don't get to watch them being cute or getting smarter or learning new skills. You're just there to clean up the mess.
I'm in a similar position. I am turning forty, without kids, and have been taking care of my Mom to some degree over the past five to ten years and after two weeks in the hospital recently due to her refusal to eat, she will be checked into a nursing home tomorrow. It makes it a bit worse hearing my Dad, her ex-husband of fifteen years, tell me that the reason Mom wanted to keep me (didn't get an abortion) is so she would have someone to take care of her when she got older... 

None of this burden was my choice but even so, I'm not going to let my Mom suffer as she deals with the debilitating effects of this disease.
consider assisted living now. having to anul your own life is NOT an act of love towards a parent. Being 21 and being unable to live life is NOT what any loving parent in good health would want. There is nothing selfish about you wanting to unfold into your own person. 21 is so young, and this is so unfair into you. Do not wait until you are going insane to think about assisted living, do it as soon as you can.
I’d move ahead with assisted living. You’re not bamboozling a healthy person into getting locked up. You’re lovingly providing your Dad with the care that he needs. Do not feel guilty.
Had kids. Loved it. (YMMV, of course.)

Not loving this. Yes, same sort of responsibility for them, but they don't learn and they don't grow and there's no... future. 

But I'm somewhat resigned to this. It's a Good Thing to do, I suppose.
First off, OP, you aren't selfish and don't let anyone tell you (or buy into) that opting out of kids is selfish. You know what's best for you. 

I got out of a very rough marriage and moved right into caregiving.  No kids here either and after feeling like I had to twist myself around to appease my ex- and now to care for my mom, I'm pretty done with not having a full life of my own. I think it's a normal way to feel.  Many people would call us empathetic for caring for loved ones, and we are, but I can guess that there are many of us (myself included) who, if given the choice, will NEVER be caregivers ever again. We are still empathetic if we consider our own needs and health.

On a day when you have the head space for it, see if you can find an elder care attorney or social worker that can help you.  You deserve to live your life
I hear you. It's like caring for a toddler with a severe thyroid condition.
Having raised three children and now caring for my grandmother with dementia, I can tell you that those are completely different experiences. Yes, raising kids is hard and exhausting, but there is a much better support system (even in the US) and a general positive attitude in society. The kids themselves grow and change in positive ways and are the sources of much joy along the way.  So I wouldn't equate having children with eldercare -- other than losing some types of freedom for some time period, they have very little in common.

If there is any way you can find an assisted living option, do it, this is not what life should be for any extended amount of time, and you are just starting out!",2022-05-09 23:20:36,moonlightmile1234,um910w
Dementia,Dementia at 30?,"Hi there!

I'm a 30-year-old, and I'm wondering if/terrified that I'm starting to develop dementia:

- completely forgot someone's name for ten or so seconds.  Known them for years
- feel like I'm in a haze all the time
- spaced out more time than not
- trouble reading; feel like my brain shuts down half-way through any sentence

I've talked to my doc about this, and she's inclined to believe it's my anxiety and depression, but after several years of unexplained and unaddressed symptoms, I'm starting to reach out to others a bit. 

I have no history of dementia, though my grandma had trouble recalling the correct names for many years for no given reason. 

I've had a CT, blood work, and a urine test, none of them through neuro, and all seemed to come back clear. 

What'cha think?  Something serious or mental illness running amok?

Edit:

Forgot to mention, I also have no family history of any diseases that cause dementia.",">I'm a diagnosed hypochondriac

Hmm, so, there's your answer.
The irony of this is that assuming the worst despite there being the possibility of there being more likely and less severe causes is textbook Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I have ADHD and anxiety and your bullet points pretty much describe a day ending in y for me. 

Is your doc a therapist or psychiatrist? If not, It sounds like some consistent therapy would be a good step to try at this point.
In my experience, people with dementia are not the ones that diagnose themselves. Again, only my experience, but self awareness of one’s decline is atypical.

Sorta like the saying that only crazy people think they are sane…
There are many medical reasons for this. Definitely keep digging. Dementia is far less likely than something like MS, thyroid problems, or even ADHD
Sounds like ADHD or thyroid. Dementia is dad nor than brain fog and forgetfulness…more like repeating yourself constantly and forgetting the steps to something like making a cup of coffee.
Get a calcium and PTH blood test, make sure it isn’t your parathyroid. Look up hyperparathyoidism, see if symptoms fit.
Fibromyalgia also causes this which is what I have. And a whole lot of other things can cause brain fog. Burnout can cause brain fog
For the record, the youngest person to ever be diagnosed with dementia was 36. It is incredibly unlikely that you have that.
ADHD? I went through the same fear and realised that the older i got the worse my memory seemed to become, but then i got diagnosed with ADHD.
Did you have covid? A lot of people have reported a type of brain fog that can last months afterwards. Otherwise say it sounds more like side effects of depression and anxiety. I had severe depression years ago in uni. I'd read the same paragraph over and over and over and not retain anything. I couldn't focus enough to even follow a basic tv show plot or conversation.
Dementia is not likely. There are other causes of the brain fog in addition to the causes you listed. I had massive brain fog and depression. It was an outcome of leaky gut syndrome. I encourage you to see an integrated physician or natural path. Brain gut connection is not widely known in western medicine.
I feel this often. I also work with the population and it makes it 10x worse because sometimes my days are so chaotic. I am on Zoloft and it helps me so much relax
I've always had those symptoms and finally got diagnosed with adhd inattentive type after my teen daughter was diagnosed.  Maybe you should get assessed.  Have you always had issues focusing?  Tendency to daydream etc?  Issues at school and work?
It is EXTREMELY uncommon, like < .0001%
Here for ya! Btw if you’re interested in finding more professional help you might check out clinical trials for dementia. Hope my referral code helps https://www.withpower.com/go/tevb/clinical-trials/dementia?referralBonus=BustlingCow
No bro you don't. You have anxiety and worry too much like I did at your age. For me I swore I was developing schizophrenia because I had uncles on both sides of the family that had it with much of the same symptoms your having. 

It's just an anxiety disorder, get healthy, eat right, exercise, sleep right, get checked for sleep apnea and your life will get better - if your still depressed and or anxious after about a year and your doing all that get on some meds for about a year and no more to reboot your brain then get off the meds.  This is what helped me get over anxiety, I still have anxious episodes but it's completely manageable now.
A lot of people experience some memory issues without having dementia.

It is unlikely that what you have is dementia.",2022-05-09 22:26:18,TheFakeZzig,um7yxm
Dementia,I had to turn off the breaker to the oven,Can I vent? My mom kept pressing the off button on the oven (even though she doesn't cook or use the oven) to the point that it broke the panel and it constantly beeped. I had to turn it off at the breaker. We no longer have an oven. I'm at my breaking point. I don't have anymore tears.,"I'm sorry.  It's all so hard.  The good news is that a control panel is a fairly easy repair on most stoves.
We care in house for my wife's grandmother who is now bed-ridden w final stage, but before when she was up and and around, we hade to flip breaker on cook top and oven and told her they were broken.  When we renovated kitchen, I added a new gas cook top and installed a hidden timer solenoid switch to activate gas.  This way she couldn't start cook top.
Yeah my dad's taking out my toaster and my microwave in the same way. I expect them to quit any day.
My loved one has personal animus towards the air conditioning and is wrecking the controls.....

I hear ya
I did too, but in our case it was because she would put something in the oven on broil, then forget about it for 24 hours or more.  It’s a wonder she didn’t burn her place down.

I also had to put a locked plastic box around the thermostat so she’s stop turning on the heat by mistake—in a Texas summer.
So sorry you are going through this.  We had to start turning off our circuit breaker to keep our mom from fiddling with the oven/stove….all so sad.
I’m sorry :( you’re doing wonderful I know it’s hard
I’m sorry you’re going through this. Taking care of adult toddlers becomes exhausting. Sending you a cyber hug for strength
(Giggles.) Mine broke 2 garbage disposals, a dishwasher, 2 vacuum cleaners, tore 2 passenger side mirrors off the car, ran a stop sign & lead the po-po on a slo-mo chase before pulling over, forgot how to call an Uber on her cell so I had to summon one while attending my dying father 1000+ miles away… all before she was diagnosed. Got a head start, she did!
I hear you. We have child locks on the laundry room door and the dishwasher (so far); also someone watching her almost constantly (99-year-old grandma who's lived with my family since 2000). She has worked all her life, and her dementia makes it impossible to realize that she's no longer capable. It's tough to be positive about any of this; when I have the energy, I look at each new problem as another puzzle -- how do I keep her out of trouble without being ""mean"" (in her view, we are punishing her for no reason -- she thinks she's completely independent and able to do everything she decides to do).",2022-05-09 11:47:57,beepbop21,ulu7ow
Dementia,Chewing pills instead of swallowing,"I’m hoping someone can offer me help with this. My mother takes pills three times a day. It’s always a hassle, but the worst part is that she chews them instead of swallowing them, and then she wants to spit everything out because it taste horrible. 

Anyone have any ideas on how to get her to swallow them? I wish I could roll them up in a treat like I do for my dogs, but I don’t think that’ll work.

Thanks!","Applesauce, pudding, yogurt… My mother-in-law has Alzheimer’s and she literally will chew water that she’s drinking.
That’s tough. I can’t think of anything off the top of my head except possibly using a compounding pharmacy to make gummy or liquid suspension of the drugs she needs. But insurance often won’t cover it. :( I hope you find a solution soon.
Have to be careful about this though as crushing may put meds in your bloodstream faster than intended and then levels are not consistent throughout the day. Most of these dementia meds are intended to keep levels of chemicals consistent in the brain. It might not matter with whatever your mom is taking, but its worth a conversation with her doctor to make sure. Some meds can be taken as an ointment or a patch to assist with this.
If the meds are not time release, crush the pills in a pill crusher and mix them in apple sauce.  Worked for my wife.  With capsules, open the capsule (most come apart quite easily) and mix the powder in apple sauce.  Pharmacists usually know more about these things then doctors so you may want to check with your pharmacist.
Apple sauce!
My mom started doing this before refusing them completely, only she had no problem swallowing them. I'd check in with your pharmacy to see if there's any liquids you can get them switched to, or even see if there's any evaluations that can be made to limit her dependency on them (obviously this is totally dependent on your mom's needs, and no situation is one size fits all). Something else you can look into is taking a syringe, put the pill inside, fill up with some water, cover the tip with your finger, and pull the plunger down forcefully so that it shoots back up a bit (without removing it completely) a few times, it dissolves the pill. Though I would check with her doctor first to make sure there isn’t an issue with dissolving for administering it.
Crush them up into yoghurt or soup?
What's worked for me sometimes (because, let's face it, nothing works 100% of the time) is putting the pills into a spoonful of berry jam - blueberry is great - because my mom won't chew it, she'll just swallow it. And the fact that blueberry jam has small lumps of blueberry in it means that the small lump of pill goes unnoticed. If she chews the jam, well - how about ice cream? (Maybe choc chip, again so there are lumps?) Most of us don't chew ice cream because it's way too cold for our teeth, so maybe that would work for your mom.

We've also started crushing one of her pills up into her morning cereal - we checked to make sure that it wasn't a time-release pill or anything where crushing would be a *bad* idea. My dad uses a garlic press for the crushing, just a tip if you want to do things cheap! :) But this only works because those pills are pretty much tasteless - the evening pills, the ones I put in jam, are intensely bitter, and even mixing them into pudding requires wayyyy too much pudding if you actually want to mask the taste. 

If you want to make sure she can't taste the bitter even if she's not chewing them, we've found that cake glaze\* sprayed onto the pills (2 coats) does the trick 100%. My mom used to *hate* these pills but now she's mostly willing to take them because the cake glaze covers the bitterness enough that they're now tasteless. 

\*Thank you to the Great British Baking Show, which my mom loves watching, for this inspiration. I was watching them glaze a cake with it and thought HEY! Maybe that'll work for the pills! (We tried things sold as actual pill coatings but that wasn't nearly as effective as cake glaze!)
I see suggestions - I'd also just check that none of her meds are time release. Chewing them up could affect that.
Mortar and pestle them, then mix them into yogurt or apple sauce. Ezpz. As someone said in this post that it may not delay as it's supposed to, unfortunately you have nearly no way to make her take them without her either chewing them anyway, choking, gagging, or spitting them out. So at this point, in her struggle, if they help her, perhaps give her half crushed, and give the other half later crushed.
Thank you everyone for such wonderful suggestions! We’re definitely going to try some out. I didn’t know that there could be liquid medicine options.
We put the pills straight into applesauce or yogurt, no crushing. She swallowed them whole. When she needed liquid morphine that tasted bitter, we put a glob of honey on a spoon, injected the liquid med in the middle, and topped it off with more honey. She still wasn't thrilled about the taste but she didn't spit it out
Have her (1) take a bite of food, (2) chew it up and get ready to swallow but don't, then (3) toss the pills in and swallow it all at once like it's all food. 10/10 figuring this out changed my life
Maybe put them in her mouth and immediately give her a smoothie or milkshake to drink so she swallows them?
I feel this. My dad stopped comprehending how pills worked after a certain point. I've literally spent HOURS sitting there trying to get him to understand the process for long enough to get the pills down his gullet. (He was so paranoid and had a remarkably good memory for someone who didn't understand how pills worked, so if we crushed any, he'd notice something was different, conclude we were trying to hurt him, and refuse to take or eat anything.) Still, every patient is different, and if your mom would react better, I second (third? fourth?) emptying or crushing them and adding them to soft, sweet foods. Run it by the doctor/pharmacist first to make sure the meds are OK to be crushed.

Or, comedy option, just give her pill pockets. Maybe chicken-flavored?
Ask doctors which are okay to be crushed. You can hide them in any number of things, preserves are a favorite for me because it also masks the texture where as pudding doesn't and apple sauce often isn't sweet enough.",2022-05-09 09:46:41,Xellossthecutie,ulrmo1
Dementia,Not so happy Mother’s Day,"This is just a rant and I (24/F) need y’all to just tell me to stay strong because days like this just fuel my desire to finally move out and abandon my mother (63) with no resources. 

My mother and I have never had a close relationship. She has made no effort to learn about who I am as a person and that’s how our connection has been since birth. However, I am viewed as my mother way to success. My mother was diagnosed with FTD in December after a very long journey to getting an official diagnosis. I have spent countless hours at doctors appointments and filling out paperwork and righting her wrongs, I feel like a mother this year but I took my mother out for dinner today because she spends 95% of her time inside and she needs fresh air. 

She took full advantage of the opportunity and I regret it. She ordered two glasses of wine when I’ve made it my duty to keep the apartment alcohol free due to doctors orders. She ordered a entree, complained about it, practically inhaled it, then ordered the appetizer version of a pasta dish. She also trash talked my boyfriend during this dinner and spoke nonstop about an imaginary person who she has fixated on for about 3 years now. At only point to just put a pause to the monotony I initiated a revolving conversation and acted clueless to what she was saying but that got boring quickly. My mother then ordered dessert and complained but scarfed it down. 

I regret showing her the drinks menu. The car ride home was torture. I put the music on blast to drown her voice but she just yelled over the music and accused me of so much, insulted me and my boyfriend, and threatened to call her brother. I thought about swerving and crashing and killing us both. Once I got home I pretended that I was going into the house so she would leave the car but I got back in and drove to McDonald’s and ordered ice cream. I just needed space.","Do it. Move out. 


I’m staying with an aunt who has developed dementia but she never had kids. My worst Mother’s Day ever.
Dementia does suck. I’m sorry you have to go through that, no one should. Make sure to keep reminding yourself that it’s okay to take a break sometimes as it can get super overwhelming. 

If she can live relatively normal on her own I’d recommend moving out if that’s what you want to do. That way you can still progress your life and not have her feeling like a burden on you. You can also get a carer to come out and check on her/spend time with her/ take her out if you don’t feel safe leaving her on her own all the time.
move out. ruining your own life won't cure her.
Hi. My Mom passed away in 2020 from dementia related complications and I’ve been thru some similar experiences. I have the retrospective perspective now that Mom has been gone and fwiw, I personally wish that I had just let my Mom nutter on about nonsense with a less grievous response from me. I wish I could have just let her have her two glasses of beer on the one occasion she wanted that. Etc. For me, in the final analysis I see that I could have just been more duck like and let the “water” polluted tho it may have been pour over me with a shrug. At the very end of her life, her last word to me was a very strained “love” because thru it all - her many imperfections and mine - I did love her in my way and she loved me. Hope that helps a tad and bless you.
I think your mother will remember that dinner as one of the most enjoyable Mother's Day dinners in her life, the way you wrote it up!
I’m sorry you had such a rough Mother’s Day yesterday. Your mother is still young at 63. 
Follow your heart on whatever you need to do to have inner peace. It could be a decade or more like my mother so far. 

My mom has later stage dementia.
I called to wish her a happy day and she didn’t know who I was for the first time. We FaceTimed and it was sad to hear her ask my sister who I was. She could have been having a bad day. 

I feel bad for anyone who has a family member with this horrible disease. It’s always something changing and it’s usually not something good.",2022-05-08 23:32:43,x3vicky,ulia5o
Dementia,Tell me about your experience finding in home care.,"My mom has early onset Alzheimer’s and it is no longer safe for her to be left home alone. She enjoys lots of things, but can no longer do those things without assistance. How did you go about finding in home care? (My dad, sister and I need to keep our jobs to provide for ourselves and our families, so we cannot be with her in the daytime Monday-Friday)","We found a well-reviewed local caregiving agency and asked them for a few references. They've been great so far. We were in a really tight spot with extreme burnout coinciding with my MIL getting a bad UTI and her needs dramatically increasing overnight. They made sure we were covered 24/7 even when somebody called in sick. I feel like my partner would have checked into a psychiatric unit for a complete mental health breakdown if they didn't come through for us. We are realizing however that if her needs remain this extreme we need to place her in a facility soon.
I would also recommend interviewing at least 3 providers, even if from same agency. One candidate learned my mom had a cat, and that it would need to be locked in a separate room when she was there. Settled on one who had no issues with the cat, and provided loving care for my mom, fixing meals, putting together puzzles, and really made my mom’s last few months as good as they could be.
You have to set ground rules and enforce them; don't let ppl come back if you feel uneasy. Take a week off and supervise, then put cameras in everywhere.
How old is she?
Can you afford private care? Is she on Medicaid? Try your local department of aging..they may provide resources that your mom might qualify for depending on her financial situation
I went through and spoke with several agencies and found one that was locally owned and the owner actually spoke to me personally. They kept sending different caretakers and I finally found one that made my mom laugh. That's pretty tough most days. The problem is weekend care. The agency has yet to find me someone that will come consistently. It's hard to keep consistent weekend help.",2022-05-08 20:05:22,ReallyReegs,uleo8d
Dementia,How to get my Mom to allow me to cut her nails?,The nurses are saying they won't cut her nails and my Mom ***says*** she is against me cutting them although the length is obviously bothering her. I believe my Mom's resistance isn't genuine. Is there a creative way to convince my Mom to allow me to cut them?,"Would she like to have her nails painted?  I used to work in a LTC facility and every few weeks some volunteers would come in and give manicures for those that wanted it.  Phrasing it like ""can we give your nails a trim so they can be polished and look all pretty?"" might be motivating for her.
Are you asking her? Don’t. Say “ok, time to trim our nails”. Cut yours too if you can. File them if she’s happier with that. 

My husband isn’t in a MC facility yet and I take him for mani/pedis.
I work in enrichment in an LTC. Helping residents with hand hygiene is something I do every day. here's some tips!

1. Spa day. Start with some lotion/hand massage and get her talking and see if you can sneak in a file or some clippers while she's distracted. If she's warmed up to your touch with the lotion she might not notice. 


2. Give her a nail file and ask if she wants to do it herself. This helps sometimes with my residents who don't like being told what to do, it gives them an opportunity to ask you for help


3. If you have someone else who your mom knows and recognizes (or even if you can convince a caregiver to sit with you), sometimes it helps to just have another person there while you clip them 


4. If she is extremely averse to clippers, just use a file. Remember that the goal is to get them shorter and I always say even if it takes twice as long bc the resident will only stand a file it's better that their nails are short and clean. 


5. Don't be afraid to do one hand at a time or even a few fingers at a time. Remember to assure her that you're not going to hurt her and you're not mad at her if she startles away from the clipping. 

Also, it's weird that the nurses won't help. Nail and hand care is one of the most important aspects of sanitation and hygiene in dementia patients, they should at the very least be keeping the nails clean and free of dirt and BM underneath them. Are there any CNAs or even enrichment workers around who can aid you when you visit?
Same issue with my uncle. Its 50/50 on what might work for him. Like others have said phrasing it differently might help. I try the sweet talk approach and watch my uncle's moods to see if it's a appropriate time or if he'll be receptive to me. I compliment his hands by saying you have very nice looking hands may I file this nail a bit to make it look better also helps to get his attention on the tv or music as a distraction while I work quickly on his nails. It doesn't always work so I try again later. I hope things work out for the best❤
I found whenever I had to do stuff like this, I would tell my dad “Dr X says he scheduled this for you” and somehow he would feel that was ok. As long as the Dr says do it, then he would.
The spa manicure set up route is the way to go. If it doesn't work the first time then try it again the next. 1 out of 10 attempts may actually be successful. If not then it is what it is I'm sorry to say. 

If her facility has a ""temperature regulated"" towel/blanket warmer it may help her to relax a little. Either to cuddle up with around the neck and shoulders or to warm her hands with while attempting to clip her nails. Every memory care environment should have one IMO. They are invaluable in aiding people to feel settled.
I found that going to the nail salon or hair salon she would let them do what they needed to I dk why the change in scenery made a difference. If she got agitated the plan was always to abort mission but never needed to. Go speak to the nail tech first I found some that were familiar with the situation and were super gentle and kind.
Going to a third party for a faux “manicure/pedicure” might help her behave.

Our local senior center does toenail cutting - reservations required. Your Mom’s primary Dr can also cut her nails, but it may need to be a separate scheduled appointment.
Offer candy
Sometimes they'll let a professional do exactly the same thing as we want to do. The foot care nurse will do mom's fingernails when needed, and there's never any argument there.
I know this sounds stupid, but I remember hearing about mothers who would put a large coin into their baby's hand so that the child would be distracted while they did it. Not meaning to demean your mother, but it might work 💗🌵
My mom didn't want to cut hers either. I finally told her that either she would have to let me cut them or I was taking her to the doctor's office to have them done. That was enough to convince her to let me do them.  The nails and bathing and changing clothes are a constant struggle.",2022-05-08 18:16:43,RedPulse,ulcnm8
Dementia,How.,Please someone explain to me how to ever be happy again watching my mom disappear. It’s getting bad.,"There is never any joy in losing the ones you love, whether it is in pieces, or all at once.  All I can say is that we need to find the joys that remain, for what ever time that maybe.

Find those times and try and create the best new memories you are able to.
it comes and goes. it really is hard and the near constant grief feels suffocating at times. i’m sorry you and your mother are going through this
It's horrible. I'm so sorry. I can totally relate! My mom is in stage 5 and tells me all the time how much she misses her mother. I always tell her that I miss mine too. She told me she hated me yesterday because I made her change into clean clothes.

I am sorry for your loss. It is a horrible disease and journey. Happiness is not contingent on one person. Find the journey that gives your tools to experience the joys and sorrows of life without being handicapped by the sorrows. Sending hugs.
I’m so sorry. I’m in the same boat. It’s like I’m not allowed to grieve because she is still alive, but the shell of a person in front of me is not my mom. I’m trying to find small moments and create memories with her and my kids, but I don’t know how to be fully happy when I’m with her.",2022-05-08 17:43:33,No_Detective_2317,ulc029
Dementia,Not sure of anything,"Forgoing structure to try and make a concise point. 
I’ve been caring for my dad since august 2021. He was found laying on the side of the road, didn’t know who he was/thought people had picked up his house and moved it. Completely insane when I got the call. He has never/will not see a doctor of any sort. He is a lifelong abusive alcoholic with extreme paranoia. Some days he can barely speak, sometimes it’s only gibberish. He has said he’s faking it and that is the belief. I’m not allowed visitors or to leave the house. If I break the rules (trying to go to work, which he says is a cult trying to divide the family) there is constant harassment. He treats the house like a warden and goes through my things often, “looking for clues”. He might flip all the lights on at 4am, yelling at me that I’m hiding people in the house to harm him. He has mentioned “I’m going to walk that dog to the middle of the highway for how it treats me” because my sweet 13 year old border collie is frightened of him and his yelling. Constant harassment at home to the point where I had to leave my job. Sometimes he thinks I’m an intruder. He smashes windows with tire irons and has destroyed two doors. He can’t use any of the appliances (pretty sure this is fake as well). Does not use soap to wash dishes. Weekly falls resulting in ambulance calls, but he jumps right up when he finds out they are arriving. Hospice has been out multiple times and witnessed how verbally aggressive he becomes, but he refuses treatment and they say they can’t make him do anything until he hit/harms someone. He hasn’t showered in 9 months at least and has recently begun shitting himself. The entire house smells of feces. He smells horrendous. Everyday is a nightmare and I’m the only person involved. He has always been psychologically abusive and it’s becoming insane. He needs to be put away but when I call for help he turns it around and stops everything until the doctors leave, then the insanity doubles to punish me. I left my career, city, friends, everything because I was tricked into coming here, now I’m broke and stuck in a small town with no way out. The feces is the final straw for me, but I don’t know what to do.","OP, I am so sorry you are living through this hell.

You probably should leave, take the dog. Don’t let him know where you are. Reach out to a trusted friend from the city you came from. 

You are not under any obligation to be abused by this person. You can’t help someone who doesn’t want or believe he needs help. 

When he becomes a danger to himself or others you can step back in if you want, once the authorities sorts him out with resources. 

Aside from that, you can contact a lawyer and see if he can be made a ward of the state or given a minder to oversee his health and welfare. 

Good luck OP.
I am so sorry you're going through this. 

You have gone so far beyond what anyone could expect, and you are putting your own health (mental *and* physical) as well as your pet's well-being on the line. 

**It is ok to leave**. 

Reach out to your local domestic violence shelter. Some shelters have pet accommodations, or volunteers willing to temporarily house a pet while its person gets out of a bad situation. Ask them for help. You are being abused, this is domestic abuse, and it is *good* and *right* to protect *yourself*. 

Your father has made a lifetime of choices that have made him into who he is now. He is not a victim in this, in any way, shape, or form. Yes, he didn't choose to have dementia, but he did choose to be abusive, ruin relationships, be manipulative, and so on. Dementia doesn't take away any of that - it seems to have increased some of it, in fact - and while you can see that he needs care, **so do you**. And you deserve it *at least as much as he does.* 

No, you don't need the same kind of care. But you *need* to be in a place where you feel safe. Where you can leave the house, and work, and be yourself. Where your dog can relax.  

He's tried to maneuver you into a position where you cannot leave, but there is almost always a way. There are domestic violence shelters (I don't know your gender but any DV advocate is *absolutely* aware that it affects all genders, and they should have resources available for everyone). There are personal networks. There are friends, and friends of friends. Maybe even just acquaintances or a concerned neighbor. Heck, someone in Edinburgh managed to get out of an abusive situation via the local reddit sub. Reach out to any- and everyone you can think of. Shit, DM me and I'll do what I can to help, even if it's not much. 

Maybe start by reaching out to the [Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/). They do online chats and also texting, not just phone calls, so your dad won't hear you, and if you can access the internet you can access them. Ask them for help, for local resources, or just ask them to listen. 

And when you have decided to leave, *do not tell your father until you are actually gone*. He'll try to sabotage any attempt you make to get out, so do not let him know what you are doing until you are done and out of his reach. 

You're incredibly strong to have gotten this far in the face of this. Now use that strength for the ones who really need it: You, and your dog. 

Good luck and I'll be thinking of you.
Sounds like you need to reach out to your area’s chapter of social workers for the elderly. They can help you get the ball rolling on getting him into an assisted living place. If finances are an issue they can help you navigate Medicaid which will likely cover some or all. Hospice is for people who are actively dying, which is usually a call made by a doctor.
Put up cameras and videotape him, or just leave him to his own devices.  Sooner or later the authorities will get tired of him and do something about it.",2022-05-08 15:45:47,ShivrenColes,ul9j7q
Dementia,Is it easier to just leave them to it in the early stages?,"My Dad (75) is a hoarder.

I’m pregnant with my first baby but since last year I’ve been noticing a decline in my Dad’s memory.

He cannot remember why last year he removed bricks/ pavers and dug a trench around his back porch.

It’s Autumn here in Australia, the rain will start soon.

He’s spent a couple of days filling in the trench with bricks because he’s expecting a shed to be delivered (the people that removed his old asbestos shed removed all his hoarded boxes onto the verandah). Him having a new shed is probably not the solution to his issues when he has a good verandah to store things on.

Anyway, he has a lot of junk on the path he’s trying to extend. He’s using a rope etc to put the pavers back in a relatively straight line.

I said, why don’t you just move that stuff away. How long did it it take you to put those in? About five hours? He said yes about that… so he’s going to want to take them out because he doesn’t have good drainage at his house.

The water flows off the roof because a roof maintenance man installed a pipe to get the excess water off the roof (I pointed out in 2019 that he had mould on his ceiling). I can’t remember if I just found the roof maintenance person off Gumtree or he found them. He says he has his number somewhere and that’s why he hasn’t put a drain or anything in yet….. it’s like this with so many things that need to get done in the house. He has not got much chance of finding this man’s phone number.

He says it will be in his phone somewhere (he doesn’t know how to save numbers though I’ve showed him many times), he might have the card somewhere in his house but he is a hoarder and he won’t ever find this.

He won’t ever get a new tradesman, he always wants the one that came before but he can’t organise a way to keep their contact details.

Anyway, should I just leave him to it. I feel sorry for him spending the day doing pointless things. It makes me so frustrated because I see his house getting neglected, it’s like he’s always looking for an excuse to not deal with it.

He recently bought an Apple laptop (MacBook), he got locked out when he first tried to set it up. I helped him contact Apple and they sorted it out over the space of a week which involved him taking it in to the store twice.

He’s been paying a phone bill since 2015 for a number he wasn’t using.

He had an ancestry account that charged him $100 per year or something that had information he could have found on Google.

He is getting a shed to put his boxes in, but he doesn’t know what’s in the boxes.

He literally has two spare rooms in his house if he wanted to store things in them he could just throw out some of the rubbish.

He gets very rude and angry and I find it so draining to deal with.

He can’t remember conversations we had a few weeks ago. He’ll remember things he accuses me of doing that aren’t true though, like he says I broke his door when it wasn’t me.

It makes me sad having him in my life, but I know I’ll regret it and I can’t let him just be alone all the time.

My brother doesn’t help - he dropped off lots of junk when he moved states - some shelves - now my Dad ordered a shed to use the shelves. My brother also dropped off a boat he didn’t leave covered, this has happened before and the boat (my Dad’s) got damaged because they both don’t look after it. My Dad can’t use the boat because it hurts his back, so it’s just like my brother’s boat now.

My brother doesn’t help. He just doesn’t worry about it or talk to my Dad much.","Sounds exactly like my dad! Don't get too worked up about the stuff is my advice. Life is too short to worry about junk. You have a new baby coming so congratulations! Don't let worry about your father take that joy from you. Hoarders hoard and that's what they do. I moved my dad in with me when he couldn't take care of himself anymore and I opened my cabinets to find bags full of empty plastic bottles and little bits of trash that he stored away. At first I got really irritated that he was turning my house into a tumble down trash pit like his own house, but then I realized there's really nothing I can do about it so I leave him a few cupboards to stuff and throw out the rest when he's not looking. I know there are days coming when it will be beyond his capacity to do this sort of thing so just try to cherish the good moments and let the rest go by.
""He’ll remember things he accuses me of doing that aren’t true though, like he says I broke his door when it wasn’t me.""

Oddly, my mom does this, also, sometimes, although I don't think she has dementia, but schizophrenia, like me, also.

We have, sometimes, had similar delusions, and when I entered psychosis, mom's mental health was affected, too, deteriorating rapidly. I think she might have been affected before I was, but I was unable to notice certain things that she did as odd, pre-SZ.

We have reminded each other of different people. Both of us have looked at the other and saw my father (and her ex), as well as my sister.

I have wondered about hoarding a bit, recently, since someone stole appliances from mom, and both my memory and hers, also, were affected by this - at least, our memories of the objects themselves. Do hoarders instinctively fear something like this happening to them, if they let go of objects?",2022-05-08 10:51:34,Ilovetacos2022,ul3db8
Dementia,For my future self,"Since my recent FTD diagnosis, I have found a whole lot of information, most of it relating to caretakers of dementia, As it should be since caretakers are the ones that have to carry the brunt of this. But I’m hoping to find if other patients out there who want to talk about some things, such as planning for the future beyond just the usual DNR’s and living wills. 

I feel like there is a lot that I can be doing now to support my future. For instance, I see that dementia patients always seem to have a dislike and almost a fear of bathing, and a video on YouTube says to try to make the bathroom as inviting as possible. Pale colors, calming candles, (fake) fabrics, beautiful colors of towels, aroma therapy, etc. Things like that. I want to see if others have ideas like this and we could kind of help each other while we still can.","I took a caregiver class.  Know there are lawyers that can help with financial planning. If remembering correctly, if you have to go to a care facility and your assets are drawn down you go on Medicaid. Know that your spouse gets to keep the house and car.  So you can if you can afford it, put money into house improvements that will increase the value of the house, and buy a nice car. There is also the option of divorce just to protect assets. Talking to a lawyer who specializes in that is best. 

The teacher also stressed numerous times to get help physically, but also emotionally.  He repeated this over and over. Alzheimer’s Association has support groups for caregivers that really help, especially with tips and things to expect. They also have classes (online) and a 24/7 support line for support and info. It’s 800-272-3900. Good to put in your contacts!

Great info on the bathroom!
There is a dementia directive. It is in addition to a living will. As a caretaker of my husband who has Lewy Body, I plan on filling it out. 

https://dementia-directive.org/

I just spent an hour getting my husband shaved and in the shower and I’m exhausted. 

I wonder if assembling photo albums with large pictures of your closest family and friends would help? I’ve labeled his clothing drawers but it doesn’t help - I think I’ll have to start laying out his clothing. 

I think my husband feels useless around the house. It’s hard though, I’ve bought a whiteboard and made lists. I’ll give him a task but he gets distracted or only half finishes it. I’m not quite sure how to handle this. 

I highly recommend buying an adjustable bed. It doesn’t have to be a hospital bed. That’s helped my husband a lot. He has sleep apnea but won’t use a CPAP.
You are so much braver than i am. I would make sure my affairs are in order and I would take my life. I do mot want my daughter to deal with it.  Good luck on your journey.
It’s really brave of you to be thinking about this.

What’s your current home setup? Are there stairs? Must you drive in order to leave the house and actually go anywhere?

Moving a assisted living, or at least a disability-accessible condo or 1-story house near a downtown walkable core would be ideal. While  your brain is still able to form new muscle memory. 

Consider getting an apple watch, have family set up themselves as emergency contacts, and getting in the habit of wearing it daily. The newer ones have fall detectors. If you fall, it will alert your contacts. It will also send them your location.
My mother's home has regular bathrooms. They are useless to ppl who can barely walk. The showers should be large walk-in units with safety rails. The toilets should be built so ppl can sit and get back up easily (comfort-height toilets with rails).

Dementia,Selective memory?,"Hey guys,

I live with my step grandmother, who has dementia (we will call her Meredith), and my partner. One thing that I've noticed is her selective memory, specifically around cigarettes. Meredith won't be able to remember the specifics of a conversation from 5 minutes ago, but she can remember exactly where you've hidden stash of cigarettes. However, she does always loses her cigarettes. 

Can anyone explain this? She smokes heavily, maybe it's to do with her dependency on smoking? 

*we hide her cartons in draws and such because otherwise she will lose a packet and then smoke the next one without trying to find the others. It becomes very expensive.","Dementia is weird as hell.  My dad became obsessed with going on car rides and his truck  after he no longer was allowed to drive. He might not know my mom who has been his wife of sixty something years but he could recall he had a truck and wanted to buy one after we sold his. We waited about a year before we sold the trruck thinking he would  forget driving it but he didn’t. He finally did quit mentioning buying one after he recovered from a sepsis episode and his memory was pretty much gone after that.  He also lost the ability to walk after that illness. So it clearly had cause more brain damage.
There's a quote attributed to Maya Angelou: ""They may forget what you said - but they will never forget how you made them feel."" I think this applies to people with dementia even more so than everyone else. The things my LO holds on to most are things with powerful emotions attached.
My sister had an in-law who was a lifelong smoker.  Suddenly, in the midst of her dementia journey, she forgot that she smoked and never had another cigarette.
My mother didn't know who I was, but she would look at the clock and tell me precisely what time it was.  Memory is weird.",2022-05-08 04:27:47,LurmJurm,ukxbz9
Dementia,Has anyone used a social worker? Was it helpful and what did they help you with?,,"Yes, and we still quote him. My FIL and MIL lived with us for a very brief while. We agonized about placing them in care. My FIL had Alzheimer's, and it turned out my MIL had Parkinson's, sans tremors. 

He told us to start looking at care homes right away and put their names on waiting lists. He said if you wait to do that until it's time, it's too late because it can take a long time for a spot to open up. Too many people try to care for their relative at home, and it gets to an emergency point. The loved one ends up in the ER and they get placed wherever there is an opening. 

He told us it's important you let someone else do the hard work, so you can continue to do the loving without getting burned out. 

He helped us find the right doctor, who got us the right meds.

He gave us direction and support. He was amazing.
Generally speaking, a social worker is like a wise old auntie who's lived through a situation you're in now, has a good idea of ""best practices"" for the problems that are new and baffling to you, and can share what resources in the community you can access to address those problems. 

They glue the fragmented social services together. Like, my partner has dementia, and nobody seems to talk to anyone else: neurologist, psychiatrist, adult daycare, health insurance, Medicaid,, pharmacy, bank, lawyer… Heck, one doesn't even know what the other does, let alone what to ask for. And this is all new to me, so hell if I know where to turn next.
My mom's doctor ""ordered"" a medical social worker for her after my sister and I made a list of our health and safety concerns, since my mom wanted no interference in her life whatsoever despite absolutely needing it. We're in Michigan and it took maybe a couple weeks for him to come out to her house the first time, if that. Medicare paid for it. He counseled us and our mom on POA (something we'd been trying to move forward with for years), brought us advanced directive forms that we just needed to fill out and get witnessed, and administered the Mini Mental State Exam, among more day-to-day stuff. I can't imagine we would have ever gotten financial or medical POA without his help. He was able to question her like, ""if something happened to you, who would you want making decisions for you?"" etc. and that allowed us to get her to an elder law attorney, who talked to her the same way.

&#x200B;

Also, if you're not aware and you're in the US, google your county name and ""area agency on aging."" My local one has tons of low or no-cost resources for seniors and their caregivers.
Where I live there's a 2-4 year waiting list for a state social worker, we had no choice but to go the private route.  Because my mother's legal work wasn't in order (PSA: get power of attorney done) we hired one for $1K within a week we had appointments set up, she also put pressure on her doctor to get shit done, and is dealing with the lawyers for us. She also hand delivers all documents because shit always ends up going missing in the mail or offices.

This person has been a godsend for our family.  I feel for the families that can't afford a social worker or the homes dementia patients have to be in here.  State run homes are 2K a month which have a horrible reputation, and private ones start at 4500 a month.  The sad part is that her home she was so proud to leave behind for us is going to be spent taking care of her own needs for the rest of her life.

So the answer is hell yes, hella helpful.",2022-05-08 01:48:39,WhenTimeswereEasier,ukv7tu

Dementia,Grandfather is convinced he is locked up in a police station and is very angry. How to help with sudden hallucinations?,"Tldr: last two paragraphs for current sitaution. Severe decline in past month. Unable to provide care because not a first world country. Wish I could type everything but the post will only get longer and discouraging to read

He is 92 and lost his wife to covid last year. He was physically able to move with some help but in the past one month his health has gone worse and has shown a very rapid decline in both mental and physical capabilities. 

We have an in house attendant during the day and he takes great care of him. We as a family are also present with him and try to keep him engaged and distracted. 

His mental decline has been too fast for us to handle. Two months ago he started having short term memory loss and would repeatedly ask same questions over and over. He was also confused. Taking him to poo was a hassle but we would manage it. Also started to eat way less than what I would imagine would be healthy for him.

However, last week or two, he pooped in his diapers and refused to get cleaned up. He never urinates or poos in diapers as he is not used to it and doesn't want to accept it but he wears one for emergencies. 3 days of trying to convince him lead to nothing. We also got him a wheelchair so he could move around but he got physically weaker to the point where we couldn't get him to sit on it from the bed. 

We hired an attendant for the day and he somehow didn't resist much to the idea of getting a bathe. Anyways we get him cleaned and back on the bed. But since then he is completely immobile and doesn't even move at all in the bed. 

Where we live it is very hard to take him to a doctor and he is afraid of going to hospitals. Doctors have refused in-home visit and give some covid protocol BS as an excuse. We have been trying to get one for a month. 

Anyways, back to 2-3 days back, he says he is in a lot of physical pain and would fight on any attempt to move him on the bed. He got a huge bed sore on his lower back as a result. We then had to just force ourselves to keep changing his position in bed while he screams and tries to hit us and the attendant because he is scared he will fall down (and the physical pain). He is on a huge double bed and we always try to reassure him and hold him. The attendant did warn us and insisted on us to help with changing his positions but we didn't know any better to deal with his unwillingness to be moved at all.

Anyways, yesterday, we were making some progress with everything. He got up and sat on the bed, had his hair combed, didn't forget much and kept talking. However, later in the day he kept hallucinating and was convinced he is not at home and kept telling me to pack our stuff and that we're going home. I tried distracting him with visuals and music but he didn't give up on this idea. We are also barely able to attend to him at night since it is very hard to sacrifice our sleep and function properly the next day. (The attendant was originally hired to help with tasks like cleaning and feeding which is for the day time.) I believe he has been unable to fall asleep at all in the past 2 days. 

So I wake up the next morning and he is screaming in his room and is talking loudly to the walls. I enter his room and he thinks the police have stolen something from him and also locked him up. He is mad at the hallucinations for not answering to him and letting him leave. I help him to pee and now I am too scared to go back because he is fuming. The attendant will be here soon but I don't know what to do at all.","It sounds like he has an acute issue going on and needs to see a doctor asap.  This would lead to delirium like he is experiencing.

Are his pain complaints new?
Calming peaceful music. Are there any smells he has a good memory of? Like his old favorite cologne, some favorite food (usually sweet)? Can he drink a cup of warm tea? For whatever reason, letting senile patients just hold some object in their hands can calm them, even just like a pair of socks or a handtowel. 

Try not to yell. Don’t tell him he’s wrong. Tell him “I promise I will look into this, and get to the bottom of it” or  “I will figure out what’s going on here” (as I realized English likely isn’t your/his native tongue). 

It helps to postpone his concern. Like “we can’t go home right now, it’s cold, dark, and rainy outside” or “the next train doesn’t leave until tomorrow”. “I know it’s not your home, but is this good enough for tonight?”

Can you get medicine from the pharmacy? Lorazepam is often prescribed for distress and anxiety in dementia patients. Can the doctor prescribe it and send to the pharmacy? Or maybe in your country you can purchase it directly over the counter? Ideally in a liquid form.
He may have a Urinary Tract Infection, which can cause these symptoms suddenly.",2022-05-07 23:09:56,GuyStandingBehindYou,uksutc
Dementia,we bought my mother an animatronic dog and now she thinks it's real.,"Hi all! As the title says, my sister and I bought my mother an animatronic dog for mothers day as a comforting sort of companion for her and she thinks it's real. The dog is especially designed for dementia patients and has pretty good reviews. Normally I wouldn't be too concerned if she were to think it's real, however my father is saying she has become focused on needing to feed it, protect it (she was worried it might fall off the furniture), and was worried it might suffocate when he placed it in the box it came in while they were at dinner. My dad isn't always the best at responding in these situations. He keeps trying to convince her the dog isn't real, that it's  just a toy. I'm thinking we go along with her belief that it's real provided that it doesn't start interfering with her functioning in some way. What do you guys think?","Had a similar experience with my mom and the stuffed animal cat I got her. (Not even animatronic, just your basic stuffed animal.) She thinks he's real, and as a general rule, I think going along with whatever the dementia patient perceives to be ""real"" is the way to go. Mom asks me how my utterly nonexistent kids are? They're fine, doing great! She wants me to pet this cat? Absolutely!   

Unless he wants to keep upsetting her, your dad needs to treat this dog as if he's real. Because to her, he is. 

(And you know, I remember being maybe 5 and someone throwing one of my stuffed animals and I absolutely *wept* at how that must've hurt them. I 100% believed stuffed animals were real, and if I'm honest, part of me still kinda believes that, or wants to believe it. So I have a lot of empathy here, and I don't really see a downside to pretending to be in her reality with her.)  

Like in your case, we ran into trouble when she wanted to feed him and he ""wouldn't eat."" We tried *all* kinds of excuses - ""Oh, he only eats cat food, not people food, that's why he's not taking what you're giving him,"" ""He only eats when no one is watching,"" ""He ate already and he's really full,"" ""Look at him, he's well-nourished, you can see he's not starving,"" you name it, we tried it as an excuse. It'd sort of put her off for a while, but she was still really concerned about him not eating. (Food is 100% her love language. She consistently offers us her food when we're all at the dinner table and have plates full of the exact same food. She offers everyone on video chat her food as well, they've all learned to accept it and say thanks.) 

Eventually the cat's ""not eating"" got really distressing for her and none of our excuses were working, so I said I would take him to my house because I have lots of experience with cats (true - as she was previously aware, one of mine came to me for hospice foster care and is still alive and with me 11 years later), and I would make sure he ate. I took pictures every day of him with my (real) cats, and told her how well he was eating, and how he was playing with my cats, and that made her happy. 

After a few weeks we decided he could come back, and ... it was fine! She wasn't worried about feeding him. Occasionally she'll try to feed him, or the stuffed turtle, and she also tries to feed their very real cat (who thankfully isn't into people food, or he'd probably be a 20-lb cat), but it's no longer an obsession and she's easily distracted from it, so it no longer causes distress, and she loves having this cat around. 

So my advice is,   
1. Accept the dog as ""real."" This is really important. It was really tough for my dad to do as well, because I think it really hits home just how much the dementia has taken over (and that is *way* harder for a partner to deal with than a child), but I think you should emphasize to him that the primary goal is to reduce her suffering and distress, and arguing with her about what's ""real"" and treating the dog like a *thing* instead of an animal is *definitely* going to cause her distress.   
2. Try a variety of excuses as to why he's not eating.   
3. If that doesn't help, then he needs to go to a doggy day care or a vet or a nice house with a big meadow to play in, just for a week or two, so that the specialists can really help with his eating. She will be less distressed by his absence than she will be by him being present and not eating. And given that she already thinks something is going wrong with him, she will likely understand the logic behind taking him to \[the vet / the farm\] for some time.
I’m assuming your mom is in the early stages. I think it is hard for spouses to make the change and play along but, it will be very important for your dad to support anything that brings her comfort. You dont have to go over board and baby your mom but making re assuring comments and asking questions is good. You can also use these moments to connect with reality. Ask her if she had a dog as a kid or tell a story of a dog or a pet.
The point of the dog was to give her something to focus on and comfort her—I don’t see her wanting to feed it a bad thing (get fake dog food in bowls—nothing she can actually eat) and give it a bed or something. The point is so she doesn’t focus on other destructive or possibly dangerous and distressing things/thoughts. I would 100% play along.
Bought my mom a cat.  Best thing ever!  Play along...ever see a kid with a teddy bear?  Same idea.
So interesting to me.  My father will also try to correct my mom, all the time.  Like correcting her will suddenly cure her and she’ll snap out of it.  I do like you.  I play along with whatever she sees.   I don’t see a benefit to correcting her.
Pop needs to sit back and let her believe whatever she wants.  If she thinks it real just play along. The only problem I see is she might try to feed it table scrapes. Buy some cheap dry dog food and toss it out when she thinks her puppy ate.

A big part of taking care of someone with Dementia is letting them have perceived control  of things they hold dear. 

No harm is done and the smiles she makes should be enough to make everyone happy.
Often a wonderful thing, but can be a problem when the person with dementia may want to continually feed or water their ""pet"".  Some go thru the grief process because obviously their pet must be ill or dying.",2022-05-07 23:05:34,_another_number_,uksse9
Dementia,It's hard to believe,"I live in Australia, and my grandmother in England. I used to be able to visit her multiple times a year and noticed a gradual decline. With the covid pandemic, I was unable to see her for almost 3 years.
In which time she's been moved into a care home, phone calls I've noticed a rapid decline in memory and general just knowing what going on.
So 2 weeks ago I was finally able to go over to England and visit.
My grandma and myself have always been super close, but when I saw her she didn't believe it was me. She abused me for interpreting ""her girl"" calling me a snake saying she's going to hit me. I couldn't believe it.
It's so upsetting. I never realised this illness could take the person you love and turn them into whatever this is.
I feel bad but it's time for her to go now, this is not an existence she ever wanted. It's heartbreaking to see her like this.","Very sorry for your loss. It is horrible when her soul has gone but you’re stuck with this angry vestige left behind. 

If you want to give it another shot, you can pretend to be a stranger and just ask her to tell you all *about*her grandkid in third person. You could even offer to help her write a letter to the grandchild.
Seems like covid took her along with many others, just not in the same fashion.
I had a very very similar experience with my grandfather. He and I were so close, shared hundreds of memories and raised me with his passion of cars and motorsports. Towards the end it became so hard to sit down with him and talk to him as his grandson. Towards the end, he was happier to talk to me as a stranger without me implying there was any past relation.
Yes. Dementia, or any memory related illness can really change who we see. Please remember as much as u can of the good times. And for future memories make as many videos as you can. For those days to enjoy the past. 🙂",2022-05-07 22:20:18,bigworldlostgirl,uks1xo
Dementia,This journey is nearing its end,"I joined this sub only recently, though my mother has been declining with Alzheimer’s dementia for some time. It reached a critical point recently. This last Wednesday, the nurses at her facility discovered her unresponsive. There was no stroke or anything obvious from a CT, but it seems like the combination of diabetes and inactivity brought on by Alzheimer’s has led to pulmonary embolism and likely organ failure. I think it’s less a product of dementia than a byproduct of her overall condition. So today, I signed the papers to put my mom on hospice care. It was a tough but easy decision, if you know what I mean. She’s speaking very little, eating even less. I suspect she will be gone within two weeks. I’m sad but resolved.","I’m very sorry, but I also want to say I support your choice. You made the right call to bring in hospice.
I’m sorry to hear that.  Hopefully there will be relief in the life that you two were able to live.
You are on the final journey with her. I hope her passing is peaceful and you hold happy memories in your heart forever. Peace.
I am so sorry that you're going through this with your mom. We had to put my mom in hospice about four months, with two of those inpatient because she just kept hanging on. The hospice staff was so wonderful with her and so supportive. It was the best place for her to be, and I know that when she passed she was free of pain and well cared for. That's really all we ever wanted for her.

I think (even though was not said) its aggressive in the course of a week he has gone from doing okay to shouting in the garden at 2am in the morning. I don't live with my dad but I feel like I'm  struggling processing it all. Any help will be appreciated.,"Have you been able to discuss medications with his doctor? Is your mother still
In the picture? If so, how is she with this? Is she able to calm him down? 
Also, are there any social service agencies that can lend a hand with aides?
I’m also 22 and my mom was diagnosed last year even though I have also known for a long time. It’s really really difficult and for some reason the decline seems to happen at a much faster pace when it’s early onset. 

My mom went from having issues with her speech and comprehension to fully dissociating the majority of the time, hallucinating constantly, and now losing physical aspects as well like walking and fine motor skills in a matter of months 

If you need anything at all, even just to talk about this whole messed up disease with someone who’s young and understands ❤️
I can suggest you learn what type of dementia. There are several different kinds with 4 main types. Even though all progressive some of them have time where one seems worse but then becomes more lucid. Also something as little as a urinary tract infection can cause delirium, which on top of dementia can be very overwhelming but treat the urinary tract infection you're treating the delirium. 
Now keep in mind I'm not a doctor or anything I'm just in the early stages of dementia myself
Sorry you are going through this. Something worth considering Is the impact of other factors on the dementia, some of which may be temporary/cause accelerated symptoms. The fact that he has deteriorated so quickly in a week means this is worth considering.

Primarily, some types of infection can cause a worsening of symptoms. In addition specific vitamin deficiencies like B12 and also lifestyle/environmental factors E.g. poor nutrition, sleep or alcohol.

A comprehensive blood test should rule out the infection and vitamin deficiency. As for the lifestyle elements, good nutrition, exercise and sleep, should always be encouraged.
I'm sorry you have to deal with that at your age. 

My mother has Alzheimer's and is not even 70 years old. Both of her patents died with the desease (84 and 91) and we all expected her to get dementia too. It's still different if the symptoms set in that fast. I felt like Corona had made it worse.

Dementia,Grandad search with grandma who has dementia,"Y’all, so my grandad has been dead for 22 years now and now my grandma has me looking all over the house for him…even in cabinets. I’ll play along not to stress my grandma out but the funny part is the cabinets. My grandad was 6’2”. And I even told her “grand, unless he’s a contortionist, he’s not in a cabinet”🤦🏽‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣. Her response: “we’ll he was good at finding hiding places.”🤷🏽‍♀️","I always told my dad that my mom was at the store or visiting her friend.
Its like that sometimes lol best to have some humor to such a sad,depressing disease.  Thank you for sharing this made me chuckle while being very sympathetic to what you are going through❤
It's the occasional funny moments that keep me from completely losing my mind. Thank you for sharing!
Omg my grandma does this tooooo. You have to laugh so you don't cry. My grandpa was also very tall and she lives in memory care now, and before I left the other day she had me checking in her tiny little bathroom of her 300sqft studio looking for this giant man who's been dead since the 2000s.
I told my dad that his parents were visiting Denver (we live in California).  Not sure why, but this satisfies him for a while.

Edit:  lately he has been stressing that his parents must be angry with him because he has not visited them in so long.  I make up convoluted stories about their travels and assure him that they are not upset at all, just out of town.
I have a different problem. If I lie to my mom about my dad being gone and tell her he is out somewhere then she gets very upset. They did everything together. If I remind her that he has past then she settles down and says things like ""Oh ya I wonder why I forget that sometimes""
(They were together over 60 years and only had a couple times they were apart for a couple days)  
But if this changes at anytime and reminding her starts to upset her I will lie.
My Stepdad died in December while Mom was in rehab. I tried telling her the truth once and she didn’t believe me, then cried, then accused me of lying. Never again. 

Now she asks to call him constantly, which I do and it just rings. Sometimes she tells me she just talked to him, then asks where he’s gone. It’s really maddening. I just reply “I don’t know where he went” or “I haven’t seen him”.

This one isn't bad but I hate the general TikTok genre of ""awareness"" for conditions like dementia and mental illness. It's full of stuff that doesn't treat people with dignity and fishes for attaboys for the caretakers (if they are in fact caretakers).

I’ve taken classes for dementia and they teach that’s the last thing you want to say because if they don’t remember you, then your just confusing them more.

Dementia,What do you think of these symptoms?,"I am a bit scared of these developing symptoms lately:

\- increasing difficulty with communication. I feel like there's a slight disconnection between what I think and what I say.

\- incoherent perception of space. For example, it takes me a while to make sense of space to get back to my seat after going out of the bathroom (a new one that I just discovered) in a coffee shop that I frequent.

\- incorrect time perception. Like a few days ago I mistaken one close national holiday for another that took place 3 months ago. Things that happen long before seem like yesterday, and things that happened yesterday seem so far away.

I didn't do an MRI yet, and the doctor told me that it's sleep, anxiety and depression. While it's true that I always have problems with sleep (the first and the third occurred right after I wake up), I am still worried about this being the onset of dementia.

Could you share some opinions on this?

I am a 28.5M by the way.","Having dementia at your age is extremely rare, like winning the Powerball and Chopped the same week. It's likely some sort of delerium, which can be treated or even cured. See a doctor.
Listen to your doctor. This is not dementia.
I know anxiety can make you think you're losing it and it feeds on itself.

In addition to medication there are foods and supplements that help as well.  And get your bloodwork done to make sure youre not vitamin deficient as that can bring on certain symptoms too.  Good luck!
This isn’t dementia. 
Sleep more and drink fresh mineral water regularly.

Dementia,Safety time limiter for microwave?," I know these exist for stovetop, but is there a device that you can use to limit the time a microwave is used? My mom with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) just put her meatloaf that she's made a million times in the microwave instead of the oven, and only noticed when the smell of something burning horribly became apparent, because she set the microwave to a oven-appropriate amount of time. We're not quite at the ""freaking out"" stage yet, but want to look into devices that would allow her to maintain some independence in the kitchen with less risk.","I think she just showed you that she may not continue to be independent in the kitchen.  My husband placed a crock pot on the burner and turned it on, put an electric kettle on the burner and turned it on, started frying food in a pan and walked away as he forgot he had done so, he is no longer allowed to cook anything.  This is the first sign she should have someone with her when she is in the kitchen. That is probably hard  to face but it is for her safety.",2022-05-07 00:18:39,PurpleVermont,uk5c1b
Dementia,death with dignity (venting),"I'm 22 and my grandpa who raised me has had dementia since I was 13. he's physically healthy but mentally he's completely gone. my little brother and I have been trying to convince my grandma to put him into a nursing home for years, but she refused to do anything insisting he is staying in the house. he needs a nursing home now, and my grandma is finding out that it takes two months or longer to get everything ready to qualify for medicaid. my grandpa has been pissing and shitting all over the house for over a year, and it's destroyed our house. my brother and I don't have time to take care of him being in our early 20's, and my grandma definitely can't take care of him. I havent lived at home for years and my 20 year old brother finally gave up and told my grandma they're on their own 

they are essentially both dying in the house together and yelling and screaming at each other all day. it costs over 10,000 dollars a month where I live to put him in memory care. I can't believe that death with dignity isn't an option for him. today, he was eating his own shit out of a bowl he was eating out of, and pissing himself. I don't want to touch him, I don't even want to talk to my family anymore.

he is miserable, our family is broken, and the house has probably over 30,000 dollars worth of damage. why? so he can't sit in a chair and watch tv for ten more years?  I'm so angry","I’m sorry. Call your local elder abuse line. It will expedite getting him placed somewhere. They should help out both without charging your grandmother with elder abuse.
You mentioned Medicaid so you must be in the United States.  Google the state your grandparents live in and ""adult protective services.""

There will be a phone number you can call to report abuse or neglect of an elder.  That sounds terrible, but you need to call the number.  Your grandpa qualifies for this because your grandma is neglecting to take care of his health right now.  APS will understand that grandma has been doing the best she can, but is in over her head.   Lots of times, family members don't know how to find help.

Your grandma won't be in trouble because she's been doing the best she knows how to do.  APS can help expedite getting him into memory care.  They can also help her apply for Medicaid.   Your grandpa doesn't have to already be on Medicaid to get accepted to a nursing home--the nursing home just wants to know that the family is in the process of applying for it.

If your grandma only speaks Spanish, they will get someone who speaks Spanish to help her.  But it might speed up things if you agree to help with translating.

APS is usually open 24/7, so you don't have to wait for the weekend to call.
It’s okay for you to be angry OP, it’s a awful disease. You are doing the best you can and that’s all you can do. Try to stay strong.
My father in law has been diagnosed too recently and we have been taking care of him at home. Knowing the cost of memory care in this country makes me worry about rest of the family, while we want to provide him dignity and safety.

I am planning to explore other countries which might be cheaper, not sure if any other member on this group has experience with that.

A quick search for Mexico pointed following - https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/assisted-living/mexico
first step with medicaid is schedule an Assessment for a WAIVER with the local agency if you’re doing home care. those have to be scheduled in advance.

If you know he financially qualifies for sure; if he goes to a hospital the social workers at the hospital can push along the Medicaid application. This was how we got my family member’s expedited. you need to say: HE IS NOT SAFE TO LIVE AT HOME 

They should be able to help find a nursing home that can accept him PENDING medicaid meaning they won’t charge him until he gets accepted for medicaid
Even in countries that have death with dignity, you can't just put people down like a pet when *you* decide, they have to be in their right minds to consent to it themselves. 

So it would not be an option for your grandfather anymore.  I'm sure you can see the moral and legal reasons for this.   

I'm sorry about your house and your lives, if he's already been incontinent for over a year though, I  don't think another two months will make a difference.  What you could maybe do in the meantime is talk with his doctor about the level of drugs it will take for him to keep a pair of depends on him and not scream and yell at your grandmother all day.",2022-05-06 17:52:48,82727262828,ujybt5
Dementia,What to do if patient refuses to insert a feeding tube?,"My grandpa has dementia and has been struggling for the past year. hes been in and out of hospitals becos of his heart as well.  a week ago he suffered a stroke. He is partially conscious now and semi awake. His mind is clearly alive but he is struggling to respond and talk. He falls in and out of sleep and has not been eating. Hes been surviving off the IV drip. Without food, its going to be hard for him to survive this time. Because of the stroke, he lost the sbility to swallow. The doctors tried to insert a nasal feeding tube, but hes resisting  because he indicates to us that its too painful when they insert it in. We dont know what option we have left. We cant go into surgery to open his stomach because his heart is too weak. Has anyone had experience with inserting feeding tubes or other alternative ways to get food into their bodies?","Let him go.
Has grandfather ever expressed his wishes in an Advanced Directive or Living Will previously?

Would grandfather want a life where he cannot speak and cannot swallow, and uses a painful feeding tube?

what is the goal here?

It may be time for a consult with hospice. I am very sorry you going through this.
Tbh it may be time to say goodbye. Why make him go through all that if you know the road to recovery is near impossible?
You started off by saying your grandpa has dementia and has been struggling this past year, but then you state ""his mind is very much alive"". What does that mean to you?

His dementia will not get better. The physical issues caused by his stroke could improve with therapy, but the dementia complicates that therapy. If he can't swallow now the only feeding options are a nasogastric tube, very uncomfortable and meant for short term. TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) bypasses his GI tract and goes in through a type of IV. And finally a PEG tube that is surgically placed through his upper abdomen into his stomach and nutrition/feeding can be supplied through a line that goes into the tube. This last option is the best long term solution if he were to not regain his ability to swallow.

Depending on how advanced his dementia is and how serious his heart problems are these may not be appropriate options.

But please don't ask random people on the internet. Ask for a consult with the hospitalist, or his primary doctor, and especially a provider from a palliative care team. Don't talk to surgeons as they will almost always tell you they can surgically fix the problem even if the chances of success are slim.

Palliative/Hospice care can keep your Grandpa comfortable and relatively pain free even if the conditions that are bothering him can't be fixed.

Edit: typo
Since a feeding tube can cause great harm, respect the wishes of your loved one.  And as a nurse, I cannot stress how much the feeding tube can cause issues because there is little science as to how much to give how often and giving too much can cause aspiration pneumonia, fluid overload, and other problems to the point that nursing staff feels the family is torturing their loved one to death making them suffer thinking they are doing good.  It's sad, but please consider accepting their wishes.
It's time to call hospice.  They will help your Grandpa through this.
Best practice: 

Have an illness/accident that you will recover from and have a good quality of life = feeding tube etc 

Have an unrecoverable condition = comfort care only, nothing that prolongs life and or suffering.
If the patient needs a feeding tube due to the progression of the dementia, the feeding tube will only work for a short time if at all. Google dementia and feeding tubes. My mother lost her ability to swallow due to dementia. The next day she began transitioning and went into a coma the day after that. She passed away peacefully 21 days after “forgetting” how to swallow. She was wheelchair bound and hadn’t known me for over a year. I was feeding her by hand. She had a living wheel that specifically mentioned no feeding tubes.
He might be resisting the feeding tube because he doesn't want it.

So your grandpa has a chronic heart condition, dementia, just had a big stroke, is not interested in food and resists a feeding tube.

Sounds to me like it's time to let him go.
[https://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/feeding-tubes-for-people-with-alzheimers/](https://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/feeding-tubes-for-people-with-alzheimers/)
I’ve never heard of an end stage dementia patient going on a feeding tube. Usually they stop eating on their own as the disease progresses and hospice is called in. Hospice prescribes medicine which keeps them comfortable until they pass peacefully.
As I understand it, your grandfather is not late stage dementia and had a stroke that has affected his ability to swallow temporarily or permanently. You mentioned that he still has an active mind and was relatively active before the stroke. He is in much discomfort right now.
First start with palliative care to ease discomfort as much as possible.
Alternative feeding ( tube via nose or stomach or IV) should certainly be offered unless there are advance directives against it that he made) if he is not end stage dementia. 
Having a nasogastric tube inserted  is not pleasant especially for someone confused in hospital after a stroke, but nursing staff may have some methods (small bore tube, sedatives at time of insertion etc). There is such a term ""delirium on dementia"" which temporarily makes dementia worse than it is in acute situations. A nasogastric tube is temporary and either there is an improvement in swallow ability, or a decision to have a tube inserted via the stomach which is permanent or withdraw the tube and see if careful hand feeding is the best way to go. A speech therapist can assist with this decision. 
I'm a geriatric dietitian and have accompanied families at times like this. 
This is such a stressful and confusing time. 
There decisions are best made with family and doctors and staff discussing all options, risks vs benefits, prognosis. 
Bless you all.
When my uncle who had Alzheimer's/Parkinsons, went on feeding tube, he died shortly afterwards. My father who had dementia wasn't eating much, my stepmother said he would probably have to go on feeding tube, my father passed within days of that suggestion. A coworker who's elderly mother died from COVID-19, wasn't eating or couldn't swallow, he talked about feeding tube. She ended up passing before they could put it in. 

Feeding tubes in elderly people sounds like it's near the end, especially for dementia patients.  

I would say, prepare to say your goodbyes. Hold, hug, and kiss your loved one.  Let them know in whatever little consciousness that remains, that they were loved.
It's time for hospice. If he refuses the tube due to discomfort then you shouldn't put it in. They will help manage the pain and may be able to assist with the feeding tube if it is at all possible.
TPN is a nutrient liquid that goes in through a type of IV line. The IV line has to be placed at the hospital by a nurse using a special ultrasound machine. It would ""hurt"" like any other needle stick to draw blood or start an IV, relative to everything else he is going through not much.
It sounds like it is time for him to move on past his suffering. My father is at the very end right now yet every time I go into his room I feel relieved when I see him still breathing. But he will be much better off after the pain and indignity of this terrible disease is over.",2022-05-06 15:00:59,pearliengai,ujumba
Dementia,New here with a question,"Although I have a billion. 😕

In the last year, both my mom (71) and my mom in law (77) have been diagnosed with rapid onset dementia (different types, so we see different behaviors). How our respective fathers handle things is different and I wondered what is best. 

When my mom repeatedly says things that aren’t true, my dad (as well as myself) correct her. When my husbands mom says things that aren’t true, her husband says he “plays along because it is easier for everyone”. I feel like that may be the case, but at the same time I question if that’s detrimental to the person with dementia. 

I am still learning all I can and have minimal support professionally and personally. I hope my questions are okay here. Thanks. 🙂","Your father-in-law is a wise man. As long as going along with what she says isn’t going to put herself or someone else in danger, that is usually the best course of action.
All questions are welcome! 😊

In the really early days I corrected my dad a lot, but I came to realise that it doesn't necessarily help because a) he won't remember it anyways and b) sometimes correcting them can make them feel bad. My mom and I just let him be now. Like Bonnie said, as long as they're not in fear or putting themselves in danger, going along with it just seems like the better option. Sending you some strength !! 💪🏻💓
It depends on the nature/urgency of the incorrect fact in question, the consequences of playing along, and the person’s temperament and mood in that moment, and well as the stage of progression.

if you feel bad about “lying,” then try redirecting or delaying the request somehow.

If she says “I wanna go home”, replying “you are already home” will get you absolutely nowhere and only make her angry and distressed. Whereas “it’s dark and rainy outside right now, let’s have some hot tea for now and go in the morning” that basically postpones the request without saying “no you’re wrong” directly

If the delusion is something very innocuous and uncomplicated to accommodate, just roll with it. 

“you remind me of my granddaughter” (a little child in her mind) —> “Aw, why don’t you tell me about her? What is she like? What’s your favorite memory with her?”

My grandmother had the tragic realization all at once that 1. she hadn’t heard from her parents in a very long time, 2. she herself is 90 already, so mathematically they’re not likely to be alive, 3. she didn’t remember the event of their passing or attending their funerals. So in this case you see it was hard to just go along with what she believed. Because she still had enough sense in another way. She had a sense of time passing and her own lifespan. So we explained that they had passed, showed her photos of the funerals, assured her that everything was carried out properly.
you might want to read the book THE 36 HOUR DAY . It was recommended in a post I read and I found  it very helpfull
Our neurologist said to orient my mom to reality, but the truth is this is often upsetting to her. So I just live with her inside her delusion world, unless the delusion world clashes with reality in a safety way or she becomes paranoid or anxious, then I re-orient her.
Besides the book recommendations, watching some YouTube videos by Teepa Snow can be extremely helpful in preparing you for what's happening and what will happen.
I recommend the YouTube series “Molly’s Movement”.  A son documented his mother’s daily struggles with dementia.  He recorded every visit with her and then posted.  It is very interesting as it is from the patient and her family’s POV instead of a doctor’s.
I believe in being honest as much as possible, but I say whatever can be said to keep my dad happy and healthy, even if it means lying like an old rug. They are not experiencing the same reality and cannot use logic like we can, I see no benefit in trying to convince them otherwise.
If my mom says flat out wrong things, as long as it’s not hurting her or anyone else, I just let it go. If we’re talking to someone who needs to know the truth about the situation she’s referring to (doctor about a specific event, other support persons) I may sidebar with them or gently remind her of what reality actually was. Other than that I let her just dream on because as long as she’s happy, that’s all that matters.
As others have said, if they aren't hurting anyone ots best to just go with ot as much as possible. I watched a woman give a Bible study to a bunch of imaginary people and let her do her thing because she was happy. When she was confused why they didn't stay for dinner I just told her they had plans and would stay next time.

I've told a woman there was snow coming in October because she was waiting for friends to pick her up for dinner even though there were no such plans. I said they had postponed due to possible snow and it redirected her.

But if they are going to hurt themselves, find a way to redirect or stop them. I sat with a gentleman for over an hour once because he insisted his wheel chair was a walking chair not a sitting chair and refused to use it properly. It wouldn't have been a huge deal except he was a bad fall risk and I wasn't in thy mood to let him fall and deal with the repercussions.",2022-05-06 14:56:07,Nonniemiss,ujuid9
Dementia,Help for a Newbie,"My mother is 77. She lives alone in a small town with no public transportation and everything she needs being at least a 15 to 20 minute drive away. She still has her license and drives daily. My sisters and I each live anywhere from a 2 to 12 hour drive from her house. She has a very supportive friend network at home. This is how we found out she was having problems. My sisters started getting phone calls from her friends a little over a year ago voicing some concerns. She was repeating herself in conversations. She would show up for a meeting on the wrong day. Stuff like that. After being alerted by her friends we started to pick up on some of the same issues in our phone conversations with her. My sisters and I all go to mom's for a week or so every summer as a kind of reunion. This last summer we voiced our concerns with the memory issues she was having and suggested that she permit us access to some things and that she schedule an appointment with her Dr. to see what might be the source of the problem. She acknowledged that she was ""a little forgetful"" and wasn't combative or argumentative, but it did seem like she lacked the insight into the potential severity of her situation. We scheduled an appointment with her Primary Care Physician that one of my sisters was able to attend with my mother.  

After a mini test and a referral to a neurologist for an MRI the results came back showing a pretty normal brain for someone her age and a diagnoses of mild dementia.

In the immediate aftermath we made sure we had access to her bank accounts so we can monitor activity. She has given her PCP permission to speak with us about her care and we can all look up her medical information on the online portal for her Drs. office. We also have the ability to track her by her iphone when she remembers to keep it with her.  I brought her to stay with me for a month over the winter with the plan of having her evaluate if she wanted to come and stay with me permanently. My sisters have done the same. Over the course of the past 6 to 8 months it is apparent to us that mom has some serious deficits. She still has trouble focusing on dates and times. She takes blood pressure and diabetes medication that we can't get her to stick with consistently. We have tried the pill containers with the days of the week and all of that stuff, she just doesn't remember that she needs to take them. She still drives and is familiar enough with everything at home that she knows where things are and how to get to her house, but in the last few days a friend of hers, who is a saint and spends a lot of time with her, informed us that she was out with mom for lunch and when they left the restaurant mom couldn't remember where she parked her car and had trouble remembering how to get to her friends house to drop her off.

She is flying out to stay with me this Sunday. The original plan was to have her here for a week or two, but I'm starting to question if I can let her go home, and just typing that has made me start crying. I'm already feeling overwhelmed and I feel like things aren't going to get any easier.

I have drafted a financial and medical power of attorney and plan to take her into my office on Monday, where we have several notaries, to get them executed. 

I'm scheduling an appointment with a local Geriatrician with the hopes of getting a more detailed assessment of her cognitive deficits. 

I have also reached out to my local County office of Adult and Aging Services to see what resources they might have. 

I plan to discuss with her, as I have previously, what her thoughts are. I have told her from the beginning that I want her to be as much a part of this process as possible as opposed to feeling like it's something that is happening to her, but her insight into the gravity of her illness is poor and I don't have any faith that she has a reliable memory of any of the detailed conversations we have had around the issue. When we do discuss it she is open and her responses remain fairly consistent. 

I am also thinking about seeing if I can set up tours of some local long term residential memory care facilities so she can get a look at them now while she's at a point where she can still give me feedback about what she does and does not like so down the road I'm not flying blind. There is a part of me that feels like all of this might be too much for her too, so I don't know. 

I'm going to wait to see what the Geriatrician has to say, but I think I'm looking at two options. One is letting her return home where she is familiar with things and has a solid support system of friends, and hiring someone to come in for a few hours in the mornings every day to make sure she knows what she has on the agenda for the day and that she's taking her meds. The other is having her stay here permanently. 

My sister was at my mother's earlier this week to pick mom up. She said the house is in good shape and well kept. Mom pays her bills, is active with her friend group, and is capable of all her normal Activities of Daily living and caring for herself for the most part, but she's just very forgetful and gets disoriented. 

I'm just afraid that I'm going to let her go back and something bad is going to happen. 

So now that I've written way too much I guess I'm wondering if I'm doing everything I should. Is there more I should do with her when she's here? Am I trying to do too much and will it confuse her? If she is going to stay here permanently, is it terrible of me to just make that decision and keep her here without any kind of lead up or preparation for her to leave where she has been for the past 50 years? Would allowing her to return home for a short period of time to get things organized at her house confuse her even more than just having her stay here and having me go back to get necessary things on my own without her? 

For everyone who has been doing this for a while what are the things I'm not doing at these early stages that I should be, and what sort of things can I do to help her function as independently as possible for as long as possible considering she's on the very front end of this thing?","You have done all the right things. First thing tho, is take the car keys away. She is becoming a
Danger to herself and others on the road. A part time care giver would also be key here.. to help her go out and about, grocery shop, etc. Ensuring her bills should also be a priority. Not knowing how you plan to pay for a long term care facility, maybe invest in some cameras where you can “pop in” on her. I did this with my mom and she was half a world away, and was able to monitor her comings and goings. Eventually I figured out she was just not in a good place and finally brought her home with us. Good luck.
The thing about dementia is all can be good one day then take a turn for the worse the very next day.  People with dementia get easily confused and when confused cannot make the right decisions as they have lost the ability to reason things out.  She should not be driving, that's a hard one, but she could get hurt or hurt someone.  My husband is not allowed near the stove cause he places things on the burner then turns the burner on and walks away.......he fried a crock pot and electric kettle doing that. He puts milk in the cupboards, he loses just about everything he touches, but if you were to come visit you would think he was OK. Go see an Elder Attorney and get some information on what they would recommend as far as legal documents you will need. Consider keeping her with you and not letting her come back home.  You think she can actively make good decisions about where to live but I doubt she can really process what she is being told. I guess maybe the choice is do the move when things are ""good"" as opposed to having to do more of an emergency move because of a downturn in her condition. Good luck.
I'm impressed!  You've got this all thought out, all planned out, and you and your siblings are discussing options, communicating, and communicating with your mother.  This sounds like a good beginning to a responsible plan of action which is (hopefully) acceptable to all, including your mother.
I think it can be a good idea to keep her in her current town as long as possible. Socialization is extremely important, as well as her going out for interesting activities and stimulating her mind. If there is any type of downtown core, like a historic old town that’s more walkable, that would be ideal for her to move into. She needs to stop driving yesterday. Dementia patients are fine until suddenly they are not. And you don’t get any warning. 

Believe it or not, maintaining good manners in public, practicing empathy, and holding conversation are all muscles that have to be exercised to keep those abilities, and once people with dementia stop doing that frequently, they lose those skills. 

Do start taking tours of facilities. You may want to consider assisted living in her town. She should move to some assisted living before her cognitive skills decline because she still has the ability to learn new muscle memory in her new dwelling and navigate a simple campus.

If she lives in your home detached from all her friends, she won’t enjoy that rich social life, and you may resent each other over time because she has to rely on you for everything. 

you may also consider setting up mail forwarding or at least USPS Informed delivery so you can be aware of important matters that arrive by mail. 

You are clearly doing your research and you’re really on top of the legal, medical, and logistical concerns. you’re doing a great job.
I don't know that I'd move her just yet, but discuss the options with her for the near future. She definitely needs someone checking to see if she's taking her meds. My mom messed up her meds and landed herself in the hospital with congestive heart failure because she got angry when we realized she'd messed them up and refused to take them when my sister set her meds box up for the week and took the bottles home with her to keep her from messing them up again. Things went from ""Mom's in the early stages of dementia,"" to her being in restraints in the hospital just a few months later because she started slapping anyone who came near her, including the chaplain, nurses and security. Severe sundowning, paranoia, just wham. She lost a lot of ground in that hospitalization and if we'd realized beforehand, it could've been prevented. I took over doing her meds box and delivered it to my brother who lived with her every week, she couldn't be trusted with her pills and he'd give her each dose personally or she'd take the entire day's pills at once.
Does she have a friend who would be willing/able to live with her for the next year? Ideally she would remain in her own home and live with someone she likes who can drive and provide companionship. Not as an employee but someone who might benefit from having a free place to live and be in need of companionship themselves.",2022-05-06 14:36:43,jbhmrofo,uju3ki

My mother somehow managed to loose 3k on a plane flight from her home country to here when we decided to move her back. It was furious.
I had a housekeeper who once stowed $1000 in local currency UNDER the drip pan in the gas oven the DAY BEFORE Thanksgiving.  I pre-heated the over to cook, and guess what went up in smoke.  I couldn't see the bills to see what was happening, and she was really sluggish at figuring it out (and had forgotten all about it, but zombie-like walked to the oven, slowly, with hotpads, opened it, and took out the drip pan.

PS I live in a third world country where housekeepers are cheap and necessary, to explain the housekeeper angle.
Wait until he goes to sleep and steal it back perhaps? If he is anything like my Grandma, check under his pillow Or in the tissue box. Oddly, this is where she stashed her dentures.

The thing about prescriptions are that they can change from dosage to being discontinued so keep the list current.  Let your cousins know of the notebook and where it is kept in case they ever need the information.
It does sound overwhelming. Did it for my parents. Doing it now for my life partner.

Start small. When you make a doctor's appointment, pick up a medication refill, access an online portal, take a moment to write down relevant details. Have one dedicated repository. 

Perhaps buy a ""pretty,"" semi-expensive dedicated notebook which stays near your computer. (My favorite ""treat"" notebook vendor is JetPens.com.) Looseleaf, so you can reshuffle or add info as needed. Indexed sections for specific kinds of info. Don't worry about a complete list to start—getting it started is the largest hurdle. 

I also keep with me a ""commonplace book"" (online searchable term) for on-the-fly notes, info that I gather when I'm not near the repository to make an immediate note. Decide on a system for signalling to yourself important info that must be transferred to the repository, or has been transferred—strike-outs, a checkbox, whatever. Avoid tearing pages out, as you may need them to reconstruct info & dates later. 

Tell the backup crew that it exists, where to find it. That way they aren't tasked with storing and assembling updated postings as you make them. 

The panic about ""Dorothy's house"" is real. Mine is ""Chinese space junk."" A few years ago, the Chinese space program launched something where various boosters & junk were going to fall back to earth ""who knows where."" They fell into the ocean; could have hit Manhattan; statistically unlikely, but possible.

Edit:I'm not bashing China. I'm sure the US has created equal or worse issues. ""Don't Look Up.""
Hugs. It is overwhelming. Re the Wifi & Netflix passwords, tbh, if you're worried, write them down & stick them on the back of the router & telly box. 

Re the medications, as others have said, jot down in a notebook, send them along with any other relevant info in an email to your cousins, consider even having a Whatsapp group on your auntie's behalf, just to keep all family members updated. 

In the very unlikely event that Dorothy's house does drop on you, and your cousins are scrambling, they should be able to contact your auntie's medical advisor, who should hopefully have the medication info on record, ditto they can have the passwords etc reset. 

Take care x
My sister and I keep track of everything in Google Workspace (only an option if you can keep a secure password though). We have a spreadsheet with all our mom's bills and due dates, payment methods, ID info, account credentials, dates of medical or other events with descriptions and action items, contact info for everyone involved in her care, etc all on separate tabs. Hopefully my sister and I wouldn't both drop dead at the same time, but in case that happens, my husband would have access to all of this. Edit: I should say this is accessible from a phone (you can even have offline access).
If you want to DM me, I'll type it all down for you and send it to you electronically. I'll give you my credentials upon direct contact.",2022-05-06 08:58:30,Potter299,ujmw58
Dementia,How long after a stroke do noticeable symptoms of vascular dementia appear?,"My father had a stroke 2 years ago. He was 57 back then (turning 60 this year) and has type 2 diabetes, used to smoke (but stopped long time before the stroke) and drink (not too much), he also never was a sporty person, he couldn't walk long distances. I'm just wondering, I'm really afraid he could have it. Thank you!","what are his symptoms?
Noticeable symptoms would be apparent the next day but should improve to a degree over the next few months then stabilize.

A stroke would not cause changes 2 years later. New infarcts could cause further decline, however.

Dementia,Experiences with Care.com/hiring caregivers?,"Hi, it's finally time that I need more help with my mom, but looking for caregivers is feeling so daunting, sad, and stressful. It's hard to leave my mom in someone else's hands because it feels like there are a million ways it could go wrong. Does anyone have any advice on what to ask caregivers when I interview them?","It’s a very stressful situation, but ultimately getting her the help she needs will give you both some peace.
With any potential caretaker, there are a few immediate things to look for: do they have a valid driver’s license, are they a certified home health aide/RN/LPN, how long have they been doing the work, do they have their own insurance, and do they have any references you might be able to speak with?
We recently got a live-in aide for my mom, and it’s been a really good transition so far. We have a referral agency in our area which came highly recommended by several friends and also the memory care clinic my mom had been seeing for her checkups. 
It’s daunting, and there’s a lot of anxiety in leaving them with someone. But when you find a good fit, know that this is that person’s job- they are trained to deal with everything you might not be able to handle due to your own emotional attachments.
Best of luck, and know that there is help.",2022-05-06 03:35:19,skyskiesku,uji47d

Dementia,Am I the only FT caretaker that feels like I may be Manic Depressive?,"Genuine question.. 

Before you became a FT dementia caretaker, were you happy?

I remember being happy.

Some days are ok and I get excited about that but apparently the sudden expression of the ok seems off to my husband because I am usually miserable..

I was just looking up depression/bipolar disorder symptoms and I REALLY don’t think that is the issue.. — We are completely on our own with him and obviously we love him but I leave the house every other Sunday and we have to bring him and his wheelchair so he can bitch the whole time..

Things weren’t perfect before this cluster-fuck but I was able to wake up in the morning without dreading everything in the house…

I am assuming if I saw a psych I would be told that it’s just stress but it’s scary because some days are good and ‘normal’.. Other days I only get out of the bedroom to attend to his needs and the resentment that I feel boils my blood.. (I know it’s not Pops’ fault, it’s the other relatives that abandoned us without help)

Idk, sorry for ranting.. 


Hugs to everyone on this subreddit! 💕","I feel you.  Soon after my husband was diagnosed I was really, really angry. I thought back to all the crap he did that was unhealthy and blamed him for what was happening and how he destroyed all of our future plans.  How all of our plans were now in the toilet. How his illness means now that I don't have any future other than taking care of him.  I was just pissed, then the sadness overcame me.  Every morning I wold cry in the shower and times during the day I would start crying and then in the middle of the night I would cry.  I was pretty much an emotional wreck but trying very hard to not let anyone know I was a mess.  I am now at the point of acceptance.  I do still get angry and sad but not at all at the earlier level.  I was offered medication for depression but didn't want to go that direction. I am working my way through this and take one day at a time and on some days one minute at a time.  I don't like to think that towards the end of my life I will be caring for him instead of soaking in as much enjoyment that is left for me.  Just do you best to hold on and know that this is an emotional roller coaster and there are times when you will lose your grip but that you also regain that grip.  Peace and love.
You need to talk to your local department of aging about resources to get some help for your dad.  Can you have a homemaker come in part-time? Could he go to adult day care? Maybe he should move to an assisted living center.  It's overwhelming to care for someone alone.  You've got to get some help.
You hit upon a key word I've been dealing with myself; dread. It just sucks the life out of everything",2022-05-06 01:48:40,FrogPosse84,ujgmu4
Dementia,My dad was just placed in a nursing home today,"My dad was placed in a nursing home today. He was diagnosed with early stages of Alzheimer's with dementia. He keeps asking the same questions over and over and over. I feel devastated. There is no money for the quality of care I would like to give him: nurses at home, 24 hours. I am brokenhearted.","I'm not sure how much comfort this will bring you but I feel I should say this given my many years spent working with those  with advanced dementia. I feel that I can say with confidence that there have only been a select few cases where  24/hr care within a home setting may have worked out for that individual long term. The majority of the time the disease process progresses to the point where the environment itself is no longer appropriate and they require more care and supervision than one round the clock health care worker can safely provide. Take a deep breath and do all you can to try to alleviate the feelings of guilt. It's best to focus instead on all the many other beneficial ways that you can be of support to him (ie: socially and emotionally) now that he's been admitted.
It sucks. It will keep sucking. But he needs the care. Visit when you can. Bring pictures, letters from family, and stick around a bit to tell stories about them. 

My dad can't read anymore, but his friends still send letters and I read them to him. He'll ramble a bit about the people or events he remembers, I'll take notes and send back what I can in a thank-you note to the people who sent him stuff. It's rough.
It hurts but you'll find that you can be his child again, loving on him, spending quality time with him rather than worrying about meds and toilets and when he ate last, etc. Just be sure you or someone close sees him regularly to keep an eye on the quality of the staff until you're comfortable with them.
I don't think there are many people who could afford to pay for 24 hour in home care. I don't think it would even be possible for a caregiver to give the kind of care which will be needed in a home setting.  As much as it hurts this placement is probably the best thing for him.  Now your part is going to visit hm on a regular basis and making sure he has whatever he may need and listening to him even as he keeps repeating himself.  Just love on him as much as you can and come to know this is best for him.
I am so sorry.   This disease is worse for those of us watching it most times as the patient is hopefully happy, albeit in another time and place in their mind.  It is one of the saddest things I have ever witnessed with my grandmother.     My grandfather, before he passed, was in the beginning stages of dementia and I remember my heart shattering when he referred to me as “that blond girl”, I was devastated—but when he was passing on hospice he kept calling my name.  He never truly forgot me.   Now knowing my grandmother is basically living in 1958 in her mind crushes my soul, but she is content to blather on about the baby she gave birth to the night before, although there were dark moments too.  
You are doing the right thing.  I am so, so sorry you were dealt this hand.
I know what you are going through. We had to put my dad in a few months ago. It’s hard but my mom was wearing herself down caring for him and we can not afford home care. He has triggers also and will have temper outbursts.  Being changed and bathed are both triggers.  The staff have been great with him. In fact i have only recognized how great they are after his hospital stay.  Not everyone can work with dementia patients. The staff at his nursing home know how to handle him and it helps they give him meds to calm him down. I hate him being medicated but honestly it’s necessary. Hes like wrestling a bear when he doesn’t want to cooperate. And will punch people. I was so worried about my mom caring for him because she was lighting herself on fire to keep him warm. Now she can visit him all the time and someone else can do the heavy lifting so to speak.  Ppl are judgmental about nursing homes, but most families don’t have the luxury to choose alternatives.",2022-05-05 21:15:05,sandstar44,ujc1ti
Dementia,How do I find a good sitter?,"I am my mom's sole caregiver, and she can no longer be left alone. I won't have anyone else to spell me until some time in July. (No family nearby. No friends I could ask.) Meanwhile, I just found out that my doctor has moved away, and I can't renew my prescriptions without being seen by a new doctor. Can anyone give me advice for finding someone to look after my mom for an hour or two while I'm at the doctor? Where do I look? How do I vette them? What qualifications should I look for? What can I reasonably expect from a short-term carer? What are the going rates?

If I can figure this out, I may look into having someone come in for a couple of hours a week going forward, and I'm wondering if they might be able to, for instance, take her on short day trips to the movies, or on walks, for example, so I can have some much-needed time to myself. Or can I get someone to come help her shower, do her nails, and other personal grooming duties?","I used Care.com. I was really fortunate in that the first person I interviewed was amazing. She was just off a 6 month job and that client was moved closer to family.
I thought I could manage just with Susan, but we realized we needed a second person. Susan knew a lady that she often worked with who is a retired nurse. So I hired her too. As they were friends, I let them figure out the schedule so it worked for the 2 of them.
They literally saved my life. I couldn’t have managed without them.
My dad has passed away but I still keep in touch with both of them and one or the other will dog/housesit for us at times. 
I got several references for both of them.
I highly recommend an agency such as Visiting Angels or Right at Home. They do all the hard work for you and vet all of their caregivers. When I hired through Visiting Angels, their nurse came by for an assessment, and a few days later I met grandma's caregiver along with the supervising coordinator.

I believe they are very flexible about drop-in visits as well.
I also recommend using a care agency because they take care of a lot of the details and often have people to fill in if your primary helper isn't available. They usually work in 4-hour minimum shifts, but I think that's a good thing. We found that while my MIL is still resistant to letting us help her shower and wipe up, she lets the caregiver do it. Huge huge help.
I’m in US and looked online for “home care dementia” in my local area. I found a few and started calling. The first said they must have at least 10 hours minimum. The second was Comfort Keepers and they prefer at least 4 hours but can modify, 24/7 on call, hourly rate is same for days, nights and weekends. They do a home visit to set up a schedule/new client. I have a home visit next Thursday. Their rate for me was $26.95 an hour.

In Germany and Switzerland (the two countries I‘ve lived in) our care homes have a kind of day-care for the elderly. With some of the places, they can stay for a week or more so you can take a holiday. Maybe the care homes in your country offer something similar?

Edit: this goes for dementia patients as well

Dementia,Should I be concerned?,"My mums father died many many years ago from dementia and in the past two years or so my mum has become a bit more forgetful? She struggles to get her words out and it just makes me worry because of her dad. She was on anti depressants for a short while but we thought it was best for her to come off them because her forgetfulness was getting more noticeable, but now she’s been off them for a while she seems to be the same? 

(She also had covid last year and I’ve heard a side effects from that can be forgetfulness and memory issues) 

Is there anything I can do to help her and should I be worried?","Depending on her age, could be menopause. 

In my experience, the inability to reason through major decisions like handling finances, frequently getting scammed, not sympathizing with others, mood swings and getting mean or angry… that these happen some years before the obvious cognitive symptoms
I thought my mom coming off of trazedone (lifelong insomniac) was causing her brain fog and forgetfulness but it was early-onset dementia. My suggestion is to get her in for a neuro test ASAP because unfortunately, most of the time it takes to them a year to fully assess any cognitive decline (by taking the same test a year later).",2022-05-05 13:09:15,Donutcomeforme,uj243v
Dementia,What are the top 3 things you are struggling with as a caregiver?,"What are the top 3 things you are struggling with as a caregiver? 

Being an engineer and seeing the toll caregiving takes on family members, I wonder what can be done to make caregiver’s life a bit easier.","Top 3 struggles:  

1. Deteriorating relationships amongst non-dementia family members due to the stress of caregiving. We all contribute in different ways (and amounts/times), and this leads to petty resentments and conflict.  

2. Knowing that the end is coming, but having no idea if it's coming in days, months, or years. Will she die tonight? Will she just keep declining for decades? Will I ever get my own life back?  

3. Sure there are lots of resources and help available, but navigating phone trees and bureaucracy to access them is a challenge even when one is not tired and depressed.
How about a system where we would not have to bankrupt ourselves to care for our loved ones.  Or a system where we don't have to pay thousands and thousands of dollars a month to place them in a good facility.  Or a system that would pay the family members, who give up everything, to care for them at home.
The whole ordeal of being a caregiver is a struggle. To narrow it down then my top 3 would be these.

1.watching my loved one lose less of who he used to be and suffer indignities such as being incontinent which brings me to my 2nd struggle.

2.Cleaning my loved one who has become so combative at times that its hard to keep my composure and temper down. He's prone to UTIs so getting him clean is necessary and keeping him hydrated.

3.Expenses of caregiving that not only include financial needs but also its mentally taxing. Money wise its very costly to meet our loved ones extra needs such as diapers,clothes,medications and adding things to their diet like Ensure drinks aren't cheap. The time we lose as caregivers is costly because of not being able to work or put our lives on hold for those who had plans of a career or family. 

When it comes to time we caregivers sacrifice personal time to the point where it would be a miracle to get 5 minutes alone in the bathroom if possible. Its even more of struggle when none of the other family members step up to give you a break and when you do ask for help you're met with lies or excuses. Overall you'll struggle til your loved one passes or your sanity breaks.
1. My husband still has access to his phone and computer. This is an issue as he clicks on phishing links, is constantly changing passwords on accounts, and/or believes anything someone tells him on the phone, or who comes to the door.

2. Isolation! There is a Significant lack of supportive friends & family members who can’t accept he is declining so they come around less and /or no longer call.

3. Absorbing all the household responsibilities that used to be done by two people.  I have resorted to hiring out what services I can (home repairs, lawn/snow care), but everything from paying bills online, car repairs, scheduling & driving to all appointments, and keeping track of multiple calendars are all very challenging for a senior.
1. Guilt - guilty for how I feel towards them, guilty that I want some time off from being a caregiver, guilty I need to keep her at arms length to protect myself.
2. Asking for help. 
3. The unknown. When will it be bad enough for sitters? Full time care? Assisted living? Memory care?  I struggle with not having a timeline to follow.
1. Losing so much of our own lives to her care. We are in our 40s and dealing with our own health issues but the vast majority of our time and energy is spent caring for her because she needs us 24/7. We pay exorbitant money for weekend help but it’s only 3 days and the whole time we’re getting constant phone calls about her having issues. It feels like we are losing years of our own lives, with plans put on hold, no vacations, no time with friends and no concept of how long this might last. It is taking a massive toll on my partner in particular who quit working to do this. 

2. She is unable to perform hygiene and losing continence which leads to nonstop UTIs which worsen her condition. It’s a vicious cycle. We are about to try bathing wipes and a bidet but unclear how much she will let us do willingly. 

3. Something I don’t see spoken of often: she and my partner did not have a good relationship prior to this but it’s an only child of an only child situation. It wasn’t to the point of abuse/partner shouldn’t be the caregiver, it was just very strained and difficult bc MIL is very emotionally immature and self centered. So there are complicated feelings. But a lot of caregiver support centers on loving the person you’re caring for, grieving their condition, etc. so my partner does not benefit from those services.
I’d like to add the guilt I feel all the time.
My dad is my mom’s primary caregiver. I never thought I’d be wiping my own mother’s butt or changing her diapers and smelling her pee. She’s washed every morning because often times when she sleeps (being incontinent) she’ll go while she sleeps and can wake up soaked in urine. This isn’t the life she envisioned. 

1. Isolation 
2. The stress of caregiving 
3. When is this going to end??
1. Is caring for my father hurting my marriage?

2. Will I be forced to give up my dream of being a mother because I must care for my father?

3. Will I end up like this?
My Mom fell into deep depression when my stepdad’s cancer became terminal. She virtually stopped eating and drank herself into Wernicke’s Syndrome (looks very much like dementia), but she always was a heavy drinker. Went to hospital almost comatose before Thanksgiving, then rehab. Stepdad died after Christmas but she never knew. She is mobile with a cane, mostly lucid but sometimes incontinent, very narcissistic, can’t remember what she did this morning and insists she needs to “go home” to her parents (both died in 90s) or walk home. I moved her from NY (rehab) to my home in SC in February this year. I’m retired and widowed. 

1.  I miss my life prior to caregiving. I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to. I resent that she gave no thought to what would happen, her care, living arrangements, etc!! Just gave up and it’s still all about her! She’s always right…insists her parents are alive, my stepdad was just here, everything is “her fault” and “everyone has left” her, she has no money (not true) and has nowhere to go!! 

2.  I’m paying all her and my stepdad’s bills, care, etc because he left everything to her and she has no POA!! So now I have to talk her into signing one when she’s lucid or wait till she’s lived here 6 months and file for guardianship (could be $6000). 

3.  I hate having a shadow all day every day! I can’t make a phone call or type on my laptop without her looking over my shoulder. I’m dreading to home visit with a home care agency next week because she will be here. 

I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder. This is making my head and body a mess!!
For me(28m) and my grandmother(71f)with dementia I struggle with hygiene care as my girlfriend has expressed she can't and won't do it. I have no way to ensure she bathes properly unless a home Healthcare worker does it. Also, I struggle with getting her to understand simple things such as not cleaning the bathroom with lotion. After my grandfather died and my mom forced me to take care of her (not that I mind cause ninny raised me) or how to use her roku TV with voice commands, or to not try on every article of clothing she has everyday, or to not hide her shoes.
I’m currently in a situation of an unknown future.

We’ve been caring for my mother-in-law with moderate dementia, and she fell and broke her hip a few days ago. 

She’s currently recovering from hip replacement surgery and we have no idea how/if she’s going to recover if her determination to get better doesn’t improve.

She lives in a two story house, so we’re going to have to make adjustments quickly. 

It’s a curveball we weren’t prepared for and we’re very stressed right now with the uncertain path going forward.
1. Medicare is bullshit. Understanding the difference between (dis)Advantage plans is nearly impossible to glean. I can't imagine how uneducated persons or those without access to the internet are supposed to do anything other than toss a coin or be enthralled by the latest washed up celeb endorsement.
2. Tax-funded facilities (Medcaid/Medicare) should have publicly-posted, a la carte pricing of baseline services. It should be that way with all care. I understand services will vary based on the needs of the individual, but I should be able to visit your website or call and get a baseline cost without having to make an in-person visit like I'm trying to buy a timeshare.
3. The guilt and resentment. I am taking care of two people I love as best I can (neither is a parent), but I am also well aware that she burned through her retirement, he never truly worked, both lived a life well beyond their means, and neither bothered to make even the most remedial of plans for themselves. I feel guilty when I take time for myself, that I can't take care of them at home, that I do not have endless funds to put them in better facilities with better care, etc.
Worked long hours running our own business, was looking forward to retirement, now I stay home all the time  Taking care of hubby. Top struggles

1. not knowing if I will have a future. How old will I be when this is said and done. How will my health be.
2. He uses a straight cath an lately had back to back uti and needed a foley.  Really stressful keeping an eye on him so he doesn’t pull it out. Yells at me and blames me. Why did I do this to him .  if he would just leave it alone he might heal .
3. he asks me questions that make no sense and expects an answer . my brain is so taxed at times I can’t think straight.

Also  ditto on all other comments
It ALWAYS gets worse. I’m learning to lower my expectations and just roll with her deteriorating condition and cry.
1 - the verbal abuse i deal with on a constant basis. no conversation is without rudeness, condescension, illogical demands and comments that spun more vitriol. the graphic and lengthy descriptions of BMs and soiled pants and wet beds and soaked PJs.

2 - the persistent lack of support i've dealt with from family and medical providers. The neurologist who is now retired should have never worked around people. The neuropsyche who failed to do a proper test and prolonged the danger he was to himself and those in his independent living community. the younger brother who sponged off his for over ten years until the TIA and i was able to put my foot down and get him out of an unsafe house and closer to me. that brother has made one visit for about 20 minutes on the way to a girlfriend's house and about one phone call every six months for the last four years.

3 - the bitterness. i'm tired of making daily phone calls for medical appts, insurance companies to do their damn jobs and on and on. i want to enjoy a little bit of the time i have left on this planet and i can't.
The anger. Mom won’t take a bath and she stinks and told me I was the worst daughter ever for washing her sheets and clothes. She says I treat her horribly even though I’ve moved heaven and earth to try and keep her at home
1 I love my grandma, but I've never particularly liked her. She's selfish, self-centred, self-absorbed, etc. It's Aall me, me, me. Dementia has made that so much worse

2 Other family members. My mum and I are over every day to look after my gran. Other family, who live 20 mind away, just pop in occasionally, take her out to lunch, and don't do anything useful, like washing dishes, or laundry.

3 The uncertainty. Are we going to go over tomorrow and find her dead in her bed? Will there be poop all over the carpet?
Pay, pay, pay. We don't make enough to live, it's rediculous.

Dementia,"Grandmother seemingly remembers everything when distant relatives stop in, but forgets who I am, or tells us she missed her period and is having a baby.","Why can she seem so unaffected by this disease when distant relatives/ friends visit her, but will forget who my mom or I am, and we’re the only ones who’ve ever been there for her day in and day out??

Your extended family members should come and visit for a few days if they don't believe the diagnosis. Believe me when I say when they're woken up at 2AM to your grandmother wandering into their room, it'll convince them of the severity of the situation.
Dementia is weird in that way. Sometimes they fixate on a time period. She could recognize her extended family from long ago because that’s the time period she’s remembering. You weren’t born yet. In her mind she may be 20 years old. She may be a child. 
I once care for a patient who couldn’t recognize her kids or grandkids but knew her sister and talked all the time about being in college. In her mind, she was 18. She constantly asked where her boyfriend was, who she hadn’t seen, talked to, or even heard of in more than 50 years. Dementia is unpredictable, and harsh. I’m so sorry this happening to you.
Short term memory goes first. Long term memory lasts longer. So relatives she’s known longer are in her long term memory.
My dads the same way.  I'm the youngest of 3.  Both older siblings live over  6 hours away  and never  call and visit maybe  once a year for a few hours.  His memory will be better then and they think I'm exaggerating.   
  My personal feeling is that because he see them only once a year that makes him happier then when he sees me ( I'm there at least 3 times a week) and that happiness helps the memory.
My husband of 40 years does this when talking to family on the phone that doesn’t spend time with him. Apparently I am the bad person because I told them I was struggling with caring for him 24/7. Their reaction was so visceral- we don’t talk anymore.

These family members were so convinced he was “ok”, and that I was exaggerating, that they bought him airline tickets to fly to visit them (and extended family on his side) over the holidays last fall. I wasn’t consulted or invited.

My poor husband was so confused, he quickly lost his drivers license at the airport. The frantic actions needed to get him home without his ID was justly deserved by them.

Sadly, after spending a number of days alone with him they no longer call to check on him. They just can’t accept he is not well, so they choose to look away.
They're hiding their weaknesses, like my grandmother will make small talk with anyone or agree with what they say, and she never asks about what day it is or anything else she's anxious about, but then after they're gone she'll ask me ""who were they?"" - she wants to seem normal.  With you she relaxes and can let her weakness show, even if she can't bring your names to mind she knows you're someone to be trusted.
This happened with my grandmother.  My mother had everyone convinced she was faking since she only acted that way when only my mom was there  & doing this stuff for attention, well it wasn’t.  I would visit and she would be fine with me.  It’s sad she was denied early intervention so long.   Not that it could’ve changed anything but perhaps my mother’s attitude.
Yep!

Our caseworker explained it as ego and pride are the last to go. My grandmother, while beyond her means to act normal, will be able to form full sentences, try to answer questions or just try to be as present as she can if someone she doesn’t know is in the house.
When my mom is having a bad time remembering or repeating the same thing over and over I discreetly record her with my phone. I can usually tell when she is in a mood. I then have the recording to show her doctor instead of trying to explain. You could try this method but send it to your relatives so they can actually see what's going on. Good luck to you, denial is very powerful.
Have them visit or you visit them for a few days, then you both go out for hours so they're her primary carer for a day.",2022-05-04 21:34:52,nmadonna,uim34d
Dementia,Exhausted but somewhat satisfied,"For the first time in 2 years we had taken an evening off. We were going into town to see a concert. Generally days pass with no issue but the one time we stray away where we aren't the closest people on call guess what happens?
I (not her child, I'm her daughter in law) get the call that 'there is no power and I don't know what to do'. FFS. Now what? Call the other children, can you check on your mother please? Call the care team, have you been in yet? Can you sort it out?
Long, long, long story short, a bulb blew. One light bulb. I'm so damn tired of this but at the same time I'm also gratified that she still trusts me enough to be her first port of call in a storm. It's just such hard damn work and I'm really tired.",Went through a similar time with my mom. Before she was diagnosed we would go to concerts and such and let her know we'd be gone (she is in a mom in law apt at our house). Sure enough I'd get the calls. One time we got home and she was gone. After almost having a panic attack we got a call from the hospital that she had called 911 because she wasn't well but they couldn't find anything wrong and could we pick her up. This became her way of keeping us there. We would be watching TV or something and an ambulance would pull up. Now she is much further along in dementia and doesn't do it anymore. We go out but don't tell her anything and our son stays in case something actually comes up. We were gone for a week for our anniversary and she has no idea. Time means nothing to her so I don't mention anything.,2022-05-04 20:39:54,Maleficent_Swordfish,uil0mh
Dementia,My dad is getting to the point where he doesn’t recognize my mom at night… how far into his dementia do you think he is? He’s only 54,,"It's pretty common with Lewy Body to not recognize people fairly early on in the disease. A lady I knew used to be sometimes 5 or 6 people a day to her husband, depending on what his hallucinations at the time were. He'd treat her like a business partner, an old girlfriend who needed to leave because he was married now, etc. She just went with it and he'd eventually come back to recognizing her for a bit. It's an awful disease.
It's hard to say. My Father didn't recognise my mother about 2 months ago and only this past week he doesn't recognise me (son) anymore. 

Everyones decline is going to be at a different rate depending on their type and a lot of other issues. My father is declining a lot faster than most because he simply isn't eating and his body is wasting away. We can't force him to eat. He is so light and frail now and it's heartbreaking. 

All the best to you.
What type of dementia does he have? I’d say that’s getting into the moderate stage. Sadly, I know of several people who have dementia at that age.
I must’ve been really out of it - I have brain fog - he’s 64 not 54",2022-05-04 20:13:27,Tasty-Whole-8784,uiki04
Dementia,FDA Permits Marketing for New Test to Improve Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease,,,2022-05-04 19:06:20,HotMomentumStocks,uij5j6
Dementia,What Should I Ask The Neuropsychologist During Mom's Diagnosis Call?,"Several months ago, my mother suddenly began showing severe short-term memory issues. She had a brain MRI and it showed signs of chronic microvascular ischemia. Her father had Alzheimer's. We had her assessed by a neuropsychologist and the phone call that follows testing/report is coming up in a few days. Given the severity of her short-term memory loss, I am fully expecting a dementia diagnosis and the doctor will hopefully let us know how far along with that she is.

At present, she drives, food shops, can dress and bathe, etc. It's not clear whether she will be able to continue working, however, due to her memory issues. 

I am putting together a list of questions to ask the doctor during the call. I do not want to be overcome with emotion and unable to think on my feet so I want to be prepared. What questions should be on my list? Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart, for your time and help.","Just went through this recently. I’m so sorry you’re going through this! I’d ask if there is a need for a driving eval. Usually an OT will conduct if the doc requests. How to best support you mom (celebrating her abilities, not focusing on her disability). Types of medication they suggest and how they work. Suggestions for support groups for caregivers locally. How to best support her through the diagnosis process. Other things to look out for that your mom may miss (UTI is a common thing that can be missed by someone with dementia and cause a lot of temporary problems, warning signs, etc.). What to expect in the upcoming months regarding tests, appointments, etc.
Personally, I would not have a list of questions.  This is all brand new and can be overwhelming.  She will have regular follows up with the doctor, I assume you would go with her and you can ask questions as new things start happening.  I would not bring up the driving issue as it might upset your Mother.  This is something you need to monitor closely and make the decision to take the keys or disable the car when the time comes. Don't count on getting a ""stage"", likely no one will give that to you right now.  This is a process, a very long process.  She is maintaining right now so just be there to support her, note any changes which you can report on in following appointments.  Good luck, so sorry this is happening to your Mom and family.
Sudden memory loss is not really consistent with dementia.  Stress/anxiety and acute illness are more commonly associated with that.  Her intact instrumental ADLs are also not typical in dementia.

Regarding the MRI, everyone has chronic microvascular ischemia later in life so it greatly depends on the severity. 

The neuropsychologist will administer hours of objective tests so no need to worry too much about what to ask her.  

It's important to note that the neuropsychologist should not technically diagnose and this should be done by the neurologist using the neuropsych results as a part of the memory work up.

Hopefully, her issues are fixable and I wish her the best!
If you feels she is at the beginning of dementia has she had tests done? Is she still deemed competent to ensure her Will and personal directive and power of attorney up to date. This is important before she is considered incompetent. If she is given a Dementia diagnosis she will have to stop driving. A vehicle is very much a weapon. I would be asking the Dr on their opinion, I am sure he/she has been asked many times in their profession.
Where do they rate her on the Fast scale?

What type of dementia do they think she has?

What support/resources are available now?

What support/resources should you get lined up for the near future, and the far future?

is she still competent to make financial and other decisions on her own?

Should she be put on any of the meds intended to delay progress of the disease or ease symptoms?  
Her GP is Dr X, will they send a  copy of the testing and diagnosis and recommendations to that person? 

Are there any concerns about other meds or conditions she has that could make things worse?
That's great. What kind of work does she still do? If she is still safe and not make too many mistakes then probably good for her to continue. Will she qualify for disability if she can no longer work? Also is she on any meds? The Dr should recommend medication that may help. It's so good you are being proactive as too many people wait until the late stages.",2022-05-04 18:38:52,slowready,uiiket
Dementia,Does the Guilt Ever Go Away?,"Appreciative of this sub. Was kinda here on an old account years ago and wrote some posts. 

Anyway, my grandmother passed in 2019. 3 years ago this month. She had vascular dementia (specific type wasn't ever diagnosed but her symptoms and likely cause of dementia were all aligned with vascular dementia). She never forgot who we were. She loved when we were all in the house. She would call us some days every 30 mins for no reason. Some days she was paranoid. I felt so closed in some days but I'd go back to those days in a snap if I could have her back. 

Anyway, I still feel so much guilt at yelling at her, being short with her, etc. I helped my mom care for her then my sister returned to help. She was super easy to care for compared to most but getting her to listen many times was so hard and I know it was the dementia but also she was a stubborn thing and I felt part of that came through too. I feel so bad for yelling though. I wasn't angry. Just frustrated. I feel bad for not giving her the attention she needed some days. Especially after my mom got cancer. My sister and I were so worried because of the cancer treatments. We fed and changed my grandma and our caretaker was super helpful during that time. I want to apologize to her. Let her know I love her (I think she knew). But I just feel so guilty and feel like some of the diverted attention caused her eventual downturn. 

I miss that woman fiercely and watching her siblings pass away is making my grief come back harder. I wouldn't wish this disease on anyone.","The guilt may not go away but you know she forgives you. She likely didn’t remember you losing your temper.  We’ve all been there.  Especially before and at the beginning of diagnosis.  Before diagnosis, my sibs and I had no clue what was going on other than our mom was acting strange and lashing out at us when we reminded her that she “told us that already” or questioned her decisions.  It took me almost a year to kind of reach a zen attitude with mom and not lose my temper when she frustrated me.  Took one of my sibs even longer.  You did the best you could with what you were dealing with and that’s all we can do as caregivers.  You didn’t cause a downturn, the disease did.
""But I just feel so guilty and feel like some of the diverted attention caused her eventual downturn.""

I want to try to lay some of this guilt to rest right now. There is only one certainty with dementia and that is the patient will get worse and eventually die. And we as caregivers end up feeling like total failures because we expend absurd amounts of energy giving them the best life we reasonably can and trying to keep them alive, both tasks we are 100% doomed to eventually fail at. 

I didn't fully come to terms with my own guilt until playing a video game called Lost Words 6 months after mom's death. The protagonist is a little girl who is writing a story when her grandmother has a stroke. After her grandma passes she laments that if only she had finished the story sooner and read it to her grandmother maybe she would have survived. This is of course absurd and yet every single one of us does this after a loss. It's a way of trying to give past us agency in a situation that was 100% beyond our control. It's a normal part of the process but it's not an emotion we need to hold on to or beat ourselves up with. You are as faultless as the girl in Lost Words, try to remember that.

And last but not least you seem like a very loving young person, I can only imagine how proud you grandma would be of you. Big giant hugs to you.
I am sorry for your experiences. Guilt is normal. However, to me, it's like a rocking chair. It keeps you busy but doesn't get you anywhere. Forgive yourself. We all do what we can with what we know and the resources we have.
Think we make peace with what has happen, my dad had dementia. While he was still all there he would tell me we start out as a infant and go back to being a baby. When visiting him he would say I'm waiting for the senior to come for me meaning he was waiting for God to come for him.

He cared for me as a baby by bathing and changing my diaper. Towards the end I did the same for him and choose to see his passing as a celebration of his life for all that he did for us.

My wife parents both had colon cancer, they were good mentally and there body was failing. My mom is still here but is getting like my dad.

We both now know that our fate will likely be what our parents was.

You did the best you could with the stituation, so now live the best life you can.
You did the best you could, with the knowledge, energy, resources, and constraints that you had on you at the time. 

Dementia is a neuroDEGENERATIVE condition. This means that everyone can do everything 100% correctly the whole time, and the brain WILL still deteriorate in spite of all your efforts.

Dementia,Dementia - is it present for years before diagnosis?,"I am in the early days of suspecting my mom might have dementia.  I think there's something not quite right with my mom. Every single day is different.  The thing that caught me off guard earlier this year was her mood.  Complete silence from her to me.  I am mindful of my attitude to my mom and I am not sarcastic or critical of her and I help around the home and pay bills. I did nothing to warrant silence from her.   Then there were times when she was in the silence mode and she would rush around the home and grab her jacket and run from the house to go out walking.   The silence was something that was happening for a few months.  

The silence was the number 1 thing that caught me off guard earlier this year and I began to wonder if this could be dementia. 

Then there was other behaviours over the past 2/3/4 years that I think I can now piece together alongside the silence.  

Currently a type of OCD cleaning has taken her over.  Every single day with her - cleaning.  Also she's not able to comprehend the energy crisis and the there was little effort to reduce energy consumption.   I am nearly at a stage where I am going to have a heart attack at the machine.   60 degree loads with prewash and extra rinse.  Washing only one or two items at a time. The whole works.  There's no effort or understanding to reduce the energy consumption.  She's washing as if she's leaving severe disease on everything. 

There was a type of silliness over the past few years like buying more shoes when she has shoes, shoes, shoes, shoes.  She just wants more.  

Recently I read something that said when dementia is found, quite often dementia change have been happening for up to 10 years before diagnosis. 

Is that true? 

Looking back there were other things over the past few years.  Her reasoning was warpped over some issues over the past few years. For example she was not able to follow instructions from the vet when our dog was old and sick.  

Now, I am thinking if it's dementia and of it was setting in for years? I hope I am wrong.  I don't have time to be a carer to my mom.  And especially this.  I am trying to suggest to my mom to turn the temperature down on the washing machine and leave off the extra functions and it's not going down well.  She's looking for a fight from me when I try to conserve energy like this.","Yes…My father has vascular dementia. We have found many things he bought over the years doubled like tools or devices. Most were never used and more expensive than they should. So I guess it had been already affecting his judgment long ago.

Before diagnosis he was getting lonier. I mean spent his whole afternoon watching tv in the bedroom when he used to be far more active.  Shortly after the memory problems became clear and its been downhill ever since
For my mom (about 9 years before a formal diagnosis) it was missing things in movies or television. She would ask, Why don’t they do, XYZ… and I would say, They just said that they did follow through with XYZ, or The storyline did that 5 minutes ago. I know she has tinnitus so I thought maybe that was interfering with her hearing but looking back, she never used to miss big things in shows so if there are 10 year clues, those were likely hers.
HINDSIGHT! Yes, when I look back I see all of the signs. REM sleep disorder, putting things away so they will be safe (so safe we never found them), misplacing things, putting milk in the cupboard not the fridge, using the GPS to get home from a few blocks away, not recognizing familiar places, apathetic.  All sorts of signs but he was not actually diagnosed until 2 years ago.  He did well on neuro psych testing in 2018 and retested in 2020 and did not do so well. Anyway, knowing earlier would not have changed anything.
Technically, dementia is a cognitive impairment that substantially affects daily living, but it often follows years of (undetected) neurodegeneration and other, less obvious symptoms. The problem is that in most cases these symptoms are hard to distinguish from mental health issues including depression and the effects of stress or trauma. I would say nothing you describe screams dementia, but one wouldn't rule it out (there is a behavioural type of dementia which comes to mind: [https://www.theaftd.org/what-is-ftd/behavioral-variant-ftd-bvftd/](https://www.theaftd.org/what-is-ftd/behavioral-variant-ftd-bvftd/)).

Most cases of dementia are from Alzheimer's disease, where the most obvious symptoms are forgetfulness, word finding difficulties and (temporal) loss of spatial orientation.

If available, you can check for dementia, perhaps raising the possibility of frontotemporal dementia given her behaviour change, but it sounds like she could need help no matter whether it's dementia or not. All the best!
Just chiming in with one more bit of evidence that bears out a resounding ""yes."" 10 years ago, my partner started going batshit crazy on me, picking huge fights over nothing, working herself into towering rages for days—then apologizing profusely. Dx'd as mental illness. A few years later, suicide attempts, total anhedonia, loss of engagement with the world, passive limp noodle behavior. Now, Alzheimer's. 20/20 hindsight is part of the cruelty of this disease, because so many advance red flags can be attributed to something else.
So much of this only becomes clearer in hindsight. It’s been five years since seriously noticing changes, but a vascular dementia diagnosis was only last month, due to her refusal to see any doctor.

But there’s one long term behavior that sticks out - if she  mispronounced something or someone’s name, she could never “get” the correction, so we just gave up trying. And that was for many years before. 

So try to get your mom to a doctor. This can be slowed down and her behavior better managed. 

Good luck
Yes, I can certainly think of events from about ten years before mid-stage (when the drastic symptoms start). IME mood swings, selfishness, lack of empathy, disregard for etiquette, hoarding and/or throwing important stuff away, extreme stubbornness about random things, and susceptibility to scams are all behaviors that show up before obvious cognitive symptoms. All those items could be because of a bad day; or just be someone’s personality.  Missing or failing to remember details can also be ascribed to someone’s hearing loss or vision loss too. Which by the way should be addressed with glasses and hearing aids, if not already.

It sucks because often the patient became an asshole and burned all their relationships long before they have any medical symptoms.

Dementia,Advice needed on moving to a new memory care facility,"After four weeks at one facility, it’s become clear that this is not the best one for my wife. 

Not enough activities, despite a supposed calendar. Not enough residents to socialize with (she’s not too far “gone” and needs that). And the food is very mediocre - yesterday’s lunch was a slice of ham, some beans and some cabbage. Today was a piece of roast beef, mashed potatoes and overcooked string beans. Desserts have been some piece of a sweet cake with icing. I’ve yet to see a greasy vegetable or fruit. 

Went to see another one yesterday, a bit more expensive, but it was like night and day, with more people, more real activities, and a dining room and menu that actually looked and sounded appetizing. 

There’s a question whether she’ll “qualify” for the level just above the locked unity, but either way should be much, much better. 

Any advice on how to handle this with her? The Placement Consultant will take care of the details. I’ve arranged for lunch there with her next week, with a chat (not a full assessment yet) with the nurse to at least get a sense of which level and to give my wife some sense of control in all this. 

I’m especially wondering how to let her know that cooperation with the eventual assessment will be important for her time there. 

Thanks","If you were able to move her to the facility without much issue, then she may be good for a move again. As long as you stay positive and make the move sound like just another step in the journey, she should be fine. I’m guessing she hasn’t been in the facility for long enough to get settled
If you don't mind my asking, what do you mean by ""the level just above the locked unity""?  Is your wife in assisted living with additional care for memory support? Or do you mean a level of the locked memory care unit?

I ask, since we recently moved mom into assisted living and they are currently good with her at their lowest care level. Mom is not too far gone either, no wandering, dresses, bathes, eats, etc...just has no short term memory and needs a fair amount of prompting. I'm living in a state of anxiety about the eventual decline and need for memory care.

Since you're sharing costs, this is in Illinois and she is in a very nice facility, great food, great activities (however their activity director is currently on maternity leave, so it's slacking a bit) and we're paying $5850/month for a 1 bedroom unit at care level AL0 (goes up to AL6 for $7850). They also have a very nice memory care unit which starts at $6825 for studio at MC1 (goes up to $8275 for MC3). We're hoping Mom's physical shape stays great and can stay in AL0 for a while and then we'll cross the bridge into MC...

Dementia,Frustrated !!,"Has anyone ever had trouble getting a nursing home to take their loved one? My Grandpa has been living with us for 8 months and Mom finally admitted she couldn’t handle it anymore a month ago. We found a place close to my aunts , but they told us we had to wean him off the Seroquel and put him on Trazodone . Which would take about 3 weeks . The 3 weeks is almost up and my uncle and his wife came up to give Mom some help . They decided to take him to ER yesterday because he had a pretty bad hemmorhoid . The hospital decided to keep him for the night to take him off his blood thinners and monitor his hemoglobin so they could remove it . They haven’t done the surgery yet , but in the meantime my uncle decided to see if we could get him transferred from there to the nursing home. Which would make more sense since he was supposed to move next week . Our Comission on Aging Caseworker called the nursing home to get the process movin and now the nursing home is claiming the bed (that they said they’d hold for him is not available now . So either they lied and never intended to take him or we mistakenly thought they would hold the  bed. My Mom and aunt are very frustrated and wondering what to do next . I’m pissed because I feel like the nursing home doesn’t want to help and doesn’t give a FUCK about our situation !!!!","Hate to say it, but they most likely don’t care. It seems to me that even high level facilities are trying to admit people who will need the least amount of care. I’m not ready to place my husband with Parkinsons, but every Place I’ve checked out, says that if he wanders around at night, I will have to hire someone to come watch him. And yes, he wanders around at night. No way can I afford to pay their outrageous rates and also hire private care. If it were as easy as they seem to think to find someone to watch him overnight, I would hire help to come spend a few nights so I could get some rest. I’m wondering if your grandpa’s latest medical issues made them decide he would need too much care. They don’t want to provide more than the bare minimum. Hope you find a better place for him. It’s a cruel world.
My family went through this exact thing recently with my grandma. She was going to be moving to memory care in like two weeks, had the room reserved and everything, when she fell and fractured her neck. The memory care wouldn’t take her until her neck was somewhat healed so she had to stay in a nursing home for a few weeks first, but none of the nursing homes wanted her because of the dementia.
What does the social worker say? What would happen if you refused to take him home from the hospital? Would the hospital keep him until a home is found?  Would that place him on a priority list? That’s the way I would approach the current situation, if you take him home now he could be with you for months until you find another spot.
As a person in the early stage of Dementia whose been trying to get into an assisted living because I don't want to put my son through this. Earlier is better. I've (we've) been lied to, mislead, and accused of faking. I don't think they care. Maybe call adult protective services see if they can assist.
It could be a good thing if they’re basically saying they wouldn’t be able to handle him. Their staffing could be worse than usual right now. Have you been in touch with other nursing homes?
There are consultants that help you find a nursing facility within your family’s budget.  They help with the paperwork, etc. Ask the hospital’s social worker for a referral for a consultant.  They usually have a list.
Switching from seroquel to trazodone makes no sense.  I would bet half their patients are on Seroquel.

Dementia,"UK Based, how can I get my dad in a care home?","My dad was diagnosed back in 2018 with mixed dementia and Alzheimer’s. He has progressively gotten worse through the years to the point where it is near impossible to care for him at home. He recently spent 58 days in the hospital with A-symptomatic pneumonia. Do to being in bed for this length of time his mobility has gone completely. We have a hospital bed and carers that attend 4 times a day to help carry the burden, however recently he has declined even more, becoming both verbally and physically abusive towards myself and my mother. He has to use a catheter which he yanks about pretty much on a daily basis causing himself great pain. Yesterday he attempted to climb out of bed, but with no strength in his legs he would’ve hurt himself. He has become a danger to himself and others. I just don’t know what to do or who to turn to.

I’ve come to the realisation that the man who lays in bed, attempting to occasionally escape, yell obscenity’s and is all round miserable is not my dad, not really, not anymore, and I want not only what’s best for him going forward but for my mum.

Any help would be greatly appreciated","I'm in the UK. First you should speak to your local social services to get a financial assessment for care. It's really unlikely you'll get it, so you should prepare yourself for paying considerable bills - depending on where you are in the country it might be £1000 a week. 

I found Alzheimers Society ([https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/) ) incredibly helpful when I was going through this with my dad. They can advise about funding, what type of care he might need, recommend suitable homes and help you with your wellbeing too. I found the guilt of 'putting my dad in a home' very difficult to cope with at first but now I understand that it is by far the best place for him. 

Good luck
I'm also in UK - been through this with both my parents (mum still currently just about alive).  Phone up social services.  Use the phrase Vulnerable Adult as much as you can to get them to move (there's a duty of care if they're vulnerable).  You need to get a Needs Assessment as well as a financial grants one.  As well as alzheimers, dementia care (dementiauk.org) are wonderful.  Use their phone lines -they've got great really well trained people to talk through the nuts and bolts with you.  You do need to do this at this point.  The catheter alone is going to cause bacterial infections if he's messing with it - he's putting himself in harm's way.  In both cases, moving first dad and then mum to care (dad hospice, mum care home) was the right thing to do.  THey got the care they needed without risk of being hurt.  They also got a lot of stimulation and input from simply being in a busier place.  It also allowed GPs to make sure medication needed was happening - although i think you've got that covered with your current arrangements.  DM me if you want advice - i'm a teacher so will respond in the evenings.
I cant help with the UK as i dont live there but your decision is correct. ruining your lives will not improve your dad's well being, his condition is far gone enough that it absolutely warrants a suitable measure such as a care home.

how are his finances? I am sure that the main split in what you will do will be public vs private.
Are the carers supplied by local social services (or do you pay they privately)? - because if they are social services provided, there will already be a needs assessment in place. You just need to get it reviewed. I'm going to guess that your mum handled his stuff until now.

If she is not up to it, or you want to help out you could ring your local adult care team.

* (Google it or look for letters from them around the house) and say you want to request a needs assessment review. They will be able to find his plan from his name and address.
* Explain that everyone involved is suffering and the needs assessment needs reviewing asap. Highlight that you have serious concerns for both his safety and your mum's wellbeing (as he is being abusive).
* Point out when you don't understand what is being said. Do not feel the need to hide you are now also focusing on protecting your mum as well as your dads wellbeing. Be persistent, but try not to get overly emotional with the staff you speak to.
* Make notes of what is being said during the phone call and the assessment as you may not take it all in at the time. It will also help you if you want to post back here to update and / or ask for input.

An urgent needs assessment should be really quite quick. within a week if not a few days.

You might want to consider filming some of his behaviour (but please try to manage his dignity in doing so (no nudity or humiliation) and try to avoid letting him know he is being filmed, especially if you think he will try to act differently around the assessment team.

Prepare your mum for where this is all going. Take some time off work if relevant. Be kind to yourself. and ask for help if you need it.",2022-05-03 04:10:56,BeardedH090916,uhb8rq
Dementia,I said some mean things to my grandma,"I (27m) live with my grandma (78f) to take care of her house, chores, and animals. It’s been two years now and while there have been wonderful times that I will always cherish, not everyday is a good one. Sometimes we argue, usually about things that didn’t happen, and it can be very hard to de-escalate. Tonight was one of those nights and she kept following me to argue and call me names. I ended up yelling at her and saying something really mean. She said something to the effect of her killing herself to spite me and I said that I wished she would. It just slipped out. She just went to sit down on the couch and fell asleep within minutes after. I’ve been sitting here feeling terrible ever since. I don’t like that I let myself say something like that. 

How do you guys de-escalate situations like that? I’ve had knives pulled on me a few times before I decided to hide them. I just don’t want fight with her like this anymore.","Don't be too hard on yourself. It's really hard to be verbally and physically attacked by someone that you're trying so hard to take care of and they just don't see it. And on the plus side it's unlikely that she will remember it. What I do doesn't always work but the key is for me personally is not to get sucked into it. My dad loves to argue and fight that's just the way its always been for him. He'll usually say something mean or antagonistic, or falsely accuse me of something. Lot of times I just let it go, or I agree, or make something up, or basically just say whatever it takes to get him to move on. Truth is completely immaterial in most cases because they're not going to remember and it's not really going to make any sense to them anyway. What is a good diverting tactic for her? My dad loves to eat constantly all day long so if I can suggest something to eat that usually changes his mind immediately. Your grandmother might have something else that works for her. Or sometimes just no response whatsoever. And when I'm really over it I'll start singing. He just looks at me like I'm crazy, but why not right, that makes two of us 😁.
I'm so sorry you're experiencing this.  It's hard to deescalate in the heat of the moment.  Try to disengage.  Take deep, slow breaths. Walk away.

It sounds like you and your grandmother are stuck in a pattern, and the secret will be breaking that pattern. You're posting in the dementia thread, so if your grandmother has that, often it's just a matter of playing in to the psychosis rather than challenging it. What happens if you apologize for whatever she thinks you've done?  Can you go out and (fake) fix whatever happened?  Creative solutions can help both of you move on.  Stop trying to get on the same page of reality: you two don't share one.
You can take this as a learning curve. Remembering that she is ill when she says things that can lead to argument is a good step. That being said, I don't know if I can give you much advice except to try and keep quiet when you feel angry. “If any of you becomes angry and he is standing, let him sit down, so his anger will go away; if it does not go away, let him lie down.” -Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)
DO NOT beat yourself up over this.  As a caretaker you need balls of steel and even then they will fail you at times.  I lost control a couple of weeks ago and screamed at my husband, screamed like I was totally crazy and he hadn't really done anything, I just happened to lose my last nerve.  We are human, we are imperfect, we sometimes fail under so much stress and pressure.  We are trying so hard to take care of a loved one who makes no sense and can be so mean.  Just let it go and know that sometimes we just can't hold it together.  Take care of yourself.
One time my grandma told me to kill my self after I just got home from the hospital. I told her I’d do it right in front of her and I wish I never said that but I was so angry with her, but still I wish so badly I could have controlled myself better and just shut up. A few minutes later she asked me for her cookies (we always buy her cookies and have to hide them or she will eat only cookies). Some thing that I have learned moving forward is make gentle suggestions like if she wants to do something she really shouldn’t I ask her well maybe we can watch a bit or tv or how about we talk about types of flowers instead. Another thing is what I call “eating shit” or just agree to agree, sometimes it’s just easier to sort of nod my head and say yes even though it is very frustrating it seems to help a fair bit. Sometimes when she’s off on a rampage and I take care of her I put a camping chair outside on the patio or in the yard where I can see her through the window and I’ll take some time to calm myself down and give her time to herself sort of like w break but I can still see her so I know where she is and thar she’s okay hasn’t fallen or anything.
Does she ever remind you of other people, when she is nasty and fights with you over stuff that didn't happen?

My mom has reminded me of a former coworker of mine, sometimes, when she has done this; I wondered, if she did some occult ritual, which affects mom's behavior.

I have schizophrenia, and I think the occult causes SZ and dementia, also.",2022-05-02 22:32:17,uhhh-wood,uh654l
Dementia,Moms short term is GONE. HOW do I handle this?,She showed signs in 2014. By 2020 I forced her to a Dr. Early stages then. By end of 2021 she couldn’t live alone. Now she’s beginning to have a LITTLE difficulty running the shower etc.  But her short term is GONE. The EXACT same questions over and over and over. Every few min or less. I am losing it. This is on top of losing my stepmom after being her hospice nurse for 3 months. And now my dads SEVERE hypochondria asking me if he’s dying 100x a day. I’ve been caretaking everyone for 2 years. I’m losing it. But this post is specifically : HOW DO I DEAL WITH THE SAME QUESTION EVERY 5 SECONDS?!! Do you people have the patience of a saint? I’m pretty good. And she (was) my best friend. But this is. It’s all ruining my life. With covid. And I might as well quit.,"Caregiving is HARD. And that’s an understatement. 
I’ve specialized in dementia care for years, and have also cared for loved ones on a personal level. 
It’s HARD. 
As annoying as it may become, just answer her questions over and over again. If it’s something totally off the wall, don’t push for her to believe the truth. If she says “When is my dad coming to visit?” And dad has been gone for years, just answer vaguely. It won’t hurt her, as she won’t remember. But it will calm and redirect her in the moment. “He’ll come see you after work.” “He’s traveling but is excited to see you when he gets back.” “I know you miss him, he misses you so much too!”
Also, redirection. When she asks a question for the 10th time, even if she just asks what time it is, offer her something to do. “Can you help me fold the laundry?” “It’s a beautiful day! Let’s sit outside for a while.” 
Talk with her. Tell her stories. About your kids. Your career. Anything at all. It’ll redirect her to another topic. If you’re super busy, and need to get the laundry done, get your work done, just need to sit alone for a few…don’t be afraid to do that as long as she’s safe. “I have to switch the laundry over but I’ll be back soon.””I have a meeting, I’ll see you after.” 
So much of dementia is distraction. 
You’re an amazing person for caring for them all. It’s a tough job.
Depends on the question or topic - different ones can be handled different ways. If her eyesight is still good, you can print out a FAQ and post it on the wall or her door or someplace she'll see it (when my dad visited my brother in another state, brother put up a sign with his family's names, the state he was in, etc so dad could ""refresh"" his memory without asking constantly). 

If it's questions about upcoming appointments or something, I never figured out a way to keep reminding them. In the end, we basically stopped telling them about upcoming events or appointments. We'd just have him shower, get dressed, and hop in the car like they were going to the store or whatever. 

At some point I came to the realization that they aren't doing it on purpose. Their behavior isn't intentionally antagonizing, even though it *is* frustrating, so I was able to handle it better. Self-care is a big part of that, too - no matter how good you are at redirecting and deflecting, you need a break from time to time.
REDIRECTION is your friend.  Doesn't always work on the first try, but if you can redirect them to something they like, it works pretty well for us. 

Ask them a different question back. 

Also put out photo albums and change them out regularly so you don't get shown the same stuff. They love to reminisce and are more capable of this as long term memory is better. 

And I hate to say this bc you've probably already learned this, but you almost have to bully people into helping you. When you ask people to come by more often and they say they will be better about it put them on the spot by adding a visit on a calendar and send them a reminder. 

Good luck to you.
I suffer through this too. I answer a few times, then I use distraction. Giving her a task, taking her out to sit on the porch, looking at a photo album, music, jigsaw puzzles have helped me. She has an electronic photo frame that she loves. This is the hardest thing we’ll ever do.
My mom does this too. With the repeat questions. I am pretty tightly wound most of the time but this has forced me to give a little grace. My sister actually had a really good coping mechanism for the frustration. She said it may be annoying to us but to her this is the first time, every time, that she gets to share this with you and that brings her joy. As long as she’s happy and nothing she is doing is hurting her or anyone else, that’s what matters. Share her joy with her if possible. It’s very hard to do some days!
You need help, talk to your doctor about getting social services to help you out and getting a provider.
My wife's short term memory has suddenly significantly degraded.  Don't know why but she's also exhibiting  more confusion.  She doesn't want to see anymore doctors and I don't want an argument, though IMO she could use another assessment.  

I'm prone to irritability due to bipolar illness and sometimes I'm not understanding or accepting of her behaviors.  I feel bad about that.  She's ill, just like I'm ill and my wife had to come to terms with me.  I'm getting used to her repeating questions multiple times a day.  We do laugh, together, about her memory lapses, but I know too much having seen dementia in her family, to think that it's going to remain low level or benign.
My blood pressure medication had to be raised since I've become my dads caregiver.  

I have started something that has made me feel way better though even if it doesn't solve all problems.

I give my dad more entertainment tasks he really likes that I don't have to participate in.  Like these are 2 movies he loves to watch.  He doesn't ever bother me when he's watching them.  Tv isn't the greatest for them but I've learned that I need to balance what's good for my dad with what's good for me.  I can't forget me.

I typically put on my virtual reality headset and play my own games while he's busy doing his thing.  It's like I'm not even with my dad when im wearing that headset., I'm scuba diving with tons of beautiful sealife.  The speakers are off ear so I can hear my dad enough that if hes is in trouble I know.  I think it can be set so if he enters my play boundary, I can see him through passthrough cameras.  So he can't run off and cause trouble.

I sometimes just put on noise canceling headphones and listen to my own music/watch YouTube on my own tablet while dad is busy with his thing too.

Another thing is to try to understand the root cause of why she keeps repeating that question and fix it.  Like if she's repeating that question cause she misses someone, arrange time with them.",2022-05-02 20:35:28,No_Detective_2317,uh3yq7
Dementia,"I’m working on a puzzle memory toy for patients with dementia on my Major Design Project for my final year of school. I wondered if this is an appropriate site to receive feedback on my design, anything would be beneficial and assist me greatly.",,"These look like a puzzle of some sort and would be way too comples for most dementia patients.
This is absolutely too complex. Sorry.
Your idea is sweet, but to be frank I'm not sure how useful it would be. A person with dementia, unless it's very early on, isn't going to learn how to put together a puzzle. (My mum was an artist before she got sick and became unable to use a paintbrush... You don't just lose memories, you lose skills, reasoning, the ability to focus, and so much more.) But if you're keen on the idea of a puzzle, you might consider materials that offer a sensory experience... A different material for each puzzle piece. Sometimes stuff that stimulates the senses can be very soothing for folks with dementia. (Your image looks like a 3D puzzle, so my suggestions are based on that understanding...) Maybe wrap one piece in satin, another made of sheepskin, one covered in sequins, another made of wood... Something that feels interesting might hold the attention of a person with dementia a little longer. *Might.* Your puzzle could then exist as a kind of an art piece that would look interesting on a coffee table, that could be put together by a person before they have dementia (or very early in their progression), and then offer a tactile sensory experience to a person with advanced dementia. Maybe?
My husband cannot always get dressed by himself, can't cook, can't do math, can't put anything together, can't figure out how to put a screw in, puts the milk in the cupboard instead of the fridge.  Something like this puzzle would sit unused, way too complicated for someone with dementia.
I give you huge credit for seeking feedback on an activity for folks with dementia! I feel a lot of things are designed “for” them but not with their input or from their families. I work with caregivers to implement activities in the home. The last one (large flat puzzle) may be okay, I found that large pieces and puzzles some folks are able to do. But remember, with dementia and activities the key is not the outcome, it’s about the enjoyment in the moment and the mental/social/emotional stimulation. So even if someone was doing this puzzle and did not complete it, but they had fun or were stimulated by the colors or shapes, then it is a success. Think about your target audience: early or middle stage? Activities towards the middle stage tend to be about adapting their hobbies, like gardening or painting or something, so they can enjoy what they can still do. One suggestion I have is that the brown may not be enough contrast. Color is essential in the middle to later stages, especially color contrast. Vibrant and fun colors will get the person’s attention, brown may fade into the background and they won’t see it. Something to consider. Again, you rock for asking for input, and this is a great idea!
I like the design and the puzzle. But I have to question why this would be designed for people with dementia, specifically? If this is just for a design or art project, it's pretty cool. However, I'm not sure what would make it specific for those with severe memory issues?

Is there something I'm missing? Like studies showing this particular design has been enriching to the mind?

Unfortunately, from what I can tell from your pictures, and from having a dad in a bad state with this illness,  I would love this, but this would not be a fun ""toy"" for him, it would be a frustrating chore.
This product choice was inspired from the passing of my grandmothers best friend.
Beautiful, but too difficult. My mother loved jigsaw puzzles. By mid stages she was only able to do 500 piece if I split the pieces into sections for her. In later stages it was 36 piece puzzles and then those separated into fourths. By the late stage, she just tried to eat her 26 piece puzzle. Visual perception is compromised in the disease. That would make some of your designs all but impossible unless the dementia was very mild. Problem solving is one of the first things affected as well.
Just some feedback: As many have pointed out dementia impacts basic cognitive skills so a lot of these “memory challenging” activities end up being inappropriate for practical use causing frustration and damage to self-esteem. While cognitive stimulation is an emerging area in dementia care, this would mostly surround conversation as opposed to visual/physical tasks. Some specific cases in early stages may benefit from this task but nothing about the design makes it any more appropriate than any other generic “brain teaser” game. Please note this is not to come across as harsh it’s just to ensure you’re informed about dementia and the impairments it brings because if you were to present this to an examiner with any familiarity with dementia I could see it going down poorly and if you have to have a piece of writing accompanying this, you will need to have a good understanding of dementia in order to argue your products relevance.

The design is pretty (I personally love wooden brain teasers, my boyfriend’s uncle has many of them and they are always good fun) and if your heart is set on that I would stick with it and just avoid marketing it as specifically for dementia use as I would assume “Major design” projects would take into account viability of the product and anyone with experience of dementia would see that it’s not viable (taking into account 7 principles of universal design). Sticking with the current design, maybe target it towards children in later part of primary/elementary school as a visual perception/problem solving development tool. 

It’s important to understand dementia is not just about memory loss, it’s an umbrella terms for many different diseases that impact brain function. Many of these diseases can impact peoples vision or visual processing and so people with difficulties differentiating a toilet bowl with a sink will have great difficulty differentiating many similar wooden pieces.  There’s no/little colour contrast between the back board of the second design and the pieces used to fill it. If there was any chance of it being used that would have to be amended (look up dementia simulators on YouTube. They’re used to build empathy in caregivers and will give you an idea of some difficulties encountered with certain forms of dementia)

With an OT background I’d definitely be looking at an activity suitable for grading/scaffolding so it can be adapted to the persons needs. Dementia is a progressive disease and capabilities can fluctuate day-to-day and even hour-to-hour. I’m not sure what this would look like but it would be super practical and majorly beneficial in its design. The activity should help build self-esteem and present the opportunity for mastery as many people with dementia struggle to find that feeling in every day life.

All the best with your project!
I agree with the majority about the second puzzle being best! It could use some colour tho!

A good “puzzle” imo, would be something where any piece would fit together in a tray platform like the second one- if they can all fit together in some way that would limit frustration and promote accomplishments a little better (-:
I agree with the general opinion in this thread, you have to consider visuospatial impairment in dementia. Also, the effect of a fun activity is more valuable than that of ""brain training"" of this kind for which there is no strong evidence that it helps.

To add more constructive criticism, perhaps consider a puzzle with multiple solutions? Perhaps there is even something clever one can do where each solution results in a different (but complete) image or pattern.

(I am a dementia researcher)
Are these flat wooden shapes in a flat tray? I think it’s a wonderful idea for people with early to mid stage dementia. I’m life enrichment assistant (activity leader) in a dementia unit, and probably 4-7 of my current 28 residents would be able to use and enjoy this. As long as every single piece is too big to go in a mouth (about toilet paper roll sized), it could even be something I can leave them with unattended.

Edit: I see the first one is more like a 3D puzzle cube- that one would be pretty difficult for all of my residents.
Very kind and thoughtful of you to try and help people with dementia.  I would however suggest you learn more about your target group first.
First off...Thank you!!!! There is almost nothing on the market for dementia patients specifically. Second it really does depend what stage the person is in. Early this is pretty neat, if you're looking to more advanced, definitely go with the sensory comment below. A reactive device would work as well... different reactions for different areas touched...lights sounds. To be blunt think along the lines of what a toddler or younger could engage in independently and be stimulated. Also no separate pieces, they will get lost.
Just to say great motivation and focus for your project. 

I think some of the other comments are a little harsh (especially considering you’re still at school and doesn’t sound like you have a lot of personal experience with dementia) but they are correct in saying that this is not the right design direction to take. 

Puzzles can be great in earlier stages of dementia’s but not once cognitive and physical decline really set in. Fine motor skills in particular can be affected. Vision impairments also make it really hard to differentiate between similar colours. 

With my dad ‘puzzles’ that he found beneficial were sorting based (he loved to keep things neat and tidy before any symptoms set in), we would set him tasks like ‘sort these Lego bricks into colours’. It would keep him occupied but would also give him a sense of purpose which helped to improve his mood. 

We used Lego because it was brightly coloured and high contrast and was suitable for his motor function at the time. 

Activities for people with dementia work best when they are targeted to the individual, what you have designed might be beneficial to someone with dementia but if it is it will be because it is something that they would have enjoyed before their decline, rather than being a tool to specifically help with their memory symptoms. 

When planning dementia activities it’s important to take into account the persons cognitive and physical ability, if something is too complicated it will lead to frustration and end up having the opposite affect than intended. Activities are best when they are specific to a person, have a goal (and can provide a sense of purpose) and are suitable for a persons ability level. 

Something like a very simple, brightly coloured, high contrast picture to put back together would be more appropriate than an intricate, all wooden, complex puzzle. 

It’s also important to remember that touch is an extremely important sense in these cases, using different textures will be more mentally stimulating. 

Have a look at dementia busy boards, they aren’t beneficial for everyone with dementia but those that benefit from them can really enjoy them (my dad also enjoyed them). 

I’m also guessing that for your major work you need to fulfil a few WIP goals and outcomes for your design process, your designs here are great and shouldn’t go to waste but you can frame them as upon further research you decided to go in another direction. 

Great start and good on you for coming to a community like this for feedback, would love to see how your final design turns out!

Good luck!

(I work in dementia care and have three close family members that have/had dementia)
What exactly is your goal and who is this meant for? People who already have dementia or people in early stages?

How old are you and in which country do you live?

I‘m happy to help and you can message me any time. I think we all need a little more information.
I wish I could help but that ship has sailed with my dad. Good luck.
Sorry but, these puzzles do not even make any sense, for a person living with memory loss, for someone with dementia.  They would be confusing, difficult, horrible experience.

The pieces are bland, boring, uninteresting, and nothing to differentiate between the pieces or where/how they need to fit together.  Just a jumble of random different shapes.

There is no interesting or enjoyable aim to the task.  ie they don't complete an interesting or colourful or meaningful picture or diagram or recognisable object or item.

Even for people with very mild early-stages memory loss, I can't see any reason why they would want to even pick up one of these, much less work it out.

For people past early stages, even trying to explain to them that a) it's a puzzle and b) instructions  of 'fit the pieces together to make a whole piece' -- would generate 'but why?'  and 'but what does the whole thing look like?'.

A puzzle 'memory' toy - I don't even understand where or what the 'memory' aspect is supposed to be - there is none.

Like, nice try, good on you, but this is senseless, dead boring and traumatising.  The most fun to be gained from these puzzles would be setting them on fire & watching them burn to ashes.

Thanks but no thanks.  1000% would not recommend.

1000% recommend you re-tailor the target puzzle-solver to some other folk, and/or work out a way to make it interesting &/ meaningful.    best of luck!",2022-05-02 19:11:55,MegaPEPE_,uh2dr6
Dementia,False memories?,"Are false memories a major sign of dementia or Alzheimer's? My stepmother told me a story about meeting Vladimir Putin in Columbus Ohio.  Without getting into the details of the scenario she has now told me (and others) several times, I know this never happened.  This past weekend I was visiting and found where she had written down ""My Putin Story"" on a notepad.  She told me that everyone that she tells is just in disbelief and amazed (probably more concerned in reality).  She is also showing other troubling signs such as forgetting to pay an annual bill (one that she has paid since 1996) that is now in collections and I am trying to deal with.

While I am typing this, I am kind of answering my own question, but any advice?  Do I try to tell her that Putin has never been to Ohio and specifically to the event that she thinks she met him at or will that make her more confused?","I don't think there is any need to talk her out of this delusion, but it is a potential warning sign. Delusions are quite common in Alzheimer's disease. This one is a bit more complicated than those usually seen, like my house is not my home, or someone is stealing from me. The financial error is more concerning, and also could be a warning sign. It suggests that you should pay very close attention to her to see if there are other problems that you did not notice.  Someone should be reviewing her finances regularly. Check on how she is keeping the house, cooking, eating, etc. If she and you are lucky everything could be  OK, but it's important not to take any chances.
My mother with Diffuse Levy Body Dementia has some serious delusions. But in retrospect it started years ago with altered memories. Like she’d tell a story that I knew had some truth to it, but some facts were wrong, or the people were wrong. And the fabricated bits were often malicious motives the she ascribed to people or things that they said in her false memory. Really negative paranoid stuff. I agree that going along with a fantastical story is less upsetting than arguing as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone. But for me I couldn’t go along with my mother’s paranoid delusions because they were about current people and situations. Especially me. Good luck.
That was certainly one of the earlier signs with my mom. We were watching a documentary about an old west bounty hunter who had the same last name as her aunt's husband. Over the course of the show she went from, ""Oh, I wonder if they're related?"" to believing that her uncle had rescued him from the gallows (nevermind that he would have been a toddler, at most, when this guy was hanged) secretly took care of him the rest of his life, and told my mom on his deathbed that he wanted her to tell the world that this outlaw had survived. She even claimed to have met this man when she was a teenager, and ""remembered"" the cold look in his eye, and the scar from the rope around his neck.

This had been preceded by increased difficulty paying her bills, which we had mostly dismissed as being an issue with adjusting to new technology, and an increasing tendency to ask the same questions more than once. 

Contradicting her won't be helpful, unfortunately. The thing with delusions is, they're as real to that person as your most cherished memories are to you, and logic doesn't play a role. I'm sorry.
False beliefs like this are a worrying sign, yes. My dad started with these odd little stories that didn't make sense but weren't so totally far-out that they weren't plausible. His delusions gradually got more and more out there, but they started with little mix-ups and confabulations. Your stepmom's are definitely, uh, original. It sounds like she might be watching the news and kind of building a delusion out from there. If possible, I would try to limit her news consumption. News was a MAJOR source of my dad's delusions - he'd watch it and then somehow invent some story where he was directly involved with whatever he watched. Since so much of cable news is upsetting, the delusions ended up also being upsetting to him, so we had to really monitor and manage his TV consumption.  
As to how to deal with it, it really varies from person to person. You can try arguing with her and re-orienting her to reality, but fair warning, that seldom works. Sometimes changing the subject, distracting or redirecting works. Other times, you can kind of ignore it and let it play out. If she has any self-insight at all, reason might work to some extent. If there's any way ""in"" to the delusion without feeding into it too much (like, if someone has a paranoid delusion that thieves are trying to break in, telling them the police are watching the house might help settle them down), you could also try that. You have to play it by ear. Meds can also help, but you should only try anti-psychotics under the management of a good neurologist/neuro-psych, because they can have nasty side effects.
As others have mentioned, I would take note of this, and perhaps if you are able go with her to her family doctor to discuss screening. 

My father with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia started madly writing things down when things started to slide. He would write down what he’d want to tell me when he called. He would even wake up in the middle of the night and write down the time (I.e. 12:03, 12:09, 12:12, 12:29, 1:01, 1:02,1:44, etc…) he also started to do this with his Fitbit to count how many steps each day he’d walk. 

Perhaps it is a change in her medication or something unrelated, but best to get started early just in case :)
Hi, my father has vascular dementia and he always makes up stories. I just go along with whatever he says bc usually he drops the subject  , he still thinks some ppl are alive and were lying to him when we correct him so, I just go along with the story bc what they say is their truth...... I hope this helps
Boy my grandmaw can tell some stories like that. She has dementia.
I wouldn't argue with her but when she left the room her Putin Story would quietly disappear and I'd try to redirect conversation if it came up in hopes that she'd forget it soon.
 I would LOVE to hear the Putin in Columbus story!  Putin is so relevant now.  and so evil.
My mom definitely ""remembers"" things that never happened. I just let her believe it.",2022-05-02 17:18:11,jabberwocky1972,ugzzf3

Dementia,Made me smile,"Last night, after a long, stressful weekend with my mother, she did something that made me smile. When I was a younger, she used to sing a little song to me as a goodnight. “See you in the morning!”, to the tune of singing in the bathtub. I always answered back”la de da de da”

She sang that little tune to me last night after I tucked her in bed. I answered back with my part and we both giggled. I love my mom ☺️","I’m the caregiver for my mother who has Alzheimer’s. Lately after helping her into her pajamas at night, when it’s time for her to get into bed she decides she’s not sleepy. She’ll say “why do I have to go to sleep?” “Sleeping is stupid!” or a plaintive “I never get to have any fun.” It’s just like listening to my 6 year old self and I have to hold back the laughter. I tuck her in and tell her I love her and she’s asleep when I check on her five minutes later. Total role reversal. I love her so much and cherish these times.
Wonderful. Remember those moments. They will become more and more dear to you.
Love this!
That's beautiful, made me smile too.
Awww that is so wonderful and sweet❤ Its moments like that you'll cherish always and that make the difficult moments a bit lighter to shoulder.
I'm so happy you got to have this moment.

Dementia,"I lost my father to an incredibly long battle with Alzheimer's, then wrote an essay to help others navigate the overwhelming journey of caring for a loved one with the disease, which was recently published. I hope you will read it.","I lost my father after an incredibly long battle with Alzheimer's about 15 months ago.

Wanting to help others finding themselves in the same horrible situation, I wrote an essay about the experience, which was recently published.

I wrote it not only to tell my story, but to provide insight, guidance, resources, and to offer a glimpse into how Alzheimer’s can affect not only those afflicted with the disease, but — almost more importantly — their loved ones, because it is they who bear the deepest burden and suffering. 

Above all, I wrote it to help people navigate the devastating and overwhelming journey of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's. 

Here is a quote from Greg O'Brien, author of On Pluto: Inside the Mind of Alzheimer's:

*""Excellent piece, Darren. Excellent! Hoping as many people as possible will read your words. You have great insight, a gift the world needs to hear.""*

I hope you will read the essay and hope that it helps you. And please feel free to share it in any capacity.

Thank you and all the best,

I hear you. This sub has been a lifeline that I didn't know I so badly needed. Sending love & support to everyone here. Thinking about you today as we go in to see my Mom in her Memory Care unit - in the middle of another Covid Outbreak. Xo
Can I ask question about my mother (82yo)
Is it normal for a person dementia to be just down right mean to their caretaker and absolutely sweet to everybody else?
Likewise, this sub is a great place.

IMO the best parts of reddit is the support subs when you eventually have to deal with that turd sandwich life deals you.  So positive and supportive. 

Next would be the hobby subs, but even some of those can be 
hoity-toity depending on the hobby.

Dementia,My mom is in the final stages of dying...hours or a few days,"It's been a rough last 8 years. I'm my mom's primary caregiver since my dad passed away in 2014. Through it all, my mom, for the most part, remained a sweetie (she had her moments of course...always been independent since a her teens and hated being doted on by the professional caregivers we had coming to the house to help me out), even as the disease progressed. She contracted COVID-19, somehow, in February (I think at the dentist office) and was placed in home hospice. It looked as though she might improve to the point of graduating out of hospice, but things suddenly went downhill overnight. Yesterday evening, she was laughing at some old Three Stooges videos that I was playing for her. When I changed her at 4 AM she was responsive. But, this morning at around 11 AM, she wouldn't wake up. She seemed to know that I was there since she would move her thumb on my hand and squeeze it when I held hers, and her eyes opened slightly. The hospice nurse arrived, took her vitals, and stated that she's in the final phase, that her body is in the process of shutting down. They gave her some morphine since she seemed a bit agitated. This seemed to ease her. Anyway, she seems to be resting peacefully, and that's where I'm at. I don't know what to do.

Edit - I'm on the verge of crying but can't quite.","Just be with her, talk to her, say anything you've ever wanted to say to her. 
I'm so sorry for what you're going through. It's not easy.
i am so sorry to hear this, but I also understand it is inevitable and ultimately a release from this terrible disease.

All strength to you today and in the coming days, weeks, months.  It can take a while.

\*virtual hug\*
Hugs. Wishing you strength and comfort.
When my dad was in his last stages he communicated by hand squeezes. He could hear me. He knew what was going on. 

I lay beside him talking to him. When all was quiet and peaceful, he slipped away ever so gently. 

I’m proud I could do that for my dad. 

Just be there. 
Talk to her. 
Play some soft music. 
Tell her you love her.
One thing i did for my dad was played his favorite music. He was unresponsive but I thought what the hell and asked hey, move your foot if you're enjoying the music and he did. Even if you think she isn't aware she may be able to hear your words, or even music she enjoys.
Just hold her and love on her as she slips away.  She will feel you and that will ease her transition.  Peace.
Sending you love and support
Hold her hand, talk to her, play her favorite music. Wishing you peace and comfort.
These things are always sad.  Unfortunately, been there before with my father.  In the last week of his life, I was kissing him on his forehead and hugging him (in his eyes, he looked like he had some moments of clarity), after we put him to bed.  However, we didn't expect him to pass that soon.  As a man, who was raised in a culture where we don't particularly show affection. I'm glad I got to do it while he still here. 

Yes, definitely stay with your mother in what maybe her last moments.",2022-05-02 03:46:54,Sm4sh3r88,ugkebx
Dementia,A story about my father in law. advice welcomed.,"I would first like to preface this by saying I'm not sure if it belongs here. My goal is to get some advice on how to deal with the situation that my fiancee and I have found ourselves in. This is most likely going to be long, so please buckle up. 

My fiancee's mother passed in February of 21. She had very advanced coronary artery disease, to the point that many of her organs had atrophied prior to her death from lack of blood flow. She knew she was dying for several months prior to her death; her personal preference was to keep this to herself. She was refusing medical care by the end, and insisted that no one could know. Which means that my father in law, her husband of 45+ years, couldn't tell anyone, either. 

My fiancee had an idea that something was going on, and left at 250k+ a year job to move closer in December of 2020. His mother passed in Feb of 21. He was pretty sure that his father wouldn't do well after his mother passed. And he was right, though it took a while to manifest, and even then, it would have been impossible to predict exactly how badly it was going to go. 

His dad, we will call him Jimmy, did okay for a while. My fiancee would go stay on weekends at his apartment for a while, and help him with various tasks related to bill paying ect. Jimmy was confident that he would fail the driving test required for him to keep his driver's license, so he agreed when we offered to let him move into our house. 

When Jimmy moved in with us, he was mostly in possession of his mental faculties. He would, however, occasionally tell stories about things that had never happened. It was clear that he really believed that these things had happened, but no one else had any memory of these things. For example, he told a story about how I had taken him to a goat farm, where one of the goats had headbutted him in the nuts. This never happened. I assumed something similar must have happened with a previous partner of my fiancee's. This turned out to not be the case, and just the first symptom. 

This year, Jimmy experienced the first anniversary of his wife's death. We were prepared for a bad time on that day. much to our relief, it seemed to pass like any other day. We began to look forward to Jimmy's 80th birthday two weeks later. We had no way of knowing that nothing would be the same again.

On Jimmy's 80th birthday, we had plans to go out for dinner to celebrate. Those plans never happened. Because the morning of his birthday, Jimmy woke up convinced that the police were coming to arrest him. He'd apparently witnessed a dog being hit by a car, and snapped the dog's neck to put it out of his misery. (he'd recently watched the first episode of house of cards, which is where I believe he got the idea) he was also convinced that a giant conspiracy existed between his late wife's doctors, and all of his friends, to pin the death of his late wife on him. We hoped that it was just the stress of the one year anniversary and his 80th birthday causing a little confusion. That turned out not to be the case. 

Jimmy has had very few lucid periods since then. We took him to the doctor who prescribed Seroquil, an anti-psychotic medication to help with his delusions. He took it for a few days, before he became convinced that the medication was a placebo, and decided to test it by taking the entire bottle. Luckily this was not enough to kill him. Following that incident, we declined to renew his prescription. 

Jimmy had a few doctors appointments after that, where various labs were drawn. All of his labs came back stellar, particularly for someone of his age. Eventually we convinced his primary to do a brain MRI - this also came back completely normal. 

Meanwhile, Jimmy has been living in a false reality where literally everyone is out to get him. He insists that all the shades in the house be drawn; he's pointed out to me on numerous occasions the police officers camped in our back yard. Every noise is the signal for them to invade our house. One morning at 5 am he came into our room to tell us that the cops had the 'hoot owl' in the yard, and that was the signal. Other times it is the train, or the medical helicopter going to the hospital that is a mile up the road. 

We were hoping, especially as we have never received a diagnosis, that this was a temporary psychotic break. However, we are almost three months in, and things seem to be getting worse instead of better. Recently, Jimmy told my fiancee that he raped me, and I gave him syphilis. (This is, of course, not true, the same as everything else he believes at this point.) He's also convinced that the neighbors have made him run a gauntlet around the neighborhood where he's had to stick his hand in a hot grill and fend off multiple snakes. 

He absolutely refuses to go to any kind of doctor at this point, because he's convinced they're in on the conspiracy. There is no reasoning with him whatsoever. He's also dropped an alarming amount of weight, because he refuses to eat for long stretches of time.

What do I do? I'm not qualified to take care of a person like this, and it's literally destroying my partner. He's a constant anxious wreck, and I don't blame him. I just need some help. What do we do?","I only have a small amount of advice to offer as your story is a fair bit different than mine.  


You mentioned that he got an idea from House of Cards. In the first couple years or so after my mum's diagnosis we realised that she was confusing what she saw on the TV with what was reality. She confused the main character in a crime drama with my father.   


We figured out pretty quickly that if we kept whatever she was watching to something light and happy, she wouldn't have such severe cases of psychosis. Having said that, it didn't get rid of her psychosis completely, and that stage of her illness lasted about 2 dreadful and stressful years.   


Your last paragraph I think defines the issue at hand perfectly. You're not qualified. It's destroying your partner. Your father in law help needs help, and there's absolutely no shame in getting that help (whether it be a home or a carer).   


One of the hardest, but most important things I learned in my journey is doing what the healthy version of them would want, even if it felt like betrayal at the time for me. How would Jimmy from 5 years ago react to what's going on, and what would he want to happen to ensure you and your partner have a beautiful life? That's the answer.
Wow. That must be so difficult. I spent time with a former teacher over Christmas who had taken care of her husband for five years during his decline to dementia, and she told a lot of stories that sounded like yours. She and her extended family developed a number of coping mechanisms to deal with various psychosis. Having to check all outbuildings every night was one of them. So a trusted neighbor offered to do it (he didn’t) and then called to report that everything was ok. That problem was resolved. My teacher strongly recommended the book “the 36 hour day” which she said was a tremendous resource for her. Keep posting, keep sharing, and keep looking for ways to make things easier. It only goes downhill from here, I’m afraid.
Google advanced center on aging in your state or county to see what local services are available. At a minimum you may find support services to call for advice but hopefully a social worker who can help you navigate this. Maybe someone can do an at-home visit and help you move forward with whatever the next step is. 

Your husband might benefit from a support group or a therapist as well— so he can let out his frustrations/fear/stresses in a safe place. 

Be kind to yourself. This stuff is not easy.

Edit: partner, sorry
Oh gosh so sorry you all are experiencing this, it's very hard, and sad.  Contact dementia org &/ alzheimers org for expert professional advice & counselling.   They've heard it all, have extensive experience with memory-loss issues & complications.  

Idk but, I wonder if it's sadly time for him to go residential, where professionals will be able to monitor & treat & care for him appropriately?   And your partner at the very least would be in need of therapy/counselling,  and a respite break too probably.    I feel for you!  Best of luck!",2022-05-02 03:01:29,TeelaArt,ugjs4m
Dementia,I Need to Vent,"This is the late-night/early morning ramblings of an Autistic, stressed-out, terrified mind. I (40f) live with my parents because I can't afford to move out. I have alerts set up on various property websites that let me know when a property matching my search criteria is listed, but the rent is always far too much especially with the deposit added on top (usually equal to or greater than the 1st month's rent.

My Dad is 73 this year and I'm not sure what stage of Altzheimer's he has. I think middle, cos he's always asking me if I'm working that day, even when I'm dressed in my work uniform. Sometimes he'll randomly ask me in the afternoon when I've been around all day.. 

I really can't keep going like this- constantly getting super anxious when dad gets up in the middle of the night. Always laying awake worrying about what he's doing. Where he's gonna pee. If he's gonna make a mess. 

I'm terrified of mum finding it & going apeshit, yelling at dad, slamming doors & drawers, dad saying stop shouting/slamming stuff cos it makes him confused. I just finished cleaning up after him again.

It's a good thing I was still awake tonight when Dad did what he did.

 This time he peed out the front door. I was retching as I came downstairs. I used the last of the kitchen paper, some TP, & some (Antibacterial spray cos it got all over the door frame. When I asked why he did it he claimed it was cos my mum doesn't allow him to pee anywhere else. 

I think I got it all but some may have gone under the bottom of the door frame. I worry abt the stink that may develop even with the spray. 

He'll probably get found out at that point and I'll get yelled at for covering it up. Last time this happened, he peed in the living room! And guess who cleaned that mess up as well... I asked him if he was gonna just leave the pee as is and he said no, but he had already gotten back into bed. Plus he can't really get down onto his hands and knees anymore. 

I can only pray none of our neighbours were awake and happened to look out their windows in our direction. I had to give up on numbering these cos I wasn't sure how much I needed to get off my chest. I'll definitely have to call the housing association & beg for a house/flat.

Yes, Dad has Altzheimer's, but is it wrong of me to want a calm, stress-free life? I'm sure that's what mum wants too. As an Autistic person, I hate stress, I hate the anxiety, I hate what this is doing to both my parents but esp to my mum. In my darkest thoughts (& I'm ashamed to admit this), I sometimes think it would be better had he died. Or that I had gotten out of this house years ago. 

 I also wish nursing homes were less expensive- £800 per week is in no way affordable! I'm tired. I'm tired of having to hide the messes dad makes.

I'm tired of the stress, the anxiety, the fear. I'm tired of having to mask. Of having to pretend things are perfectly fine. Of having my home invaded multiple times a day by the carers for dad. But at the same time I know they're necessary to cut down on messes, to get dad up, washed and dressed in the mornings, toileted 2x during the day then again at night & also changed for bed. 

I'm laying here in bed, still awake, with only a short nap yesterday (sunday) afternoon plus maybe an hr or so tonight. But I still can't sleep. I stg, I'm not gonna be happy if i hear dad get up again tonight. I'm so thankful i don't have to work today. But tomorrow is another story.

I had thought of renting a room from someone, but often the rent for a room is close to the price for a 1bed flat. But then again your bills might be included in that price. I definitely need a place of my own as soon as possible though. I really need to cry but I can't afford to.

Marking as NSFW just to be safe (I've never posted anything like this before).","Everything you're saying is absolutely understandable, and you're not a bad person for wanting to be in a less stressful situation. The sad reality is that this is a horrible disease and it only gets worse. There may be moments and days that are easier or better than others, but in all it's just a terribly stressful and tiring job to be in the home when caring for someone with Alzheimer's/dementia. 

A lot of children feel the responsibility to help care for their parents when this type of thing happens. Sometimes it's because of a sense of duty to their parent/guilt about trying to help them, other times it's a financial issue. Either way, you are under no obligation to stay in a situation that is causing you harm or emotional distress.

If you haven't already, you should talk to your mother about how this is affecting you. She might not be receptive, but you'll feel better being honest with her. It may work out that even while not living at home, you are able to have some time to rest and recharge and then come home for a couple of days to help each week or month. 

I would seek out any services that may be offered in your area for Alzheimer's/dementia patients. Sometimes there are day programs where you can drop off your family member, allowing you to get some time to rest. Full-time care is very expensive, but sometimes it's less expensive to have an aide living in the home 24/7 than to move someone to a care facility. 

And for your own sanity, create a realistic budget if you haven't already. There may be options to rent a room in a larger home or shared building (with common kitchen/bathroom areas). Cut back on all unnecessary spending and get that first month's rent + deposit. You need to do what's best for you. Your parents (hopefully) had you with the wish that you would lead a life that was as happy, fulfilling, and independent as possible. 

In the meantime, do your best to take care of yourself and your mom. Try to sleep as best as you can, and eat as well as you can. You're no good to anyone, least of all yourself, if you're burned out.",2022-05-02 02:56:31,Ah-non-ah-mouse,ugjp94
Dementia,My grandma has dementia and tries to wash her hands in the toilet bowl after she pees or poops. What do people with dementia see a toilet as? For example do they see a sink or a clean bucket of water or they just talk themselves into thinking its clean. Not sure if anyone would even know the answer,,"There can be a difficult recognizing objects. So it might trigger in her head that it looks like a sink because she hears water.  A bowl may seem like a hat. That is why prompting is necessary at this stage. For instance some don't recognize that the food is in front of them until told it is or helped to start eating.
If she is still able to read, you might try posting big (I mean BIG) signs by the objects you want her to use- we do that with my 89-year-old MIL when she stays at our home (like her bedroom, the bathroom, the bathroom sink with instructions to wash hands). It’s not perfect, but it does help (along with a lot of supervision).
Mine can’t figure out where she is supposed to put the toilet paper. She wanted to do laundry and put the soap in the spice rack on the back of the pantry door.

Your never going to understand how they come up with these things,
Yeh idk, sorry, that's hard.   Maybe put a clear simple picture/diagram of 'handwashing' over the basin?   Pictures can help more than signs with words.   My mum often sweeps/rakes the pavement outside her house of leaves - a few weeks I came home & found her out there with a mop.  Hmm....
Unfortunately my grandma has done this a few times too in the past. I can only guess what goes on in her head. So once she finishes going to the toilet, the next logical thing is to wash her hands. However our sink is in a separate room to the toilet and so I assume she sees the bowl and thinks, oh yes basin with water. She probably has forgotten where it is too. Nowadays she needs basically 24/7 supervision, so it's not really an occurrence anymore.
It can sometimes help to hang signs. 
I once cared for a woman who saw her walk in shower as a washing machine. Flooded the bathroom, then thought the washer was broken and tried to call for repairs. 
Hang signs above the sink, toilet and shower that simply label it and maybe a clip art type picture of each item.
I'm not sure what is up with that.  My mom would pretty much stuff the toilet with toilet paper and find something else to wipe herself with - the shower scrubbie, the shower curtain, a towel, whatever was close.  Her bathroom hygiene was horrendous.
From what I’ve seen with my grandparents this can be understandable. 

Best thing you can do is not freak out and guide them, make a sing-songy response. They can latch on to that panic and get more confused. 

Your grandmother knows that in the bathroom you pee/poo and wash your hands. 

What she might not be able to do is understand which tools to use and when, so she tries to do it all at once. 
She knows what she needs to do but not how and that is scary for her so she gets by as best she can. 

I came downstairs at 3am, my grandfather loved to clean and liked everything tidy. 

He had the whole microwave in the sink. 

He needed to clean the inside of the micro wave (he used to wipe it down daily) and the place you clean cookware is in the sink. 

Makes perfect sense! 

As for the bucket of water; The examples you give involve complex thought, remember the brain is just a wet squishy mass with some chemicals and electricity, even basic things we do are immensely complex functions. 

Your gran may just see the water and be able to connect it to “water washes”. 
Thinking about water quality and being appropriate just won’t connect in the same way.
I freaked out pretty bad when I saw my uncle doing the same thing and wondered how long he's been doing that. So now I go into the bathroom every time he does to prevent this. Its really mind blowing what our loved ones might perceive things from their point of view like my uncle the other day couldn't find the bathroom and almost urinated on the vaccum lol I gotta laugh cause there's still plenty to be sad about.

I know its gross and the disease is so ruthless like that. I wish I knew a good solution other than thoroughly clean her hands after every bathroom use or as you feel is needed. Have plenty of wetwipes and sanitizer if she doesn't want to wash her hands at the sink. I'm sorry you are dealing with this.",2022-05-01 23:52:30,moonchild-222,uggxkn
Dementia,Is it normal for a dementia patient to look like an abuse victim?,"Some background my grandmother in law had dementia, she passed January 2020. In December she had gone missing by that I mean no one in the family could contact her, she had been in my FILs custody. And he wasn’t answering his phone either. Later she was found at a hospital near his house. We sadly didn’t go to see her, a deer ran into the side of our car on the way there. But my spouses mother did and showed us pictures and she looked emaciated and had bruises bad all over but really bad on her wrists and ankle. I was wondering if this was normal or are our suspicions of elder abuse true?","Whether or not she is being abused, this is not a safe condition for your grandmother in law to be in. She is clearly not safe in her home with your FIL, either because he is incapable of caring for her and meeting her needs or because he is abusing her.

In any case, I would make the APS report and allow them to investigate. I'm assuming the hospital also made a report as they are mandated to do so.
No dementia doesn't cause bruises unless they fall.  Emaciated means she wasn't eating, bruises but really bad bruises on wrists and ankles imo sounds like she may have been restrained.
Idk, have you consulted with dementia org or elder abuse org for what the options might be, if any?",2022-05-01 17:48:39,Cbell727,ugaahe
Dementia,Feeling evil,"I feel like such a pos and I love my mom but to see her age with this disease..it is killing me. My mom is combative, everything is a fight. It is a struggle to get her to shower. She plays in her poop. I am so fucking done, I feel evil for thinking it but I wish lethal euthanasia for people was legal because whoever is occupying her body, it is not the woman I used to know.","You're not evil.  If we saw someone forcing their pet to live through what our loved ones are forced to live through we'd be disgusted and outraged.  The disease kills the personality pretty quickly but the body is forced to live on.  In effect, we're caring for zombies.  It's cruel and dehumanizing and you aren't the bad one for recognizing it.
I hear you. Weeks ago I screamed at my husband and such a level I have never screamed before, just an out of control primal scream. It was awful. I don't know how we get through this long and ugly journey.  Just hold on as best you can.
Truly understand what you are going through.  My very proper mom pooped in the waste can at the rehab facility, then pooped in her bed when first hospitalized. I had gone out for supper, came back to find her and bed covered in poop.  She was unfazed.  So embarrassed for her.  Cleaned as much as I could before a nurse came in.  When she came home with me it was diaper time until she passed away. This disease turns a civilized sweet person into an animal sometimes.
I totally get it, it's so hard. It's not evil to have caregiver burnout and want it all to end.

Watching everyone on my dad's side of the family sacrifice so much to provide compassionate care to our elderly relatives had a big impact on me as a kid. It showed me what love and family was really about and set an expectation in me that I wouldn't give up on my own relatives even when it was hard. When things are very difficult it might help to think about the positive example you're setting for younger relatives when you keep going day by day. The help you give your mom may feel like it isn't seen and doesn't matter but it does. I hope things get better for you somehow.
I'm so sorry, OP.  

We're here for you, and we understand.  We all have this struggle so we're a safe place for you to vent.    


I'll confess too.  Next time my mom is hospitalized, I'm going to push to have her put into Skilled Nursing.  I'd never do anything to harm her, and I don't want her to suffer, but I'm so fucking done wiping her ass every day, changing her wet diaper, making sure she has ointment in her skin folds to prevent fungal infections, getting her to drink water, hiding food she'll binge on and make herself sick.  All of it. And my mom doesn't even play with her poop and I'm done.
We've all been there. Being a caregiver is very difficult at the best of times and when they're fighting you every step of the way it can be brutal. So don't beat yourself up. You just have to get through one more day. Don't think about the day after that. Just one day.
My mom lives in a memory care facility, cruelly wasting away. She is so confused. I know I would be if nothing translated into memories, short or long term. I’m wondering how I can avoid ending up like this.

Hang in there, friend.
I absolutely understand where you are coming from and I very much sympathize😢. Especially the gross and rarely talked about aspects of this dehumanizing disease. You are beyond exhausted and in mourning of the person your mom used to be and nothing in this world could've prepared you for the horrors or literal shit show you deal with every day. Its ok to breakdown and you are not evil to want a peaceful way of leaving this life for your mom. Yesterday I lost my composure with my uncle while attempting to clean him and shit actual shit got way out of hand so I relate to you on the poop situation. Sending you loads of strength and ❤
I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. I can't imagine how hard it is to see a loved one in that state. I work in a memory care facility and my heart goes out to the loved ones who still come to visit. It's so hard for them, for both parties, but I imagine for the loved ones especially.

Edit to add you are not a piece of shit.
It s quite natural. 
I find myself wishing my mom s death every day. 
I ve decided to put her in a home because i was starting to become a monster and ill treated her. 

This disease is awful, it seems to affect more the care giver. 

My father is losing his mind, my brother has been deeply depressed for years. We are all burnt out. 

Anyway, if you are evil, so am i.
Completely normal feelings in the face of this evil disease. The disease is evil, not you. Please know this.
Not at all evil. My dad and I had the same thoughts when my mom got really bad. It's less wanting them to die and more wanting them to not suffer any more.
You're not evil.  It is horrible - I went through the same thing with my mom until she went into a nursing facility.  I spent a year cleaning up whatever mess she made in her apartment (yes, including in the bathroom) every other day.  It's so, so frustrating.  I will tell you one thing, though, now that she is in professional care, she has some of her dignity back.  The facility she is in is wonderful - they make sure she is clean & fed.  They do all kinds of activities with the patients.  I feel like trash that I don't go and see her, but at this point, she thinks my brother & I are small children - I don't want to disrupt her world by showing up.  I'm sure a 50-year-old woman showing up saying she's her daughter would really mess up her mind when she thinks I'm like 10-years-old.  I'm in regular communication with the facility, so I know she's OK...
My mom is still relatively independent and I already have these thoughts. You aren’t evil.
My mom just recently passed and although I miss her terribly, I am relieved she is no longer just a shell . I prayed everyday she would pass quietly . It would be wonderful if people were allowed to make their wishes about their end of life known  while they were able ,so they wouldn’t need to hang on like this. Even with assisted suicide the individual has to understand and know what is happening. Talk about a catch 22. Mom always said ,she wanted to just die , until one day she couldn’t communicate anymore.  You are not a pos you are someone who is torn by  watching a love one suffer and slowly go down hill. while you are being abused in the process.
I agree. We don't let our dogs and cats suffer but we expect our parents to. My Mom is combative too. I swear she is getting revenge on me for my teenage years!
You aren't evil. You know your mom is gone mentally and you don't want to keep suffering or see her physical being continue to suffer. I think the majority of us here completely understand and often feel the same when it gets to that point. Hugs to you.
You say out loud what many think as they watch a spouse, partner, parent, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather waste away from a terminal illness.  Dementia is particularly horrible because, though the mind/brain is gone, the body keeps chugging along.

You're a good, decent person who has to witness and endure the slow, torturous, decline and wasting away of the person you love.
Sharing makes it better. Caregiver burn out is definitely real. One day at a time. I feel your pain and am here with you. You made my day a bit better. One day at a time. It was slightly easier today because of what you shared. ODAAT.",2022-05-01 17:41:48,nippplooool,uga5j2
Dementia,Dementia with diabetes,My 84 yr. Father was put on home health care after he became unable to walk. This progressed to palliative care and then hospice care in a period of about 3 months. The hospice nurse suggests I stop his diabetes meds but I am reluctant to comply. I am having to change depends many times a day as he became bedridden. He is still fairly heavy and has some appetite. He still has some good hours occasionally and I believe he could live for longer than hospice tells me. Just wanting to hear thoughts on stopping life prolonging meds,"Kindly asking—what would be the benefit to your father of prolonging his time on hospice? My husband is also diabetic and we are treating it with multiple diabetes medicines. His sister came for a visit and was really trying to point out his horrible eating to him. When we were alone, I pointed out that food doesn’t taste good to him, but sweets do. His cognitive impairment also means he can’t understand and follow through with a healthy diet. Sure, he would avoid diabetes complications if he would eat healthy, but he is going to die either way. Allowing him to eat what he wants knowing some complication of diabetes (heart attack for instance since he had a heart attack 6 years ago) could be the cause of death instead of dementia could actually be a mercy for him.
You may want to ask what a death caused by diabetes actually looks like. How long does it take, how painful, how sudden is it? What does his quality of life look like until then?

Compare that to death caused by dementia at the very bitter end. Which is, basically one of a few possibilities: becoming unable to swallow and either choking suddenly or refusing food, or eating and some food goes into his lung where it caused micro damage and gets infected and becomes septic.

Feeling decently good until suddenly having a stroke or heart attack may be preferable to stretching it out to the bitter end, where basically nothing brings him comfort.
Hospice doesn't take this type of stuff lightly. If they have made that recommendation it may unfortunately be your best course of action. My mom is diabetic and has dementia as well. I think about stuff like this an awful lot. I truly feel for you.
If hospice told me to withdraw all of my husband's medications I would do so.  I would never allow my husband to survive one moment longer than necessary.
Talk to your father's physician and ask what is the kindest outcome.
I recall when my mom was in a nursing facility, with Alzheimer’s dementia and on hospice, she was taken to a dentist by my sister for a painful & infected tooth. There was a lot of disagreement on whether to treat the infection with antibiotics and in the process extend her life. Some family members felt it cruel to withhold the meds., others thought hospice enrollment suggested otherwise. 

In the end she was given the antibiotics.
Thank you so much for all the great feedback. I will talk to his PCP and reconsider.
Virtual hugs.  Type 1 or type 2 diabetes?  What medications are taken how frequently for the diabetes?  How often is his blood sugar checked?  What's a low look like? A high?  An average reading?  Also, did the hospice nurse go over how to tell if his blood sugar is low or high?
It's easy really...Would YOU want to live like that? I know I wouldn't! Death would be a merciful escape.",2022-05-01 13:42:51,AggressiveActivity2,ug547k
Dementia,I am terrified about my mom getting dementia.,"My mom (62) can sometimes be forgetful, but she is normally on track of her appointments and work at her job. She is sometimes absent minded, asking me if I ate food after eating next to her, but then again she is consumed by Facebook and WhatsApp on your iPhone. She also plays a ton of word games and memory matching games. On top of that, my mom works in the school district so she always manages to stay on track of her work. She LOVES to talk so she will often repeat stories after telling us earlier in the day and sometimes she does not realize she has told us before. 

She is obese, but has been treating her high blood pressure and high cholesterol from years so everything is in normal range according to her blood tests. We are working on getting her to lose weight through diet changes and she has cut down a lot on her calories, but it is hard for her to exercise since her knees hurt a lot. I am starting to look at chair/sitting down exercises and it does look promising for losing weight. 

For all intents and purposes she is fine, but I just have this terrible fear that she will suffer from dementia in the future.

Any help on how to cope with this?","I suspect you’re jumping the gun on the dementia fears. It sounds to me like she’s just a very busy person whose mind is in 21 places at once. Once people hit their late 50s to early 60s, the memory tends to fade a bit. She might have undiagnosed ADHD.
If she’s willing to see a neurologist to get a baseline, or do some cognitive testing, that’s a good starting point. If she’s managing her health, she should continue to do so under a 
doctor’s supervision. All of these things, along with making sure she’s managing her stress and getting good sleep is the best one can do to maintain their overall health. 
It’s good to be vigilant, but I wouldn’t worry too much unless the doctor’s start seeing something, or you begin to notice any major personality changes. And don’t forget to take care of yourself throughout any of this. Added stress and lack of sleep won’t do you any good.
I feel the same about my dad(60). His mother (my grandma) already has dementia, which has sparked the conversation of ""what would happen if he ever got diagnosed?"" a few times.
He does not take care of his health - mental or physical - at all, and according to himself he hasn't even seen a doctor in over 30 years. No matter what me or my partner say, he won't even go for a quick check up. I do worry about him a lot.
Fears about the future are definitely hard to deal with, but I think it's necessary to come to terms with them one way or another. Best of luck to you.
Likely need to address her being obese versus her memory. At least start with the neurologist for testing.",2022-05-01 12:19:03,hshsydud,ug3cfz
Dementia,"How do I make my grandmother with dementia understand that it is night-time, and not day-time?","Title. She’s adamant that it is day-time, and is not going to sleep. Please help.","You can’t “make” her understand. The part of her brain that processes that is broken. At some point she will fall asleep, but instead of arguing with her I suggest seeing if you can get her to have a sleepy time tea, maybe cozy up in bed, read to her, etc. Ensure she is exposed to morning sunlight to help support her circadian rhythms as much as possible. Good luck.
Before anyone else on this sub suggests melatonin or an OTC sleeping pill I will advise you against this. These can problematic in combination with other medications, can worsen her state and increase her risk for falls. I felt I should comment in this regard given how many times I see these suggested. If a consistently altered sleep pattern is an ongoing concern be sure to address this with her physician. They may be able to suggest something more appropriate treatment wise or at least suggest guidelines for monitoring the effects of medications such as melatonin.
Also, I started caregiving at 23. I felt too young at that age. You are def too young for it now. Your grandmother should qualify for some benefits that may help someone come in the home to provide care for a few hours, while you get some respite. Please consider contact your local Agency on Aging. And your uncle is not your responsibility either. You deserve a full life.
There are clocks you can buy that say the date, day of the week, time, and part of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night). 

Parenting my MIL with dementia is A LOT like parenting my toddlers. You could look into communicating bedtime with toddlers for ideas. You could look up GloClock, which moms swear by.
Maybe some smart lamps programed to dim at night time and turn back on in the morning could help? I'm autistic and I do that for myself and use Philips Hue lamps in my living room to signal bedtime and in my bedroom as a ""sunrise"" to help me with daily rhythms.
Essentially you got to get her back on a sleep schedule.. like a child. Stay in routine. Tv off, lights dimmed, pjs on, lights out. As another has mentioned, morning sunlight helps. 

Mine just now sleeps in till 10 or 11.. soo making sure she gets up at a decent time is my battle.
Medication. Get something that will call her down and put her to sleep in the evenings. Xanax helps calm my grandma. She tries to leave the home and visit friends at 1 a.m. I use to lay in bed with her and hold her down for hours as she screamed and cried about not being able to leave. I wasn’t getting any sleep for MONTHS till she got prescribed Xanax. Life changing. I now get a full nights rest and so does she.
You are not likey to be successful at it, and sometimes the more you try the more they disagree.

My dad had dementia and before he got to the worst of it, he told me that you start life as a baby and then you go back to being one. He was right, there came a point where we would bathe him and change his diaper.

Your not dealing with the same grand mom you remember, it's not that she is being mean it's that she no longer know what's going on.
I can't begin to imagine taking care of a loved one at 17 its too much responsibility to burden and I'm sorry you are struggling. Caregiving is hard at any age and you pretty much sacrifice your life to do this full time. You are very wonderful to care for your grandma ❤

Maybe if she can be seen by a doctor who can prescribe some type of medication or perhaps add some melatonin before bed and definitely get some day time exposure like if she can be taken for a walk. I hope something works.
Routine. Create a music playlist solely for getting up and starting her day and one specifically for falling asleep. Aromatherapy such as lavender at night in the bedroom has also helped my MIL.
Hi Longjumping!  Gosh you have a hard time, full respect to you!  Reading yr comments here, after seeing 'the care facilities where you live' (& cos most redditors are American) I just had a little sneak look at yr profile - wow, I used to live in your country, part time for most or all of every year, from 2000 to 2015.  Rajasthan / Himachal / sometimes Goa in season to sell my jewellery at flea markets to foreign tourists lol but I'm not too keen on Goa.   I'm Aussie.  I wonder, where are you?  

My mum got dementia diagnosis in 2009, so from then I started to spend more time home with her, maybe 4 - 6 month of the year.  We don't have other family nearby, my elder sister who has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and is sociopathic lives with her.   So yeh, I get it, about your uncle.  So sorry, it's really tough eh.   You are a champion!   Because of my mum's condition getting worse, and my sisters bad behaviour, I'm here at home full time since about 2018.  

I very strongly recommend you look at the [https://www.dementia.org.au](https://www.dementia.org.au) site.  Also other dementia orgs for UK, USA, whatever.  They have tons of information, behaviour management tips & techniques, fact-sheets, helpline webchat (I hope it's not blocked for non-Australian servers, I don't know if that might be the case) they also have email support, surely that would not be blocked for overseas people?  

I googled if there is dementia / alzheimers org India, I found this -[https://www.alz.org/in/dementia-alzheimers-en.asp](https://www.alz.org/in/dementia-alzheimers-en.asp). I don't know if you can find help there too.   

And gosh you are studying hard!  Good on you, go for gold!  I'm cheering for you!  

And, for your narc uncle - well, there is a reddit sub for narc abuse - it's actually for intimate partner abuse, like wife/husband/gf/bf, but it has great resources & information about how to live with / deal with narcs in most productive & least abuse-suffering ways.  Don't get too involved reading the posts!   On r/NarcissisticAbuse \- down the right side of the page is listed < resources > and < reading materials > .   There are many tips & tactics & techniques regarding their behaviour, and how we can (try) deal with it.   They suck.  I'm glad yr uncle is at least sometimes sweet & calm, that's good.    But the narc rages, waaa so sorry, I really feel for you!  

So, give an update sometime, or even send me a private msg.  I was sad but also had to just laugh, in India some years ago when i noticed people stopped calling me 'aunty' and started calling me 'mataji' hahhahahah lol .   Omg am i that old already, I don't think so, but I could be a part-time reddit aunty for you!  :)
As others have said, you can't make her understand, because her brain isn't capable of processing that info anymore. What you can do is TRY to establish a bedtime routine and make sure all the right ""it's night-time"" signals are there, so turn off all the lights after a certain time, pull the blinds/shutters, have a big dementia clock saying it's PM, etc. Then try to keep her as active as possible during the day and make sure she gets some sunlight. Basically, try to manage her environment and habits so she keeps getting all the right cues to tell her what time it is, and try to keep her from napping all day so she's fresh as a daisy right when you want her to go to bed. This may or may not work depending on what part of her brain is broken and whether she even responds to environmental cues anymore, but it's worth a shot.
We opened all the windows and cut on all the lights during the day. We had a schedule. She ate dinner, did something calming with quiet music, watched a soothing show and had a snack. We closed the blinds and turned off lights along the way. She took her meds and Dr prescribed melatonin (small dose) to help her settle. We also lowered the temperature a degree or two prior to bed. It worked very well for us most of the time.
You don’t. You just put her in bed, turn on the tv, and close the door.",2022-05-01 12:04:25,Longjumping-Ad-8096,ug319l
Dementia,Just got home to full blown dementia after covid kept me away,"Just got home after 3 years (stuck away from pandemic) and my step mom fully has dementia, she can't remember any new information and is usually very confused all day. The worst is she's paranoid and CONSTANTLY acuses me of taking her money/ car. Tonight she was convinced I hid her car from her. I can't reason with her and I also can't reason with my dad that she needs to see a doctor. It severe denial, and im scared something bad is going to happen, she already fell about a month ago, tripping over the dogs food bowl which has been there for literally YEARS. she's also still driving. I have literally no clue how I am supposed to deal with this, can she be forced to see a doctor????? Idk wat to do. My dad says he knows its dementia but that because her mom had it as well that we don't need a doctor because we already know what it is????

&#x200B;

is it true that you don't have to see a doctor with dementia?  my dad says there's no harm, and no meds or anything helps?","Her “freedom” could kill someone.  Put it to your dad this way: is he willing to fork out big money for lawsuits and lawyers if your stepmom hits a pedestrian, cyclist or another car driver?
There are meds that ""help"" but it's not a curable condition. They mostly help stabilize a patient's mood and give them better days... as they decline.

There's not much you can do legally without your dad's cooperation, but there are resources available only with a diagnosis (at least of mild cognitive impairment). Just try to push him to get her seen; maybe keep a journal of every time you notice impairment. If your dad's seen the gradual decline, he might not realize how bad it is to fresh eyes. 

Do you have other living options? As shitty as it sounds, if they've been getting along without you for 3 years and they're in complete denial, don't derail your life to try to get theirs on track. Stay in contact with your dad and persistently insist on connecting with a geriatric psychiatrist or some other specialist. But unless he wants to force your mom to go, there's not a ton you can do.

If she's actively a danger to herself (which, IMO, her driving is) you should contact Adult Protective Services to see if they can offer any help or advice. The driving is a big issue, as I think you realize - take her keys and hide them because her driving at all is a huge menace to everyone.
I'm so sorry. I would suggest contacting an elder abuse/neglect hotline in your state. She is at the point where she needs a legal guardian or caretaker and if your dad won't take her dementia seriously the state will step in.
Tell him that confusion is also a sign of a bladder infection, and she needs to see the Doctor to make sure that isn't a problem...then make an appointment.
As for a drivers license.  I just didn't take my dad to get his renewed.
The driving one is difficult. We drove my dad everywhere to stop him driving without him noticing and when his license renewal came through, I ticked that he had dementia which led to a license suspension pending a medical which, of course, he failed. We were very lucky his license was up for renewal because it was getting difficult. You need to act on that if nobody else is. If your dad doesn’t want to acknowledge it you need to get adult social services/driving licensensing agency/police involved because it will only end badly.
I am sorry for your journey. It's hard. I agree that taking the keys is mandatory. Her rights are informed by responsibility.  Regarding doctors. Meds are supposed to prevent further deteriorating. However, I did not see any change with my mom's condition. It's hard to compare, though, to something that did not happen. I took mom to the neurologist and neuropsychologist to help address the driving issue. Both said she shouldn't drive to her but did nothing to really stop her so I ended up disabling the car. I unhooked the battery first. Then got a steering wheel lock. All this talk of getting elder care involved is a slippery slope. I think you need some support to help with planning and preparing. This is a family disease.
Not sure where you are but there should be some kind of vulnerable adult agency if you are in the USA to contact.  If you can't fine one, perhaps a call to the police.  Sounds like neither of them are making good decisions.  Also, time to make sure you have power of attorney and there are medical documents in place as well.  You need to do this for THEM as well as for yourself.
Just take her keys, take all copies, put them somewhere your father and step mother cannot access them. She could literally kill someone, it's not time to worry about feelings or politeness.
contact adult protective services. 
this is an accident waiting to happen
I went through a nearly identical scenario. Finally put my mom in Asst living because her accusations escalated to knife and scissors. There is no cure but doc prescribed medicine to calm her hallucinations or psychotic episodes. Once she moved out, she stopped accusing me and started accusing the employees there (but they are familiar and more equipped to deal with it), and now I’m the good guy again.
As others have said. There are things that will help with quality of life. I couldn't fathom dealing with dementia without psych and neurology.
Holy shit you need an official diagnosis now. 

This reminds me of The Office where Steve carrels character yells “BANKRUPTCY” and believes he has declared bankruptcy because he said the words. 

Just because he knows it’s dementia does nothing to help her and gives him very little power to get her the help she needs. Please push this and get any family support you have. This will destroy your father doing it alone, don’t let that happen.",2022-05-01 07:32:08,NoHoliday1277,ufxz2x
Dementia,What do I do with my suspicions of dementia in a parent?,"My mom is nearly 70. 

Earlier this year, my mom was doing something weird.  Basically more often than not she was in a silent mood to me.  I live at home and I am mindful of my own attitude and mood.  I am not critical or sarcastic.  I am always helping with jobs and paying bills.  I can't think of a reason for the silence.  It wasn't the first time.  The silence was on and off for months. One morning she might not be talk to me and than the next she could be trying to be my best friend.  The evenings as well.  Some evenings after work, she's sitting in her chair and I would be lucky if I got 'hello' out of her.   Any attempt at conversation from me was met with one word replies.  Then there would be days she would be in the silence mode and she would start prancing around the house and get her jacket and looked as if she was making progress to go out and then the next second I would hear the front door close.  Not even a 'goodbye' from her.  No speech to tell me where she's going.  If she's going for a walk or to the shops. 


This was the behaviour that caught me off guard.  I thought it was so weird.   

I was able to think back over the past 2 years and there were some other behaviours too and it's only now that I am piecing things together and thinking maybe dementia might be setting in. 

My understanding of dementia though is that there is a forgetfulness or confusion.  I will admit, there is some mixing up of things from her but it's ever so mild and I can be the same when I am busy and stressed.   

A relatively new behaviour from her is OCD cleaning.  The youngest is gone now from the nest and she had a lot of focus on him and helping him.  She's now cleaning every day and a lot of it I think is OCD cleaning.  

This is difficult for me because my suspicions of dementia is not showing up as forgetfulness.  It's just some odd stuff on mood and angers and ocd stuff. 

Every day is different with her.  Some days are ok and then other days she's just flat if that makes any sense. 

I don't know how to go forward with my suspicions.   I feel like I can't talk to her about this. She's not going to welcome any of this and it will likely result in an outburst from her. 
I don't feel comfortable ringing or writing or emailing to the GP practice. 
I would feel more comfortable talking to a GP face to face.  We attend to the same practice.  I wonder would it be ok for me to make an appointment for myself at some point and raise concerns about my mom so they can maybe not it on her chart and start the process of investigating. 

I think there's definitely something going on but it's not showing up as a typical forgetfulness. I know some replies to me before said sometimes UTIs can present in a similar way.  I don't know if it is a UTI because I can go back 2/3 years with pieces of my mom's behaviours.  If it was an undiagnosed UTI surely she would be in sepsis by now.","I was about to ask the same question. My mother-in-law has been displaying memory issues for a while but it's been progressing quickly in the past few months. Now she has started being suspicious and accusing people of taking advantage of her memory issues by lying to her about things she has forgotten, such as looking after her grandchildren on a specific date. (Told to her by 2 people multiple times over a period of months). 

We really want her to see a doctor but she keeps either kicking the can down the road or saying she doesn't want to talk about it.
It's usually very difficult to get family member to cooperate if approached with a 'we think you might have dementia-issues so you need to go see doctor'.    But -

Absolutely you can speak with your doctor regarding your concerns about her behaviour - that, they can discuss with you.  Of course patient confidentiality means her/any doctor cannot discuss with you anything from her files or anything regarding any visit they've had, but seeing the doctor is usually first stop for family members.  Often (at least down here in Aust) doctor will cooperate in at least trying to call the said family member in for 'a general check-up' or 'over-65's check-up' or whatever some such.

You can also contact your area dementia org for advice.  Best of luck!
For all anyone know it could be a stroke or a brain tumor. She needs to go to the doctors asap.
It could be a form of delerium instead of dementia. There are many causes and they're at least treatable if not mostly curable. Dementia isn't curable. It doesn't sound like dementia to me, but I have no medical degree, just a lifetime of experience living around it. If you can, get her to see a doctor. 

Honestly, in my opinion, it sounds more like she's got a secret. She's keeping quiet more with no provocation and leaving without saying anything. To me it sounds like she doesn't want company going where she's going to see what she's doing.
A change in personality is often a first sign, OP.  Try to arrange a drs visit. Anyone who specializes or has worked with the elderly is great. A psychiatrist is great, too, esp if they have worked with the elderly. Call around. Ask questions. Since this isn't an emergency yet, you have a chance to get in with a good dr at the beginning of this. Trust me, if it's cognitive decline or worse, that will make all the difference. Best of luck",2022-05-01 06:48:38,summerrosegarden,ufxbyf
Dementia,how can I help my great grandma who lives halfway across the country?,"I'm almost 24 now, she's 84. My great grandma is Saint of a woman who helped raise me and so many others in the family. I call her a few times a month to twice a week, mail her pictures, and occasionally get her stuff from Amazon to help her out (walking shoes, pajamas, etc), and visit every few years when I can afford to. 

I've noticed her condition getting significantly worse and I'm wondering what more I can do to help her? She has her sons and grandsons helping her out since she and my great grandpa aren't able to drive. It breaks my heart listening to her confusion - she thinks it's currently December, and told me that two of her daughters recently passed away (even though they passed 10 and ~15 years ago). I don't know what to do or how to deal with this, any advice is greatly appreciated.","don’t correct her. Go with the flow of whatever she believes. “*Oh gee Grandma, is it really December already? Wow, time flies. What do you want for Christmas? Any plans to make it special?*” heck send her Christmas-themed cinnamon and sugar vanilla hand cream, chocolate oranges, fuzzy socks with grips on the bottom, adult coloring books.

you’re doing great. 

when it comes to visits, frequent short visits makes more of an impact than long ones. I assume this works for phone calls too. Even a few minutes every couple days is better than 1 hour weekly. If she’s still mentally cognizant of you, you want to schedule your visits sooner rather than later. sadly that won’t last forever, don’t take it for granted. If you can set up flight alerts so you bet notified when ticket prices drop o consider skiplagged, that can cut down on cost.",2022-05-01 01:31:59,imjustdesi,ufsyaa
Dementia,Falling a lot in mid-stage dementia. Time for a home?,"My mother in law is probably at stage 6- can’t be left alone for more than a few hours, doesn’t drive or cook, doesn’t remember to get dressed or bathe on her own and pees herself a lot. My partner is her primary caregiver and has been living with her and taking care of her ADLs for over a year. It is taking a huge toll on them mentally as they have no time for friends, hobbies, pets, a job or me. We recently hired weekend caregivers to check on her so partner can come home and spend time with me. 

Well, first weekend alone and the caregiver arrived to find her on the floor. She doesn’t remember when or how she fell. This happens every few months, always when she’s left alone. I think it’s possibly related to her anxiety about being left. She wants my partner to be by her side 24/7 and is not capable of understanding why that isn’t possible. She gets upset when they leave. 

MIL is still conversational and wants a lot of company all day and night. She can read but gets frustrated with most activities and mostly wants to watch tv. Her ability to take walks changes every day. She is still aware of who we are and where she is, but doesn’t know what day or season it is and does not retain information/conversations. Our plan was to build an addition on our house, move her here and have caregivers assist us with her ADLs and keep her company. I work from home full time so I could help a little but burnt out partner would still be primary caregiver. It’s going to take a good 4-6 months to get the addition built and she seems to be declining already. Moving her in without the addition would be even more stressful on all of us (too small, shared bathroom etc).

My partner feels a lot of pressure to make this happen for her because she wants so badly to be with us. But we are realizing she might be at a point where she needs 24/7 care. I will not allow my poor partner to further deteriorate by sleeping with her and accompanying her for every single bathroom trip. She does have money for a care facility and we’re in the middle of putting her assets in trust in case she lives longer than 5 years. 

I guess what I’m asking is, what would you do? I am protective of my partner and cannot bear to watch them fall into a black hole of depression over this and lose more of their precious life to her constant care. Is it time to put her in a home?

Editing to add: my partner is very upset, and has been on the verge of a nervous breakdown for months. We were really hoping these weekends off would be a decent compromise until MIL is moved in with us but it already doesn't seem to be working. I am very concerned.","It’s definitely time to start looking into memory care. Usually by the time people start wondering about it, it’s already overdue. 

At the very least overnight/live-in aides, not just daytime. This may be a good option if she still knows she is in her own house, since that is a source of comfort she may not have later on. If she were already saying “I wanna go home” then it wouldn’t matter

Is she aware enough to push a button if she falls?",2022-04-30 12:55:05,go_ask_freya,uff4k1
Dementia,How tf do I cope with this.,"Edit: Thank you all so much for your incredibly kind words. I will go through each and every comment later! 💛 I'm overwhelmed, this community is amazing.

First of all, I'm glad this sub exists. The fact that we all basically share similar experiences makes me feel less alone. 

So, I'm only 21 (about to turn 22) and my dad (in his late 70s) has had dementia for a long time, I'd say it started around 2015. Last year he moved into a care facility, which is relieving on one hand, but on the other hand his dementia has progressed extremely fast in this past year. He doesn't recognize any of his family anymore, he needs to be fed and help on the toilet.
He recently was in the hospital cause of kidney failure and since then it got even worse. He barely wakes up anymore and if he does, he is not present. Just a body without a soul. 
Basically I'm starting to prepare myself for his passing. My coping strategy so far has been surpressing everything. It's just too painful to let it get to me. I love my dad over everything, he means the world to me.

So... how tf can I survive losing my dad this young? How do you even cope with that? How do you overcome losing the person you love the most?","You cope the best way you can. I'm glad you came to this sub to tell your story that many are dealing with but few talk about. I too am glad to have found this subreddit cause I've learned so much and it allows me to relate to other people both older and younger who are struggling getting through this Hell. This disease is so cruel in how it steals our loved ones from us. Its absolutely traumatizing for sure. My heart goes out to you and your dad❤
I struggled with my Dad and his advanced dementia for a long time.  He never went to any facility.  He lived in my home and I was his primary caretaker.  The last year of his life he was in hospice care.  What was the main benefit?  They helped me keep him clean.  Dad was able to get in the shower until he started falling (collapsing) on the way to the bathroom.  The hospice insisted he stay in bed.  Changing diapers and getting him to roll over was always a challenge.  Dad would not open his legs to get the diaper off.  The last week was brutal.  The hospice did nothing to remove a softball sized blockage in his intestine.  They killed him.  Dad passed away February 18 and I’ve been struggling ever since.  I’m praying your Dad does not suffer at the end.
The grief you feel is the price you have to pay for losing a loved one. There is a time you have to permit bad feelings to happen.
I'm so sorry. Losing a parent is never ever easy, no matter what age. I lost my mom when I was in my 30's, and now my dad is in a very similar situation to yours. I don't know which is worse, losing a parent suddenly like my  mom, or a long protracted one with my dad. Either way it's wrenching.

You do survive, though. It's tough, but you do. We have no choice, we keep going forward. We get used to the pain, the sharp edge does eventually disappear, and it just becomes a part of your new reality. You miss them, you think of them, but the time will come when those thoughts won't ruin your day entirely. Doesn't mean you stopped loving them or that you're done grieving. 

Don't suppress. Let it out. Get grief counseling, I know it helped me. Talk about him. Look at his pictures. Remember the good times. Keep him alive in your soul, protect his legacy in your heart. Tell him you love him as much as you can while you still can, maybe somewhere deep down he will hear you. I know that's what I do, even though my dad also no longer seems to remember me very much. 

Huge hugs to you.
It's hard, especially when you're young. We were in our 20s when my MIL was diagnosed. Surpressing everything sounds pretty draining to me though. I hope you're able to process everything one day when you're ready.
Go with your feelings,.
I am sorry this is happening to you at your young age. I lost my Dad too soon and I miss him everyday.

How I survived was that my body only let me process my grief in stages, almost a shock that really kept me alive when I thought the grief would kill me. 

It didn’t and I am five years out now. I still miss him but the crushing grief feels further away. 
I have movies that help me cry when I know I need to or I listen to music. 
Some days I still cry but the amazing thing is that he still feels like he is with me.
I think of him everyday and talk to him in my mind.
I have heard his voice very clear in my mind also at certain times when I really needed him.
I am not a religious person but the feeling of him always with me now is a comfort I wouldn’t have expected.
When we really love someone, their love never really leaves us. They are part of us and we remain connected. 
Maybe I will see my dad again someday in another time or place and that gives me comfort.
My Dad was sick for a long time and I know have relief that his suffering is over but it took me a long time to get there. 
Be so patient with yourself and accept however you feel as ok.
I am also a parent and I have no doubt that your Dads love for you is forever and that he would want you to take the best care of yourself that you can during this hard time.
People here understand the grief and pain of dementia so I hope you post here when you need support. 
Wishing you peace and comfort.
I’m still suppressing it and he passed in January. I regret not spending more time with him and I even miss the shell he became. There were glimpses of him and he was still in there somewhere. I wish I had been brave enough to give him all the time I possibly could have but I was also selling my house and going through a bitter divorce. It wasn’t worth missing out on his last few weeks. I wish I had better advice on coping but I can say I know how hard it is. I’m so sorry you and your family are going through this especially when you are still so young.
Hi there. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I’m 27, my brother is 25 and my sister is 20. My dad has early onset Alzheimer’s and we’re putting him into long term care this summer because it’s getting harder to care for him. The illness is so cruel. But knowing that you’re not alone helps. I find this subreddit comforting because people here understand my life and struggles compared to all the people in my life. I spoke to counsellors at the Alzheimer’s society. They listen and are so kind. I also find comfort in knowing that my dad is being cleaned of all his sins because of what he’s going through. God has a plan and will take him to heaven because of this. I know it’s so hard but we’re on this earth for a short period of time. Everyone has their struggles and unfortunately ours is a bit more than others. You are so strong and have made it so far despite everything going on. You will be fine and you are strong and resilient and will come out of this stronger. Have faith in yourself and remember your dad loves you so so much.
Is there a center for aging in your area?  They may have some literature to help or a group that meets periodically. I am just now starting to deal with this myself ( Dad, 84 and Mom, 80 ) and I have plans to stop by the Center this coming week because I already know I need some help and my brother is not going to help at all.  There are resources out there.  Is there a social worker at the care facility?  The director of nurses might be able to point you in the right direction. Did your father attend church and know a minister?  Do you have aunts and uncles?  Keep looking for someone to talk to.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Therapy my friend. Honestly the answer is therapy. The earlier you go the more time you have to process and maybe be able to appreciate your dad while he’s physically still here. It can change everything.
I lost my mom to cancer when I was your age, and it was so hard. Not only during the time of her illness, but for a long time after, having to go through the ups and downs of life without the person who would normally be your guide and your confidante. I highly recommend therapy, and also trying to develop your spiritual side, whatever your beliefs, as it helps to feel more connection to people who are gone.

Also, don't put pressure on yourself to ""get over it."" It sucks to lose a parent so young. It's not fair. You have a right to be angry and sad and to feel all your emotions.",2022-04-30 07:40:00,21mia,uf9cey
Dementia,Seeking support,"My (25) mom (63) was diagnosed with dementia a few months back. It was hard to process. It feels like so much loss. Losing my mom, who she really is. Loss of what I expected. Loss might not be the right word, but different than what I hoped for. Especially for when I have kids. On top of that she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer this week. It’s not looking good. If she goes through chemo the chances of it making her dementia worse temporarily or permanently is pretty much inevitable. I guess I’m just looking for some words of encouragement/support.","It is loss. You had imagined a future with her in it. You are grieving. Arguably the grief and loss are worse because you can’t start seriously, planning your life without her. Some version of her will be stuck around, straggling and making matters complicated. And even worse, her new brain pollutes your relationships and memories of her. you deserve to call it the serious loss that it is which you are suffering.

I would definitely talk to her neurologist and get the pros and cons of fighting the breast cancer with chemo vs palliative care. From what I hear chemo is hell more so then the cancer, even if your brain is healthy. People with dementia suffer permanent long term damage from anesthesia for relatively minor surgeries. You may want to ask for a referral to a palliative care specialist about her prognosis under several circumstances so you can choose the path that is the best.
So very sorry you’re having to go through this.   And you’re both so young.   I spent a lot of time meditating and listening to uplifting podcasts when my mom was sick.   Take care of your self and try to be completely present with her in the process which is easier said than done.    Sending you virtual hugs 💕
I’m so sorry for the situation you find yourself in. Be careful to not start the grieving process to soon though, it is easy to get wrapped up in. Try and make lists of her favourite things, songs, animals, trips she’s been on.

Start a day journal about conversations you have, funny stories, weird/quirky stuff she does and says in these her later years. 

Good luck. We’re here for you.  

She’s lucky to have someone with her as she walks this and it’s always better the earlier dementia is caught, I hope you have some meaningful wonderful times with her
At this moment, I understand you would be going through a lot. You need more support as a caregiver to look after your mom. I am totally in such a position, as it becomes really hard to accept when everything comes together. 

Few things in life is not in our hands and neither we can control it. So it's better to manage things well in best possible you can do.. And till you can do.",2022-04-30 00:16:21,Pigsinablanket888,uf3dk8
Dementia,36 year old child of an elderly dementia parent,Hi I’m 36 years old and my father has dementia he’s 87 years old he’s currently in a nursing home so he’s getting great care but it’s  super hard cause he’s changed and not who he used to be he’s currently battling his 3rd UTI this year he is dehydrated and can’t comprehend how important it is to drink liquids he doesn't understand things anymore I’m losing my dad piece by piece I feel somewhat alone in this because usually this happens when the children are much older not in their 30’s (me and my sister) and our friends parents are way younger than ours I feel so lost and scared thanks for listening,"I'm so sorry for what you are experiencing. You did well to reach out, and to be following these threads.  There are a lot of good ideas, shared experiences, and sanity to be found in them.  Watching your parents age definitely sucks.  We've all got to experience it at some point in time. There is never a good time for it.  Just take relief that once it's over, it's over, and you don't have to experience it again.  Keep the good memories of when your father was a healthier version of himself, and relish that time together.
I was 32 when my mum became symptomatic, I'm 39 now. The hardest decade of my life. I feel like I missed a lot that was supposed to happen. 

Your feelings are normal, and you're not alone. I strongly recommend counselling if you can swing it. Also check out the Alzheimer's association website for support groups in your area. Feel free to message me directly if it might help to talk.
I’m so sorry that you have to go through this at such a young age. I’m glad he is being cared for in a nursing home. It is literally losing a loved one piece by piece. I am currently taking care of my dad at home and it is one of the most difficult things I have ever dealt with and I lost my mother to breast cancer when I was 23. I am now 45 and the stress and anxiety of waiting for “what next” is almost debilitating. The first time I realized that he didn’t know who I was I couldn’t stop crying. Know that you are not alone. Talk to a therapist if needed. Take advantage of any resources you have for your father and for yourself. And just visit him and love him and know that he does love you!!! I read that they may not remember who came to visit them but they will remember the warm and joyful feeling you left them with! Best of luck to you.
I’m 36 too and my mom was diagnosed six months ago at age 66, so a bit younger than your dad. It’s so difficult at this age—I thought I had so much more time left. My anxiety is now crippling waiting for the next thing—as another poster commented. I try to find the silver linings where possible but I think sometimes I do better when I admit to myself that there are none: I just try to enjoy the time I have with her, my kids, and try not to stress. Much easier said than done.

I tried a support group but I found it terribly depressing. Everyone was much older than me which made me feel worse. Hang in there, OP.
Truely is a shit time of your life, he is in care and that's the best thing for him. My sister and I went through this the last 4 years 27-31. Was extremely difficult balancing some of the most important years of your own life and making time for them.
Just remember that if they were able too they would tell them to live your life as they have already lived theirs.
Visit, love them, be patient and pray the decline is quick so they don't suffer for too long ❤️

Dementia,How to give meds when obstinate?,"My mother-in-law sometimes gets very anxious and obstinate when we try to give her the meds that will help reduce the episode.  Like a catch 22.

Sometimes she spits out the applesauce or pudding that has the crushed med in it.  I almost wish Seroquel came in an injectable for those times..not even sure if that is an option.  Anyway, do you guys have any solid tricks to get an angry loved one to take the med that will help?","OMG, we had an old cat that wouldn't eat and the vet gave me a gel to rub in his ears once a day.  Insisted I wear gloves when administering because it would make me hungry too.  Wish I could remember what the med was.  Oh well, probably not ethical to give to our loved-older-ones when they pull this. Sorry.  I'll just let myself out now.......
I usually have the best luck when seroquel is crushed and mixed with strawberry jam. Sometimes I place the mixture between two soft cookies (""Here's a jam cookie!"") or else spread on toast.
Take a syringe, put the pill inside, fill up with some water, cover the tip with your finger, and pull the plunger down forcefully so that it shoots back up a bit (without removing it completely) a few times, it dissolves the pill. Though I would check with her doctor first to make sure there isn’t an issue with dissolving for administering it.
There is a liquid form that may work better for you.  Ask your pharmacist.
Hmm..we've had luck reserving my MILs favorite drink, (grape juice) solely for taking meds and then to finish after the meds are complete. We've also taken to only taking them while standing so as to be able keep her head tilted back. I'll think on this. Good luck to you
We had this problem A LOT. My dad would either be agitated about something else or in the middle of an episode where he suspected us of poisoning him. We also tried hiding crushed meds, but the problem was that once he was in that state, he wouldn't eat anything we tried to give him.

However, he had an insatiable sweet tooth and would eat random brownies that happened to be lying about. These brownies had been made with CBD oil. As long as he didn't connect them to us, he'd eat them, and then he'd calm down, and we could try meds or crushed meds again later.

I sympathize. I know that catch 22 well - the very meds that will reduce their paranoia will also trigger it, so you can't get them to take the thing that will get them to behave more rationally. Some days my dad just didn't get his meds because pushing would trigger violent episodes, and nothing else worked. Other days, we had to drop it initially, but either CBD brownies or waiting until his mood had changed would do the trick.
Mostly my uncle will take his meds but when he doesn't I use cherry pie filling. The cherries are pitted which is great because I can slip the pills in the cherries to hide them. He doesn't wear his dentures and the pie filling is soft enough for him to swallow without chewing. It is a sticky mess to do this method but worth a shot. Sometimes I serve the cherrie pie filling over a bit of ice cream. I hope something works for you and best of luck❤
Yesterday I threatened my mother with institutionalization and life in a wheelchair. And if worked. It’s not my nature to be threatening and mean, but it often works with her. Maybe because it is her nature to be that way. I’d much rather have a gentle, loving relationship with her, but she only relates to me as The Antagonist.
This sounds really frustrating!  So I looked stuff up--seroquel doesn't come in a patch, but it looks like you can get it in gel/cream form and in liquid form (you might have to go to a compounding pharmacy instead of a regular pharmacy to get it in these forms).  Some other anti-psychotics do come in patch form.

Talk to her doctor and/or pharmacist before you crush the pills and stick them in food. Some meds have a coating that slowly dissolves over the 12 or 24 hour period.  If you crush and those kinds of meds, then the medication gets released all at once and doesn't work right--she could be overdosed for the first hour and then getting hardly any medication at all for the rest of hours before the next dose.   I'm pretty sure seroquel is one of those. 

These tips might help.  [https://dailycaring.com/11-ways-to-get-someone-with-dementia-to-take-medication/](https://dailycaring.com/11-ways-to-get-someone-with-dementia-to-take-medication/)   

Finding a calm and quiet time to take the meds helps because her brain has a much harder time focusing on one thing when a lot if information is coming at her all at once.    It's like when you're driving somewhere you've never been before and traffic is crazy---you have to turn off the radio and tell all your passengers stop talking so you can focus all your attention on driving. 

Putting the pills in a daily pill organizer can help because you don't have medication bottles out.  The pill organizer is one thing, vs. many pill bottles.  It also helps if MIL refuses her medication because she thinks she's already taken her pill for the day--the organizer ""tells"" her she hasn't taken Monday's pill yet, not you.

Taking your pills together can help, too.  (If you don't need to take meds, take a tic-tac candy.)   She can see what you are doing, and it reminds her of what she needs to do.   You can follow up with a sweet (or sugar free) snack.

Does she have a favorite glass/mug she likes to drink out of?  Is there a piece of music that she likes and puts her in a good mood?   

What time of day is she in the best mood?  Morning might be better if she gets agitated in the evening.  Check with the doctor to see if she can take the med at the best time of day for her.   

Does she respond better to one than family member than another?  

Do some breathing exercises or something calming before you approach her.  (I know it's easier said than done. )  Since she's already anxious--if she is interpreting your body language to say there's an unknown danger around her, she's going to want to focus on that and not on taking pills.

 If she refuses at first, come back in 15 minutes, she might change her mind.

People of MIL's generation are sometimes more likely to listen to an authority figure.  This video shows how they had a trusted family doctor write a note saying that the patient needed these pills.  https://www.uclahealth.org/dementia/refusal-to-take-medications#:\~:text=Expert%20explanation%3A%20REFUSAL%20TO%20TAKE,approach%20is%20to%20stay%20calm.
Does she have a drink that she particularly likes?
I move quickly, ""heres a piece of chocolate for you, and a drink, oh here have this (meds), and oh this piece of chocolate is awesome have a bite"". Each thing i put in her hand otherwise it gives her time to think about it. I then shift to something happening on tv or outside and slow the patter down until we are quiet visiting again.. So far so good.

Dementia,Normal dementia progression or delirium,"Hi all, 

My grandfather 93 years old has dementia that has been progressing fairly quickly. I even notice a big difference in the past 2 weeks. 

My question is: how can I know what is his dementia progressing vs delirium? 

He had an episode of delirium in September, and again 3 weeks ago but the hospital didn’t catch it and they assumed he had Covid even if he has zero symptoms. PCR and rapid tests all came back negative and they sent him home. He is extremely intelligent and if you don’t know him you wont notice the extent of his confusion. He basically tells the same story over and over again about how he was a microbiologist and could have worked in a hospital but ended up vice-dean of medicine at our university etc etc 

This past week he has become completely obsessed with a watch that was “stolen” and he sleeps a lot during the day. 

He called me an hour ago and couldn’t tell me the name of the residence where he was (unusual), apparently had called the reception at the residence because he wanted a list of all the employees that were working Easter (when he thinks his watch was taken). The receptionist told him he couldn’t have that information and he got very agitated. He called me to tell me his frustrations and asking for a lawyer wanting to sue the residence.","Have they tested for a UTI?
Is it possible his watch was stolen? While these are usually delusions... It's not inconceivable.

At 93 years old, the smallest thing can cause cognitive hits.  A cold, a fall, UTI, etc.

Urinalyses should always include a urine culture but don't often do.  Have there been any other issues except for the watch and trouble naming his facility?
Delirium is acute onset typically caused by infection or potentially miss use of medication or the potential for electrolyte imbalance.

Dementia would be long lasting.

As a registered nurse when I hear from my families, I’m a visiting nurse, that their loved one has a sudden personality or behavior change I think I have delirium versus dementia. And then I start asking questions to try to determine if there’s an infection involved, and electrolyte in balance which can because if there’s frequent loose stools or nausea with vomiting or alcohol misuse or abuse, and then review medications.

If the patient is diabetic or has a history of pre-diabetes also checked her blood sugar.

Our mother is highly educated and very resistant to help. She has always said she doesnt want to be in a home but it's a safety concern at this point. What are some ways we can ease the transition for her? How do others prepare their loved ones for the change? We expect her to be emotionally hostile and want to make things are easy for her as possible. Thank you.","One thing I did with my mom was acknowledge how sucky this is and that it’s not fair but it is necessary. She needed to grieve this further loss of independence. I didn’t want to invalidate her feelings by only focusing on the positive and saying that it’s not so bad. Or ‘you’re going to love it’.  At that time of transition she needed validation and support while she grieved, not to have those feelings brushed off. 

When she pushed back against moving I told her that it is either the new home or the hospital geriatric unit, but living on her own was no longer an option. I wouldn’t get caught up in justifications for staying independent but held firm to saying ‘living alone is not an option’ on repeat.
We made the wrenching decision to move my dad to memory care about a month ago (also in California; $8000/month).  We debated whether to tell him in advance since we knew he would be resistant and also that he would forget shortly after we told him and then would have to  have the argument all over again, and again, and again….  But we didn’t feel comfortable just taking him there, without at least some effort to tell him what was coming.  My sister and I finally told him over lunch at a (nice-ish) restaurant, about 5 days prior.  He took it well at lunch, so we continued to mention it as the days counted down.  On the way there, he asked me several times, “now where are we going?”, and I would tell him we were going to a new place where he could get more help (and left it vague for how long).  He was nervous and increasingly uneasy as we got there.  We stayed for lunch.  By the time we left - after a couple of hours - he threw an absolute fit.  He swore at us, told us he hated us, we are the worst daughters in the world, told us he would leave…  It was awful.  While we heard advice to not visit for a couple of weeks to help him acclimate, we couldn’t do that.  I have gone there almost every week day and my sister has gone every weekend.  After a month, he has kind of settled in.  I don’t think he really remembers his previous house, although he does occasionally mention “going home” (but who knows what that means).  No sugar coating, it has been really, really, really hard and sad.  But it had to be done and we waited as long as possible (in part of preserve his money; he should have enough to last 4 years which should be enough, based on what we see).  One good thing is that he was able to take his elderly golden retriever with him (although both he and Dad seem to be “marking their territory” more than we would like, LOL!).  Part of the reason I go there almost everyday is to check on the dog.
I was lucky and my dad first went into Assisted Living. The facility made the call that he had to go to memory care. My mom will be another story. She is so independent minded and developed so many strategies to hide her declining abilities.
This is the absolute worst decision. My heart goes out to you. I had to make the same decision 6 months ago and it was horrific. My mum has always been an incredibly sharp person. Highly intelligent. Fiercely independent. A will like iron. It took for her to have a very bad fall for us to be able to even raise the subject of us not being able to keep her safe. Before that she wouldn't entertain the suggestion that she wasn't coping. Eventually the hospital raised their concerns with me and the situation was taken out of my hands initially. She was admitted to intermediate care, but after a month of that I realised I was ill from trying to look after her, have a career a relationship and run my own home. We talked about it often and eventually after promising her I would find a good care home she agreed. It took time, but now she's cared for and safe. It's the best decision I ever made and it felt excruciating.

I did have power of attorney though. That and the knowledge that she wouldn't be safe unless I went through with it helped me power through. 

Best of luck.
What about discussing it at a doctor’s appointment so you can have the doctor back you up?
We were dreading this. By the time we got to that point mom was beyond rational explanation (though, honestly, baseline Mom would have refused also). We waited too long and she had declined too much for our first choice assisted living facility. Her last act of refusal was actually to pass away the week she was finally scheduled to move.
Sorry to not answer but can I just comment on how lucky you are to have this problem? My moms pension isn’t enough to cover a facility and her children cannot subsidize her without going into debt. There are public facilities here but they’re horrendous. What a dream it would be to drop her off in memory care. I’d happily deal with her anger and resentment for some actual help. 

Rejoice that you have this option and drop her off and silently celebrate.
My parents lived on an acreage, the house was old.  It was getting towards winter in November.  We told them we wanted them to move to town for a few months over winter so we could have some big updates done to the house.  They had already visited the facility(Assisted Living).  So we packed the up and drove them to town.  We had already set up the apartment for them and they liked it!  Then covid hit, so we kept them there.  Dad is still there, Mom broke a hip and is now in a care facility nearby.
Your story sounds so much like mine and my momma. She was resistant to EVERYTHING!! We unfortunately had to fib to help make the transition. We told her that it was for “rehabilitation” for a few physical things she was having and that they were going to help her get stronger. She bought that and did okay initially. We had some rough days but the staff was so amazing with her. Sadly she went downhill very quickly and passed away on April 14th. She still knew who we all were and went peacefully. For that I am so grateful! 🌹
My biggest issue is cost. My mother is getting there sooner than I had hoped but memory care facilities here in California where we live costs around 8k to 10k a month. Can’t afford that :(
We waited until she said yes.  She said no for a long time.  Then, I told her that some of these places have lot of concerts, which excited her.  I told her that she could tour them and see if she liked them.  She took a tour, chose one she liked, and then we moved her in.  

Ultimately what worked was for me to remove any sense of coercion.  Not telling her what she had to do, not having a serious discussion.  But instead finding a reason she might like it, telling her in an excited voice, and then giving her the decision-making power.  It's the essence of something called motivational interviewing, which is highly successful during substance abuse treatment.  It's based on the principle that coercion leads to resistance.
We started talking to mum about moving to a ""condo"". Then brought her for a tour and she loved it. And that was that!
At our care home we generally encourage the families to tell them that they are only coming for a short stay, or that they're staying at a hotel for a while.
First, it basically sucks. For me with my wife, after five years of refusing to even see a doctor, a episode of violence made it imperative. So while she was in the hospital in San Diego, I arranged everything to move her into a facility back in Phoenix. Drove back with our son and just brought her there. It was beyond not pretty, but necessary. 

That was three weeks ago, and she’s not happy, but also not real agitated. Probably just resigned to the situation. 

But now planning on moving her elsewhere with more residents and more activities. And she wants to be involved with that change, which is probably a good thing. 

Stay tuned snd good luck to you and follow your instincts.
We’re struggling with this exact situation. It’s especially heartbreaking because one of the worst fears my mom has is being placed in a home.
Devastating. My heart goes out to you and your family
If she’s going to memory care, she must be pretty advanced. Do you think she’ll remember the conversation if you have it ahead of time, or will it just cause additional unnecessary pain?

For my mom we had to first travel cross country from her home to to an AL/memory care near our house. We were afraid that talking about AL would make her refuse to travel. What we discussed was coming to live near us and her grandchildren, and how we’d be able to give her the medical care she needed. That sounded great to her. With dementia you don’t always have to answer every question with full depth details. It’s surprising how simple and vague answers can often satisfy their curiously and keep them happy. So we just left things vague. She had some concerns about our house (too many stairs) so I would say you’re right and we’re looking at ways that you don’t have to deal with the stairs.

Then when we arrived we went straight to AL and told her it was her own apartment so she could still have privacy, and circled back on her stairs concerns (no stairs, yay!), but we’d see each other all the time, and as a plus the place had nurses/house keeping/restaurant. We were lucky that she just went with it. It’s not perfect but for the most part she’s fallen into a routine.",2022-04-29 08:55:47,RNCbyME,uelbf4
Dementia,"father showing signs of dementia, but he refuses to make any changes to keep himself healthy","hi, my father (70) just retired and i have been spending more time calling and spending time with him because of that. he was always the type to want to work 24/7, so it really took a lot to have him actually retire. anyways, the last couple years i did notice him being more forgetful than usual, telling me the same story multiple times, etc. but i assumed it was just him being very busy with work and such. lately, it’s been more than just that though. for example, the other day, i asked my dad if he had my birth certificate since i needed to renew my passport. next time i came to visit, he gave me the documents in an envelope and said it was the documents for my background check at work. 
this worried me since i did ask him for similar papers for a background check at work, but that was a whole year ago. 

i’ve always been worried about him as he’s aged and i asked him to cut back on his drinking and have a healthier diet. while he has been cutting down on fatty foods and high sodium, he absolutely refuses to cut down alcohol. he has at least one beer with every meal. he says he rather be dead than give up his choice of meal accompaniment. i also mentioned that he should get a check up soon, but he says that is also not necessary as he’s already old. im wondering if anyone had any advice of how to go about this. did you have a family member who refused to be healthy or even see a doctor? is there anything i can do myself to help him if he refuses to do something himself?","We were concerned about my father 15 years ago when he started showing signs of forgetfulness.  I tried to get his GP to look into it, but they only gave him the five-word memory test, which he gamed (and games to this day).  Another year I wrote the doctor a letter, which got put in his file, which my father saw when the doctor retired and his medical records were transferred... he didn't let me forget about that any time soon.

FWIW, 15 years later and my dad has declined, but is still independent and alive.  He quit driving between then and now (he scared himself), and he's slowly coasted into a sedate, stay-at-home life.  He's in physiotheraphy currently, so there is at least 90 minutes of ""light workout"" weekly, but it's inadequate and the mobility isn't good.

No degree of hounding your father will get him to do something he doesn't want to do.  Your father will never be healthier than he is today. You've got a potentially long decline ahead of you.  Let him have his beer, enjoy his  presence, and in the word of someone else, remember that you won't be remembered for what you did, but for how you made him feel.
My mom refused and even tricked doctors for awhile. She self isolated to hide it and things got worse fast. Even after diagnosis she denied help from speech and occupational therapists, doctors, etc. 

I wish there was a magic way to convince them. Her doctor warned her that if she refused, she'd decline quickly and irreversibly, and she did.
My dad never made any lasting changes either. My brother and I were always trying to bring up nutrition, sleep and exercise. However, he chose to stay up late, eat lots of sweets, and never exercise. However, who knows if the changes would have helped. It seems like the foundation for dementia are laid much earlier in life.",2022-04-28 21:57:26,gardenbat,ueb3d0
Dementia,MCI to progression or dementia signs,"My quite-a-lot older sister was diagnosed with MCI about 4 years ago. She is now 61. I haven’t observed much other than mild forgetfulness over those years, but just lately, like last 4 months or so, she is saying things that are way out of character. Insults, complaints, really mean jokes about me, totally out of the blue. She also seems to be unable to talk and do a task now, like if we are cleaning the kitchen after a meal, she seems not to hear. Does this mean anything?","I’ll start by saying, I am not a Dr.

Contact your sister’s primary Dr. She may have started new meds, or existing ones she is taking are not working or at levels in her system that are not therapeutic. An adjustment or new meds may need to be done by her medical team. 

Also, urinary track infections can exacerbate some conditions, so have a true work up done to evaluate all possible causes.

Good luck.",2022-04-28 19:05:41,RINalaska,ue7tci
Dementia,Wondering about fixations..,"Hi everyone, my mother late 60’s has received a dementia diagnosis. We are awaiting a second MRI. 
Her Dr. does not believe it is Alzheimer’s, she does show signs of Frontal dementia.
I have recently noticed a large increase in her fixation level. She has become very fixated on some current events she sees online and has begun to talk about it non-stop. I have tried changing the subject, asking other questions and redirecting her but it feels constant.
I don’t know if I should says something or if it would matter. It feels like the conversation is so one sided and I could almost not be there. She would just keep talking about this topic. 
Part of it is grief also, I don’t know if this is a dementia symptom but it feels unlike her and like something has shifted again. Like another loss. Like it’s not even her, just so sad. I have to not think about that part, feels like she is turning into a different person I don’t even know.
Just wondered if anyone else has experienced this ? 
Thanks for reading and a place to vent.","My mom was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia about a year ago, but has been showing symptoms for a few years now. She’s 66. There are a few fixations at this point: she watches sports religiously, knits every day, and obsessively checks the items in her fridge, often wanting to go shopping every couple of days. The food in the fridge often goes bad because she eats less than she buys. 
It’s really hard to witness. The person sitting in the living room physically is my mom, but the personality I’ve known my whole life is gone. Conversations are short, and we often talk about the same things each day at the same hours. 
Make sure to take care of yourself throughout the process. My brothers, along with my wife and I, have been trading days staying with her until we are able to get a full time caretaker with her. 
Keep the good memories, but know that her day to day life will change. It could change quickly, or could take many years. The best you can do is make sure she’s comfortable and taken care of, and that you’re taking care of yourself.
My dad has fronto temporal lobe. And he has a lot of fixations as well. The best thing I found is just to go with it, don't try to talk him out of it or disagree that makes him angry and it seems like he just digs in. But if I just go along with it and make it seem like it's no big deal in a few days he moves on to some other obsession. It's frustrating I know. After the 10th time I'm not really even listening. He doesn't seem to notice.
Yes. It's kind of weird, in that all the resources tell you ""distract and redirect"" when the person with dementia gets agitated about something, but I tried, how I tried, and with my dad it never worked. He had Lewy Body, initially diagnosed as frontotemporal, and I think that was part of the issue. For a long time, his memory was okay. It was his cognition that was broken. So he could retain the (totally irrational and frequently insane) ideas that came into his head and couldn't be distracted. 

I wish I had a solution for you. Eventually I gave up trying to stop the fixation, and just kept an eye on him to make sure he didn't hurt himself or anyone else until he exhausted himself, went to sleep, and reset back to normal until the next episode. Nothing else seemed to work, although I did notice that certain things, like stuff he'd seen on TV, were triggers. It was like he'd latch on to them and build a whole crazy story around them. Limiting the exposure to triggers helped.

e: fixing autocorrect
I am sorry you are having to deal with this.    My sister also has frontal lobe damage from lymphoma and this describes what we are seeing - she is deep down many rabbit holes in politics and religion and we’ve been trying to shift the topics to no avail - and yes she too gets angry when we do not jump on board with the narrative 😓.

Dementia,I was just getting my life together and now I am a care giver.,"I (23 F) am about to graduate with my masters degree in nutrition and am basically guaranteed a position at a local veteran's hospital. I've lived with my family for the duration of college. At first I did it to avoid the expenses of dorming/renting, but it has basically led me into being my 71 year old dad's caregiver. 

My dad was in a car accident right before I graduated highschool about 6 years ago and had a bad concussion. His memory was a little fuzzy afterward, but totally understandable given the accident. Ever since then though, he had been declining and has gotten especially worse the past 2 years. My mom and I have had to take away the car keys and so someone has to drive him to appointments. We have to cook for him because he can't be trusted with a stove or oven, and even basic foods we have to do because he, for example, will not make a sandwich unless we get everything out of the fridge and set it in front of him. He can't be left alone because he will call people non stop on his cell phone and get very agitated. Even when he is home he still tries to do this, so then I take his phone, and instead he will constantly ask me for the phone back or where it is. We tried sending him to a senior center during the day while I was at an internship and my mom was at work, but he would call us non stop and tell us he was bored and wanted to come home. And then would also get agitated at the center. We have to lay clean clothes out for him and remind him to take a shower, brush his teeth, etc. 
    And his most recent development is that if someone is asleep while he is awake, he thinks they are sick and will repeatedly wake them up to ask if they are okay. Problem is, he gets up at 5 AM and I sleep late (like 10 AM). So from 5 AM until whenever I get out of bed, he is waking me up every 20 minutes to ask if I'm okay. When I am inevitably tired in the afternoon and want to lay down for a nap, he does the same thing. Oh and of course he can do basically no household chores unless he is supervised like a hawk, which at that point it's not really help anymore. I feel like I am taking care of a 6 year old. 

And well, I'm just sick of all this. It's not like I was never expecting to be a care giver for my parents, just not this early when I am just establishing myself. Like my parents really didn't start caring for theirs until they were in their 40s.  I feel like I have no life. If a friend invites me out somewhere, I have to either decline becsuse my dad will be home alone, or I have to arrange for him to go to the senior center and then subject my mom to his torrent of phone calls (and I know I can't just take his phone away then, because then he will harass one of the supervisors their to call my mom for him). And now my mom doesn't want me to move out because, well, she can't care for my dad on her own, and so I have no privacy at home to have a relationship with someone. If I did ever move out I feel like she will have no choice but to put him in a SNF, which I don't ever want as I spent part of my internship working at one and they are just sad and pathetic.

I have a younger brother, but he moved out years ago and is not going to come back to be a caregiver as he just got offered a full time position at a lab he works at. Nor should he have to be a caregiver at 22. 

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I guess I am just ranting.","This right here is why I refuse to let my young adult daughter put her life on hold because of her dad’s diagnosis. I will put him in a care facility when I need more help. She deserves a life. I’m sorry your mom is putting pressure on you to give up your life.
Your Mum is going to have to figure this out.  Tell her today, she let your brother go and now she has to let you go too.  You cannot sacrifice your youth and your career to your Father's dementia and she has NO RIGHT to ask it from you.  No right whatsoever.  You've already sacrificed enough, he's your father, not your husband.  I feel so bad for you kiddo, you graduate and go get that job and start your life.  You deserve this and to be guilt free too.
I would rather divorce my dementia spouse and have the state figure out his care than ever ask this of my child.
I agree that it is unfair of your mother to ask this of you.  I can also see that you likely don't feel you can insist on moving out (though you undoubtedly should).  I suggest that your mother make sure that your father's doctor has experience with dementia and ask the doctor to address his constant agitation.  I also encourage you and your mother both to research memory care facilities nearby.  Not all are the grim, soulless places you have experience with.  Especially if your mother visits often and uses the facility more as the additional support you and the daycare center supply instead of as his sole source of care.  These years are precious for you to establish your adult life and career and no good parent would ask you to sacrifice that.
NO WAY IM ALSO (23 F) CARING FOR MY (67) MOM do you want to be friends, I relate to this so much :( I wrote a post about struggling with all of this semi-recently, a long rant. I'm an only child adopted by a single mom so it's just me and her and all the responsibility has been on me. My mom has no long term or short term memory, accidentally started starving herself, and I am running the household now and managing all the bills. PM me if you wanna talk about it all because it's hard to find people our age going through this, I would love to connect
I’m so sorry you are going through this. Can you speak with a senior’s social worker?  They may be able to arrange for a personal care worker to come into your home. Where I live it is subsidized based on your income. The senior’s centre should be able to help you access some resources
As someone much older who has a parent with dementia, I cannot imagine how awful it must be to care for a parent when you yourself are in the prime of life and needing to get established in your own career and yes, enjoy everything life has to offer.

Is there a senior resource center for your community?  If not, I would ask at the senior day care about options.   Medication can also be helpful if there is increased agitation and a consult with a neurologist or psychiatrist who works with dementia patients might be very helpful.

Keep looking at facilities.  I searched forever and found a smaller place for my mom that is full of activities, gardens, rabbits, live music and more and it was less than a corporate run facility.   There are some awful places out there, but there are some rare good ones, too.  

There is also the option of respite care at some nursing homes/care centers if you need a longer break in the meantime.  It may not be optimal but if it is safe and clean, make use of it because you need to take care of yourself.
You and mom have to create an exit ramp. Talk to his doctor about his meds; Keep looking for a better care facility. This is not the adult life that your parents imagined for you when you were a newborn infant in their arms. Not if they were good parents.
Move out.
I sympathize with you  especially at a young age while trying to get your life started, then life goes not so fast. 

I'm older but in the same boat, had to move out of my appartment move back home to take care of mom all because she didn't have her legal work in order. It's a mess. I'll be here for at least a year. 

Also greatly sympathize with the interrupted sleep, my mom while I'm sleeping will ask me until I wake up if I'm asleep.  Just leave me the fuck alone for 4 hrs please.",2022-04-28 13:05:37,Ms_Digglesworth,udzus3
Dementia,"""Crunch crunch crunch - mmm, these are tasty, unusual but.."" - What are you eating there mum? EH? Wait, NNNOOOOO!! They're KITTY KIBBLES we brought with us, to feed the magpies with, that's CAT FOOD!! LMAO","So yes, we went on a picnic to the park.  I'd put some cat kibbles in an old bread-bag, to feed lurking cheeky magpies with - I'd TOLD HER, look we'll bring some of these cat-food nugget-things for the maggies who always turn up hoping for snacks.  ""Ok"" she says.

We'd had our sandwiches, there were various other snacks in the basket too.  Whilst I was reading magazine mum was grazing the snacks, I heard loud crunching and looked over to see her with the bread bag and a handful of kitty-kibbles.  CRUNCH CRUNCH eating it like popcorn.

NNOOOOOO  Mum!!   ""But, the bag says 'Fig & Sultana', not 'cat food'!!?""    Yes mum, it's an OLD bread bag, it's cat food we brought with us from home, for the magpies!!!!      ""Hmm, really?  Well, whatever they are, ok they're a bit odd but, tasty anyway.""     lmao.....   :)

Anyone else some funnies recently?  ","Oh. Boy.

My dad had an empty bag of dog treats on his side table, I asked him if he gave them all to the dog and he said no, he ate them. I told them they were dog treats and he didn't believe me.

We've got some disposable plastic toilet seat covers, kind of like the kind you would take to the park, to help keep my dad's toilet.. cleanish. I keep them on a shelf in his bedroom in an old butter tub. The other day he comes out of his room with four or five little blue packets in his hand and I said what do you got there dad? He said I think it's butter. I said well what are you going to do with that and he said I'm going to eat it! I told him it wasn't butter, but I could get him some butter if he wanted, and he asked me now why the hell would I want to eat butter?

One night I was in bed and I rolled over to check the camera, and I'm half asleep and he's got this long white rope or something I can't quite tell what he's doing. So I go in there and he's got the entire packet of adult wipes busted open like a bag of chips and piles of wipes just everywhere. I said what are you doing Dad and he said I'm folding up the toilet paper and I said well why are you folding up the toilet paper it's 1:30 in the morning what are you doing and he said I'm going to eat it! I said why are you going to eat the toilet paper? Are you hungry? He said no I'm not hungry and why the hell would I eat toilet paper!

One morning I found his oximeter completely broken apart. Check the cameras to see what he had done. He busted it open and pried the finger pads out with a spoon and put them each in his mouth. He thought it was yogurt?

The best though was when he found the baggie of pot cookies and ate them all. THAT was a fun day. He had the giggles and was more coherent and lively than he'd been in a long time. 

Gotta laugh, just gotta roll with it.
Yes! I give my uncle magazine's and coupons to look at or cut pictures out of but I never suspected he would be tearing out the pages and eating them! 

He's also eaten unpopped popcorn kernels lol. Now I'm constantly watching things around him. You have to have a sense of humor dealing with all this craziness.",2022-04-28 08:44:11,lookthepenguins,udu4t7
Dementia,How can I make her feel good?,"Hello, I'm taking care of an old lady (87). Been doing so for awhile now. Started by visiting her every evening to chat and give her her meds. Her health has been declining rapidly over the last year (we suspect that an operation caused the outbreak of her dementia, it's gotten worde since an operation at the start of the year which caused her to be wheelchair bound). I am not her primary caregiver but I watch her and keep her company every once in a while so her live-in caregiver can take a break. 

I started putting lotion on her handy, filing her fingernails (as far as possible, due to her wheelchair her hands are more like claws and she can't really stretch her fingers without pain), brushing her hair, putting on music or the TV and chat. It's mostly me talking since she rarely interacts with me. I talk about watever is on my mind and ask her questions. We have a game here but I tried to play with her UNO twice last year and that did not work at all.

How can I make her feel better? She can't leave the house (no ramp), is not interested in games or looking at photos I show her.","Oh you Sound like a nice Person, caring for this old lady.

It’s simple things you can do like reading to her (easy stuff, maybe a magazine with pictures),

playing music from the time she was younger or maybe she has a taste in music (maybe you can dance with her in her wheelchair), 

looking at pictures of animals or older times (maybe she has an album with old pictures of herself)- maybe there are certain pictures she is more interested in than others

If you can, let her look outside the window (by day), bring flowers and let her look at them

Some older patients also like dolls or stuffed animals, as they can care for them and caress them

Eat something nice together, enjoy something.
Make her feel safe and she will open up more and trust you. Whenever actively engaging with a person with Alzheimer's/Dementia keep in mind that whatever they perceive to be real is their reality. If playing cards with her and she makes up her own rules then follow along with her. Does she like sweets? That's the last thing to go away as far as tasting foods so if she isn't diabetic then ask her what she likes and get her some. And remember, Alzheimer's/Dementia people are trying to give anyone a hard time, they are simply having a hard time. And the surgery she had exacerbated her dementia. Anyone with Alzheimer's/Dementia should never have any kind of anesthesia as they never recover and it actually increases the rate of progression for this disease. Bless your heart for helping.
My dad loved hearing me teach my kid lessons (homeschooling). He absolutely loved hearing me teach his grandchild (8 years old) high-school level classes with lectures.
 He also really liked hearing me and my girlfriend talk about plans and problems. 
 It was like a drama unfolding and he gets to experience it. You could see in his eyes that he was completely invested in it. 
 Music. Playing music that he loved and music that was new but he liked. Sometimes the new music was ""too weird "" 🤣🤣🤣.
 Life wasn't stopping and waiting for him to die,  so it kept giving him things to think about. 
 He's busy sleeping away his last days now. I think he feels comfortable that we will be okay without him now.... even though I'm not so sure.
Have you tried listening to music with her?  Pick something that would have been popular when she was young, wherever she grew up.   Music doesn't demand as much concentration as anything with a plot, and it is remembered long after many other things have been forgotten.
I used to visit a lady in the nursing home discovered she loved hymns. It started when I offered to sing Amazing Grace for her one day when I said goodbye, and then ended with me printing song sheets that she kept in her bedside table and ending our visits with a couple old hymns (simple versions). After a while she would sing along if I sang slowly enough. Even if she didn't try to sing, she would always look interested and attentive. I ended with ""God bless you and keep you, I'll see you soon"" and it was always a nice way to say goodbye. 

It's very hard to make someone feel better, but by trying different small things in a calm way, sometimes a little breakthrough happens.
For my family member, I found that reading a book to her was very entertaining to her while she was in the early to mid stages.  Now that she is in the late stages, she isn't interested in that, but she does like it when I show her picture books (books of dogs, pretty buildings, and nice scenery).  For a while, she really enjoyed children's chapter books - nothing too scary or serious.
If you have time to do some research there may be an organization near you that does things like building ramps and small repairs for the elderly. My husband is a volunteer for one and through the years has built many ramps, repaired damaged walls, plumbing and that type of thing. The organization usually runs on donations from companies so it doesn't cost the homeowner anything. It would be nice to be able to get her outside this summer.
My grandmother loved praying the rosary, we also played 1950s music. she loved Elvis, Buddy Holly, and Harry Belafonte. Sweets are a big hit too. If you have a dog or cat who could sit in her lap, she might enjoy that. And streaming PBS shows on tv, my grandma enjoyed nature documentaries and Finding Your Roots
She probably loves all that you do! I’m in my twenties and I’d be peachy if I had a friend brushing my hair and chatting to me. Sounds super relaxing. It’s a bummer there’s no ramp to get out. Maybe open up windows when weather allows or sit in the sun that shines in.",2022-04-28 05:28:29,small_town_girl96,udr2hr
Dementia,"My mom (66, dementia) calls her mom when she's confused about where she is","Anybody else have a situation like this? My mom (66) is the one with dementia; Grandma (90) is healthy for her age. I suspect Grandma's phone number is the only one Mom remembers, since it's been the same for the last 40 years. She calls at least a couple of times a week, often when she's confused about where she is, and sometimes at inappropriate times because she forgets about the 3 hour time zone difference. Mom is not in danger; 99% of the time, she's at home in her own living room and just doesn't realize it. Grandma lives 3,000 miles away, so there's nothing she can do anyway - the phone calls are just causing her distress. It's got to be torture to know her oldest child is suffering like this. 

I don't want to prevent my mom from calling her mom, but maybe there's a way to keep the phone calls to decent hours?  Also, Grandma is healthy for a 90 year old, but isn't going to live forever. What do we do when she's not available to answer the phone anymore?

Background: Mom has been showing signs of cognitive decline for about 10 years and was diagnosed almost 2 years ago. No one else on her side of the family has had any kind of dementia that we know of. My dad (72) is managing most of my mom's care at home. However, he sleeps a lot more than she does, so he's not always aware of what she's doing. And he seems opposed to bringing in outside help. I live relatively closest of all my siblings, but I'm still about 90 minutes away and can't get over there very often.","My dad is confusing evening with morning... so as we are winding down for the night around sunset, he's asking what we are going to do today, and saying what a beautiful morning it is. This can cause some headaches when he tries to call people.

So we put a Post-It note on the phone that says when it is OK to call people.

He reads the note, checks the time and is shocked it is evening and not morning, and respects the note.

Sometimes simple solutions are the best. (Especially if it is in his handwriting. Then he knows he wrote it... but doesn't remember writing it. But it carries more weight when he writes the note and reads the message in his own handwriting.)
If your Grandma has told you the calls are distressing her then something does need to be done. 

Maybe Grandma can turn off the ringer after a certain time of day.  And have regular scheduled calls to establish a routine.  You could get an activity calendar for your Mum that you can put on the fridge or wall that would show her when her Mum is going to call her and when she is going to call Mum.  And then like a whiteboard or something.  'That's a really good question for Grandma.  Let's write it down for when she calls tomorrow at 2pm'.  I don't know, it might help.
Hopefully others will pop in and give you some suggestions.  Have you contemplated moving them closer to where you or some of the siblings live? It may not be practical but this is what I did with my parents who both have dementia. They lived about 90 minutes drive from me also.

My mother has Alzheimer's but was the better of the two.  Moving for them was the only practical thing I could do as they lived in a small country town with limited facilities and when Dad lost his licence due to the dementia we saw no alternative even though they were getting in home help for a few years prior.

Do you think she can read off a whiteboard your number and instructions to call you instead? I often have to write notes on the fridge whiteboard so mum doesn't ring me 10 times  day while I'm at work.

My Dad stopped being able to read once we moved them closer and he did deteriorate over the year since they moved.  But he significantly deteriorated after he had covid and was in hospital to the point he's now in a nursing home.  I do wonder if the move was detrimental but felt we had no choice as I'm constantly having to take care of everyday issues like doctor appointments and paying bills... And I just thank god they are only 10 minutes from me now.
I would see why Dad seems opposed to the help. Maybe if he has the opportunity to meet and talk with someone from an in home care company, it might put him at ease. We live with my Grandma but I'm dealing with burnout. To help we are just starting with 1 day a week for 4 hours. Today will be the 1st full day. We met last week and did 2 hours just to see how Grandma did. She enjoyed the company. If your Mom likes to be social, it may be a good outlet for her. Depending on the company and level of care, they can help with housework, laundry, food, medications, and play games or read. 
He may be resistant just because it's a scary thought to him to have a ""stranger"" come in. But maybe after meeting with the company/nurse/caregiver it would give him piece of mind.
Question OP, how is your mom making those phone calls? With a landline or a cell phone. If it is a cell phone is it android or apple?
You might check out teleCalm. You can set quiet hours and lots of other features specifically for dementia.
Just get grandma to take the phone off the hook when she is going to bed. Nothing could be so important to wake her.",2022-04-28 04:24:39,bibibethy,udq8li
Dementia,"My mom has dementia, is bedbound and has a broken tooth","I'm a caregiver for my mom (79). 

I noticed last week that one of her front teeth had chipped. This week I looked again and more of the same tooth has broken off. She is indicating that the tooth is painful. 

She has been bedbound since September 2021. 

Has anyone else had this happen? If so, how did you handle it?","Taking my mom to the dentist was extremely difficult.  She had to be sedated and sure enough, once she got to the practice, she would act up and behave so badly, the appointment had to be canceled.  Later in her decline she had a toothache that would come and go. Then Covid lockdown happened and it was 18 months.  Every time we revisited the dentist issue it was such an ordeal and we ended up just relieving the symptoms with OTC meds. I searched hi and low for a dentist who would visit assisted living places (such as a mobile van) but nothing existed in our area. 

Bottom line is if she is prone to combative behavior, you might have to have her lightly sedated and take her when the Rx has kicked in.  Call her dentist and ask for advice.
In my town there’s dentist services that drive to you ! Maybe there’s something like that around you :)
Try dental wax, unless you’re lucky enough to have dentist do house calls in your area.
My mum is also end stage early onset Alzheimer's. Her tooth chipped too and we got the dentist in to just put special stuff on it so it wasn't sharp. Mums bedbound as well and nonverbal. We also switched to non sugary drinks not even juice and making sure we clean her mouth with those little sponges. 

Her teeth may be crumbling due to the puree food coating them. Could be her meds like mums was.

Thinking of you in this hard journey x
Meanwhile—I know I've walked past temporary repair kits in pharmacies. I did a quick search and found a raft of them. There's also this page: https://www.dentaly.org/us/restorative-dentistry/temporary-filling-kit/

That it has an ""org"" domain suggests it ***may***  not be thinly disguised advertising. Does seem to contain useful pointers. 

I haven't used any of these resources; commenting because I knew such a thing existed, but not endorsing. There's also a sub r/Dentistry which may have more insight.
I’m not a dentist but I have heard there is an old school treatment using silver nitrate. It turns the teeth and the carries black but it’s supposed to be antibacterial and halt further decay. It is just swabbed on. It might be something to ask the dentist about.

Dementia,"Dementia runs in my family, How do I prevent it?","I'm a young female and Dementia has taken both my Great grandma and my grandmother, who I'm currently the caregiver for. How do I prevent it from effecting me? What can I do to live a long concious life?

I'm sorry if this is the wrong way to word this or wrong place to post","As someone who has a long family history of dementia, I have the same fear as you.  I was told I can't for sure stop it.

But you could try eating well, exercising, staying a good weight, keeping stress down, maintaining a good sleep schedule, qnd staying happy.

I read dementia was lower amongst populations that took care of their health better.  Think those populations were called blue zones.
I'm no expert, but what I have gleaned from my husband's medical providers includes good social interactions and learning new things.  Keeping your brain active is not about doing puzzles, it's about learning new things.  So make good friends and have interesting hobbies.  Be open to improving yourself mentally and emotionally.  Challenge yourself to keep learning.  All in addition to maintaining good physical condition.
While it may not produce miracles check out the book The End of Alzheimers by Dale Bredesen. There is research about decreasing systemic inflammation through diet and getting adequate exercise as a means of reducing risk.
Thank you everyone for your answers, I will do my best to keep up with my body and my brain ♡
Avoid drugs that have high anticholinergic properties, which include some antidepressants, antipsychotics, and allergy meds.

Good diet, play puzzle games (mentally challenging tasks), stay physically active. You have to do it for rest of your life, everyday. It is tough, I know.
I had my grandfather, several uncles, an aunt, and my dad.  However, my grandfather was married and divorced several times. Only his children from his marriage to my grandmother had it.  Whereas his offspring from other marriages didn't. 

On my mother's side, one uncle has it.  

I have been told diet and exercise.  Vitamins and supplements, especially those that work on cardiovascular and cognitive functions.  All those things should help either stave off dementia till you much older or lessen the severity.  

I know science is working on something, I hope they come up with soon.  It's disappointing whenever I hear of new cases of dementia from people.  Since my father and uncle (by marriage) died from it last year, I have had two friends tell me now their parent has been diagnosed with it.
I've been reading up on this too because my mother has dementia. There are no guarantees, but it does seem like keeping your body and mind active and eating well can help to some extent. I really hope that there are some research advances in the next 20-25 years. I have this huge fear I might have inherited her crappy genes.
Have the same concern and from reading, my understanding is to stay active both physically and mentally along with a good diet.

My dad had dementia and passed in 2018 and my mom is getting this way and is 88, my dad lived to be 89.


Here is a good resource.

Nothing can outright prevent dementia. There are several factors and causes believed to be responsible for dementia, and the weighting of importance for each of these is still broadly unknown. There are several correlations that seem to exist between habits of individuals and occurrence of dementia. Will following these tips totally mitigate your risk? Probably not, but if you are interested, here they are. 

* Learning a second language. (not just for dementia, but also to increase neuroplasticity and resilience to other types of brain trauma like strokes)
* There is some evidence that lower BMI = lower incidence of dementia.
* The more physical activity, the less frequent the cases of dementia.
* Lower sugar intake = less dementia risk (some places have called dementia / Alzheimer's Type III Diabetes, but I haven't researched this specifically)
* Consistently getting an adequate amount of sleep. It seems as though our brains are able to self-repair in some sense during sleep. Inadequate amounts of sleep are insufficient for this process to be carried out properly.
* Maintaining social connections and experiences.
It’s usually not actually genetic. There are only one or two relatively rare kinds of dementia which are hereditary. Alzheimer’s is not. You’re probably not at any increased risk. Improving cardiovascular health is probably the best thing you can do to reduce the risk of strokes, etc.
I have heard it summed up: If it’s good for your heart it’s good for your brain.
Another thing I forgot to mention, new research is also indicating that digestive health could be a factor. Having healthy probiotics in your digestive system can help. I've started making fermented foods at home, like yogurt and sauerkraut again. You can also buy probiotic supplements.",2022-04-27 21:36:46,narcissistich03,udjhql
Dementia,Rant (Vent),"I (47F)  have been living with my mom (89 vascular dementia) for awhile now and normally she is really good with me. Until she is not, and today has been one of the WORST days so far. It's confusing, cause she slept well last night after a couple of nights where we were up every two hours. She woke up in a decent mood and was was fine, until we went to the bathroom. It was not a good scene and I know that how you react sets the tone for the interaction sometimes. So I sat down on the edge of the tub and very gently tried to get her pants and depends off of her. Not a pretty sight, but was done. Though, she refused to let me clean her, or remove her top which was also soiled. We sat there for a long time, me trying to clean her up, her refusing and trying to do it herself, which was making it worse. She was threatening to hit me and kick me if I didn't leave her alone. I gave up and let her go back to bed, when she started trying to put it on me, and accusing me of doing and putting it on her. She got up hafl naked and just went back to bed. I cleaned up the bathroom, while breaking down and just got ready for her caregiver to arrive. The caregiver is still working on convincing her to shower... 

My mom has always been stubborn, but she took such pride in her appearence that this is just so shocking to me. Her primary care physician doesn't want to overmedicate her, so won't prescribed any pills for anxiety. This is just such a fucking shitty way for someone to have to be. It's cruel that this is happening to her. It's just a bad day, I know. Tomorrow may be better or not...","Does she have a neurologist in addition to her PCP?

Dementia,My grandfather passed away this morning,"This morning my grandfather passed away. I'm hoping that writing this it will help me get it out of my system. I had planned to go home this weekend since a hospice nurse told us that he has anywhere between 2 days and 2 weeks as of last night. I thought I would have one more chance to give him a hug and say goodbye, even if he didn't remember me. Now I'm just crying by myself in a shitty college dorm 

He has been struggling with vascular dementia for a while now but until he got covid in December he has been hiding how serious it is. He just sort of stopped talking as much. after covid it got much worse though, he stopped eating, began to forget us, his voice started going, and he rarely had the energy to even open his eyes let alone fight off the infections he got from his bedsores after spending all day in a wheelchair.

When I saw him in the care home it felt like he had already left. nothing can prepare you for the look of confusion they have when they don't remember you anymore. It takes them before they're gone. I visited him one last time the following weekend in the hospital as he was fighting off pnemonia, and he had been doing better. I was so hopeful that he would atleast make it till the end of the semester so I could visit him when I came home, I even had my dad facetime me every time he visited and I would always say bye with ""Hang in there popop, I love you"". I hope that inside he recognized me a little bit since even when he would give me the look of confusion he still called me ""buddy"". He made it till finals week, and im thankful that he held out as long as he did, even if I didnt get to say my final goodbyes.

My mom called me a few hours ago as I was studying to let me know, I knew what it was the second the phone rang.

Im going home to attend his wake and funeral in a couple of days.

This is one of the lowest lows ive ever felt.","My condolences op 💜

I am so so sorry.   Dementia is such a cruel disease, taking away our loved ones bit by bit.   Hang on to the good memories.  Remember all the times you facetimed your grandfather.  It mattered in those good moments you gave him.

Dementia,Caregiving is hard. I was too young.,"I’m so sorry if this isn’t the place to put this, but I need to hear something from a person who’s been a caregiver, who’s seen those with dementia at their worst. I feel so alone. 

I try so hard not to harbor any resentment for my grandparents. It’s not their fault. But I will never get closure and I will never get an apology because they don’t know what they did.

Both my grandparents moved in with my family when I was 13 because they both got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. My grandmother already had depression and my grandfather already had some sort of paranoia or schizophrenia. It went undiagnosed, but he was always rambling incoherently about people trying to follow him or steal his things, taping doors shut, and making odd “inventions” decades before his Alzheimer’s diagnosis. 

When they moved in, I did not sleep. I was developing an eating disorder before this, but the stress of feeding them, washing them, making sure they didn’t run away, calling the cops when they did, and being their full time caregiver was not easy. I almost died, and went into the hospital for a month to recover my weight.

My grandfather would run away, shuffle around the house, jiggle locked doors. Repeatedly he would stick paper clips and forks into my door to get in. He got in once and molested me. I don’t remember it well. I don’t blame him for this, I’m sure he was just confused despite being in the early stages. 

We got them into assisted living communities. They were constantly kicked out because my grandfather was violent and would beat the staff. He dragged a CNA down the hall by the hair. Countless times I would be woken up to go over there because the police were called. Again. 

My grandmother would refuse to change and bathe. I was always called in. She would beat me. Punch me in the face, kick me, stomp on my feet, scratch my hands, bite me, spit in my face. And I’d have to deal with it. 

I had to clean their house. They were hoarders. For a year straight coming off my deathbed I was heaving pounds of garbage and soiled clothes into six industrial sized dumpsters. 

I’m now dissociated. I can’t think. I get confused in the same ways they do, I don’t recognize myself and I don’t recognize others. Everything smells like their house. When I try to imagine a future it’s just one where someone is breaking into my room or beating me or making me clean or running at me and screaming or standing still and just staring at me with a blank look. My future is in this industry. I’m a CNA because it’s all I know, and despite constantly being reminded of what I’ve seen and been through, I can’t leave. This is who I am now.

The thought of making coffee makes me ill. 

I was 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. And I will never get an apology. It’s not their fault, of course it’s not. But I’m just so angry and broken. I feel I will never heal.","I am so sorry for this.. why did your parents not step up and help? With that said, please find some mental health care for yourself and find things that make you happy.
Being a caregiver is not who you are now. You can choose to be a caregiver now, or you can reject it. Please consider rejecting it and doing something else. Knowing how to do it does not mean you should do it. Do something for yourself, instead of what you think is expected of you.
Yes, you were so young. I am so sorry you weren't protected from this. Please please try to find some help to process this if you can, you deserve to have some relief. Sending you strenght
I’m so sorry your childhood and teenage years were stolen from you. You were traumatized; let’s call it what it is and be kind to yourself.  But it is possible to recover and not have it ruin your life forever.

It doesn’t have to be this way from now on. You’re not a punching bag for old sick people. Your adulthood can look entirely different if you want it to.
So sorry. It's a horrible disease.
I’m so sorry you went through this. I became a caregiver around 13 or 14 and it was so, so tough. And it just got worse and worse. I did not experience those type of extremes, but there was a point where my father got violent and I didn’t know what to do. Please try to remember your grandparents before they were sick…erase everything that happened afterwards. Hang in there. Maybe being a CNA isn’t for you. My sister was a CNA for a year and got totally sick of it after a year, and now she’s 27 in vet school. It’s not too late to change career paths, especially when your current path is linked to your trauma.
Dissociation is a serious symptom, and it means that you need to look after yourself. You may be struggling with depression, and while it is not easy to treat, there are ways to manage it. https://www.reddit.com//r/depression/wiki/giving_help . You could also have PTSD from the experience, that would not be unusual. Please seek help if you can, and you may want to consider a career change, at least for a while.
Please speak to a Grief Counselor, as soon as you can. These people are therapists who help people process through their grief, and rebuild a life on the other side.

You have lost a lot. People. Humanity. Love. Well-being.

Until you face those issues and work through them with a professional, you'll just keep spinning in this cycle of anger. An external force needs to be brought in to help you get your train on a new track that doesn't just go in circles, but makes progress towards the horizon.

You did the work with them, and it cost you a lot. But it doesn't have to KEEP costing you your life and happiness. There is more happiness beyond this grief, if you reach out to a professional for help.
You have fought bravely! Let your resilience and uncompromising and sacrificial love for your Grannys give you a huge sense of uncommon strength and greatness.
You’ve been through a lot. I have too. EMDR really helped me process my trauma the most of all therapies, and I felt much clearer afterwards. Please, please get some help. Trauma has huge effects on the brain, but with help, you can recover. Sending you so much love.",2022-04-27 16:47:46,RichZombieParty,uddh5f
Dementia,What's the goal? [Rant],"Hi all, this is just a rant of some feelings I finally figured out how to word and I'm wondering if anyone else feels this way about caretaking.

I'm used to working towards goals in my life and I feel like with dementia caretaking there doesn't seem to be one. Obviously the goal is to care for them to the best of our abilities, make them as comfortable and peaceful as possible, and ensure they don't harm themselves or others through accidents. But it feels like these goals are constantly contradicting themselves or that what ""caring"" for them entails changes drastically. Some examples that are bothering me right now are that when my grandpa's GI problem acts up we have to switch him to a bland diet but his quality of food/nutrients drastically decreases, and it feels like by addressing one problem we're neglecting other concerns. He has chronic back problems and when we do things to try and help he refuses, but will continue doing puzzles that strain his back. We all know he shouldn't do puzzles to the extent he does, but it's one of his only hobbies left. He loves doing yardwork and housework and it's when he's happiest, but he's never content to do the small things that are safe for him and instead he wants to mow or get up on ladders, so we're constantly having to tell him no and anger him. 

It feels like the things that would make him happy, he either can't do or takes too far, and I feel like taking away these hobbies and small moments of happiness isn't caring for him but just making him a shell of a person by secluding him away in the house. He can do smaller tasks and we try to get him to, but he won't do them because he's so pissed about the big things he can't do. It also feels like with all of his health problems we're constantly either neglecting one or aren't able to properly care for it due to other medical problems. Or his stubbornness is making medical problems worse. 

It feels like some days doing the caring for him makes him uncomfortable, anxious, or pissed off. It also feels like caring for him is taking away things that make him happy. And it all just feels like a big mess with no clear end goal.","The goal is to land the plane smoothly. Not to deprive the pilot of sleep or risk running out of gas so it can go farther, not to rip off pieces of the plane so that it can go farther, ideally not to do a crash landing.

IMO, let him enjoy the last few pleasures he has in life so long as they aren’t harming others. Let him eat junk food, smoke cigarettes outdoors, and do puzzles. I wouldn’t want to live in prison either.

My grandmother had only been in her mid-stage dementia about a year before she broke her hip and it accelerated her to end-stage, and she died about five months later. Honestly I am grateful to her for it because the bitter end was comparatively short, and now we can move on. People can “live” in nursing homes unable to even scratch an itchy spot or fix a wedgie FOR YEARS.
For me, I try to focus on quality of life over quantity of life.  Having them live longer in misery offers no real benefit.  I'd look for what accommodations can be made that may allow him to do the things he loves safely.  Perhaps a puzzle table [like this one](https://www.bitsandpieces.com/product/adjustable-puzzle-tableau?p=0939377&gclid=Cj0KCQjw06OTBhC_ARIsAAU1yOXa_9WWc-qwfxXzWRDUbv86s9HnRT7JPWUdqKY-Nm0vQdA7ZFTXvGkaApzxEALw_wcB).  Also, maybe you could build him a [stand up garden table](https://bestchoiceproducts.com/products/elevated-wood-garden-planter-stand-raised-kit-grow-gardening-bcp?variant=39152530830&gclid=Cj0KCQjw06OTBhC_ARIsAAU1yOVJL1FV11_9DZ8cNIe732BcFIhAqbgNcZnfR4_jyHgrucsMtsZ4mO4aAjZ_EALw_wcB).  I can't think of any way for him to do ladders safely but allowing him to mow a small patch of ground while supervised may work.
I'm sorry OP, it's very difficult to balance everything. 

Many people here have said that it's about giving him good quality of life, and I absolutely agree.  I think that sticking point for some of us is that allowing our loved ones the things that improve their quality of life *also makes it harder for us to care for them.* 

So, it's a balancing act.  You're doing your best, hang in there.  Do what works well for BOTH your quality of life and his,
The only goal you can succeed with is to make the person as comfortable and happy as possible *in this very moment* and then adapt to the next moment, and the moment after that, and the moment after that.

He knows something is wrong. He is frustrated. And he is only going to get worse. There's nothing to learn here. There's no planning you can do to make it easier on you or him. The dementia will manifest itself differently every single day, and all you can do is roll with it.

Because all he has is NOW. This very moment. He can't plan. He can't remember (much). He is living entirely in the present moment, and if that moment is unsatisfying or frustrating, that's all he has.

Why not let him do the puzzles he enjoys? Because it is ""bad for his back"". But what does that mean? He won't live as long? He won't be as comfortable in the future?

None of that matters because he can't envision the future. All he has is now - this moment - and his desire to do a puzzle, which he is being denied because... of a future he cannot conceive of.

My dad isn't there yet. But he will be. The dementia journey is the same road for everyone, traveled at different speeds. I just hope that when my dad is in the state your grandpa is, that I can find the energy to continually keep this in mind, and make every moment as good as it can be.

Big hugs. None of this is easy or going to get easier. Thank you for sharing...
Sometimes in my darkest hours I think ""why do we keep the body healthy only for the mind to be slowly destroyed?"" it just feels like in a way we are prolonging their suffering by making sure that they are healthy. I know it sounds dark but that's how my mind thinks trapped in this situation. Unfortunately there is no other answer really. We just have to watch everything unfold.
My dad is in end stage dementia.   His behavior can change from minute to minute.   I've learned to let him do what he wants to do so long as it's not too dangerous.  
  I was very reluctant to let him buy a scroll saw, but we did get him one.  He used it twice then broke the blade.  He now has ABSOLUTELY  no interest in it.
  Scared the hell out of me when he came up on the roof with me, but he felt useful and, to my surprise, was very careful. 
  Let him mow a small part of the lawn and do the puzzle.
Unfortunately you’re not always going to be the ‘good guy’ when you’re a caregiver. The first time my grandmother slapped me in the face bc I had to change her depends shocked me, but you realize it’s just the disease. You’re doing a great job, even if you don’t see a clear objective being fulfilled",2022-04-27 14:18:48,oregonredhead,uda3n0
Dementia,Having dreams about harming mother,"My mother (63) was diagnosed in December 2021. The process started to get my mother transitioned to the Medicaid long-term care plan and eventually have a home aide for 3.5 hours a day, she will also be able to go to daycare. The process is so draining and takes time, she would also have to change her PCP and dementia specializing neurologist. I (F/24) just found a letter stating she owes Social security $2k  because she made too much money the year she decided to retire. I talked to her about this at night and she said she never decided to retire and has no idea what I'm talking about. My mother and I bicker because I hate being asked the same question again and as a result, I answer with an attitude, she then tells me to not speak to her that way and I stand my ground, she eventually says she wants to move out and I repeat that I'm the breadwinner and the only way she'll be able to move is if I fund it, she then remains quiet. 

I am just so tired. I am an only child with no father in my life and no family around. I am truly alone. I feel like my 20's are being stolen from me. I have dreams about beating my mother up and being the reason why she won't exist anymore. I wake up questioning if the dreams are real and if I'll ever be capable of doing such things. I hate those thoughts so much. My mother and I were never close emotionally and never bonded but it still pains me to think that I could probably receive a call one day hearing about her passing and be overjoyed. I think about abandoning her so often it hurts but I can't yet because I have to financially support her.","You might look into what residential options are available and see if any of them are affordable.  Frankly, many of us are relieved when our affected loved ones pass, even if they are devotedly loved.  It's not a kind disease.  Having a difficult relationship with our affected relative only makes it 10X harder.
You are under a lot of stress, very understandable. Counseling may be helpful to give you tools to deal with this stress. You may also want ot reach out to your local Health and Welfare to see if she is eligible for any types of benefits/ respite.",2022-04-27 12:45:04,x3vicky,ud7zd6
Dementia,Mom Has Dementia and Cataracts,Mom has stage 5 dementia and cataracts. Doctor says he doesn't think it's best to do the surgery because he thinks she will mess with her incision or not do well with a patch. He changed her glasses script and told me to bring her  back in a year. It was an ordeal to get her there. Has anyone's family member with dementia done well with cataract surgery? I don't want her vision to get worse; as it will affect the dementia and add to the confusion I'm sure.,"This question will sound horrible (or alt least sound horrible to those who aren’t caregivers).  How old is she?  If she messes with her eyes and blinds herself will she be blinded for the rest of her life that may be 5 years or more, or if you don’t do the surgery will she slowly lose sight, but that progression could take 10 years?

Anesthesia can also impact her state of mind permanently, I’d talk to the neurologist/geriatric provider about that as well.  Or consult with a palliative care provider.

Sadly our culture has us programmed to think we must fix every medial issue with pills or surgery, and not to is cruel. I truly believe that at a certain stage it becomes cruel to put our loved ones through these procedures.

I wish you peace whatever you decide.
There was a recent study that showed cataract surgery lowered dementia risk, so it does seem to worthwhile to try to get done, depending on your mom's condition. Here's the article that I saw https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/study-cataract-surgery-linked-lessened-dementia-risk

Your mom's physician is correct to bring up concerns about her messing with her incisions, however. How far along is her dementia? If she's at the point where surgery would do more harm than good, I would listen to her doctor.
The surgery and recovery went well, but I don’t know if she was in stage 5 yet.  Very much in stage 4 at the least.  Was showing signs of stage 6, but those symptoms might have other family drama causes.

One warning though, the “Denial of Symptoms” part of stage 5 was in full force with my relative.  After their cataracts were fixed it didn’t mean she could mentally process everything she was seeing.  I stealth tested her off and on for a while and her vision was fine.

What my relative would do is attempt to blame every time she misidentified a person, couldn’t remember a word she was reading, etc. on her eyes not working.  Until we caught on (we were still giving her a lot of the benefit of the doubt) we wondered if the cataract surgery actually improved things.  

If you do go through with it, keep in mind you might be dealing with similar for a while.
My MIL had cataract surgery shortly after she was diagnosed, probably stage 3 to 4. Absolutely impossible to have her do the post op care on her own. She either ""just put the drops in"" and of course, hadn't put them in at all or used half a bottle of eye drops in a day. So unless someone is there to administer all post op care, if it were me I would not have the surgery done. But, I would listen to your gut and take the advice of the doctor.
My mom had surgery then got a drop in eye pressure causing a stroke in her eye. After going to monthly visits where they stuck a needle in her eye then drained fluid off her optic nerve she completely lost the vision in that eye. In Hindsight I would not have the fluid drain but the (each appointment was 3.5 hr wait) cataract surgery I would have done. My mother was allergic to the antibiotic eye drops (cipro) which set off the chain of effects. Be sure the eye surgeon knows their stuff because there are not enough geriatric certified doctors. The attitude is “she isn’t going to live much longer anyway” and it pisses me off. 😡
If she can sit still and follow post op procedures.
I can't comment in regards to the procedure itself however her ability to tolerate the installation of eye drops for several weeks post procedure will factor in as well.  Do you think she will respond positively to the instillation of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops etc. 2-4 times a day following the surgery?",2022-04-27 11:56:52,beepbop21,ud6v6z
Dementia,Elder Abuse and NoK rights,"My mom is stage 5/6 alz. I’m her only daughter. She’s a covert narcissist and I have ADHD. She’s always relied on my struggles with ADHD to fit her narrative about how hard her life has been just being my mother. I’ve always rejected the manipulation with avoidance and dissociation. This has translated to my mom telling everyone that I dont like her and dont want to be around her and she cant rely on me to be there for her when she needs care, which she knows is bullshit because I have told her repeatedly that just because she cant live in my house doesnt mean I wont take care of her. She does this as a ploy for sympathy and a way to keep me isolated so that I can focus only on her. Im almost 100% that narcissism is directly linked to dementia so Im sure some of you can relate. Anyways - now her pity party stories and manipulation tactics have created real consequences and I’m at my wits end waiting for APS and my lawyer to move with a purpose. 

My moms husband of 20 years passed in early feb and left her with his sister. He had late stage COPD but he ultimately died of COVID after his sister gave it to him when they drove down to get my parents without telling anyone the day after Christmas. 

Before he died, I had never met or seen this woman. She decided they should move to her house last September and I found out bc I just happened upon a facebook post. A month later they decided to stay and again, I was notified with the rest of the world via facebook. I tried to talk to my stepdad multiple times about including me and keeping me informed in their decisions and what is going on and he apologized and said he would. 

Then two days after Xmas their hospice nurse called saying that she was at their house for their appt and their car was gone and their door was padlocked. No one could get ahold of them until we said we were going to call the police and then 2 minutes later the phone rings and they tell us they moved. 

I couldnt make a trip until early feb and by that time, my stepdad had passed and they had given all the legal everything to his sister. 

Since they moved to her house, she has been a nightmare. She wont give me phone numbers and addresses. She refuses to discuss any of my moms finances with me. They decided to put her in a home, found a place, paid for it, and had a move in date before they ever told me anything at all. She’s been making my mom travel every week and stay with different people and when it was my turn, she sent her away with me with no atm card and no ID. My mom has been having regular anxiety attacks when she forced to sleep in all these weird places and this lady just blows it off. 

I told her that I wanted to move my mom to a place closer to me and asked to discuss all my moms money and she said she wasnt comfortable discussing my moms finances with anyone. 

She wont show me any docs. She wont tell me whats going on with moms money. She has control of my mom and stepdads house. And now she wont give me my moms new phone number in her new facility - its a private number and the facility says they cant give it out. 

So I called Adult Protective Services and now they’re going to investigate. Im waiting for a lawyer to call me back. But these coupe of days where I’m not able to check on my mom and this woman could be doing or saying anything to smear me, I feel sick to my stomach. 

How can people do this to their kids?!?! These two dont even like each other and it feels like Im just the scapegoat for both of them. I love my mom and I never could have imagined that she would just write her life over to a virtual stranger that she doesnt trust or like just to spite me because I said she cant live in my house. I will NEVER do that to my kids. 

I feel horrible, conflicted, angry, disappointed, disrespected, sad. Im just deflated and confused because all I ever wanted was for my mom to love me- and she just cant.","I'm so sorry - it sounds like you're doing the right thing.  My mom is a narc with dementia as well.  She always loved to play the martyr.  Loved to put on a show about how she's was the perfect wife, mom & daughter, all while scapegoating me behind the scenes.  I swear that once I became a teen she was secretly hoping for me to either become a drug addict and/or get pregnant so she could have the attention.  I did read a couple articles that seemed to indicate that the way narcs twist reality contributes to the dementia, because the brain is wired to perceive reality, and by twisting it to make it fit in their own view, it damages parts of the brain.  Dementia doesn't run in either my maternal or fraternal sides of the family, so that is really the only explanation that makes sense.  My MIL has Alzheimer's - her father also had it, so there is a connection there.
I'm so sorry.  You're doing the right thing for your mother, to get her help, but this is out of the goodness of your own heart.  From what you're saying she doesn't deserve your help, but you're going to give it anyway.  I think that's the best way to look at it and keep your sanity.  You're not a bad daughter, you never were.  Don't let your ADHD trick you into feeling guilty or responsible.  Take care of yourself here.",2022-04-27 09:30:56,kellyfresh,ud3n42
Dementia,Dementia Careblazers,,,2022-04-27 05:04:17,Throwaway_grlacct,ucz829
Dementia,I’m 18 and I’ve given myself dementia.,"I have just been told this and it’s now so apparent. I hated my life and wanted to die so bad, but I couldn’t find a way I felt comfortable ending myself with. I would’ve done something like an opioid but I never had a place to get it, so I chose diphenhydramine. I poisoned myself everyday with usually around a gram of diphenhydramine for if my memory is correct about 7 months. I thought it would kill me quickly, like with cardiac arrest or something. It became apparent to everyone around me that I wasn’t going to die from a heart attack or seizure, but that I was declining mentally instead, and fast. I was so isolated during my use due to laying in bed all day I never noticed too much impairment aside from forgetting things a lot. Since almost everyday I have some sort of mental breakdown about how I’m not doing enough with my life, I tried to get out again and put in an effort to function like everyone else. That’s when it became apparent. My voice was so frail and timid, and I could never find the words I was looking for or would just completely forget what we were talking about, and completely freeze up like a classic Alzheimer’s patient. The most scary thing is I will be walking sometimes and before I know it I’m in a completely different place with no memory of getting there, it’s an absolutely terrifying realization. My mom has seen these effects and it’s become apparent to me that I have managed to kill myself, but this will be a slow and agonizing death for me and everyone who cares about me. I am so terrified. I don’t want to die anymore, and especially put my poor family through this. The doctors say I have given myself drug induced dementia from DPH addiction, and I am so scared that I may have just lost my life. I will be on acetylcholinasterase inhibitors very shortly.","Hmm. Everything I've been reading mainly talks about its usage in elderly dementia patients. Some studies suggest a return of cognitive function once the drug is stopped.
I think I'd seek a second opinion.
I am sorry you are going through this. Life is about mindset. My dementia patients life happy lives and you can still do so much.
Wow, I'm so sorry you felt like this was your only choice.  Don't focus on guilt, focus on getting well.  Work with your doctor to find the source of your pain so that you can heal from it.  I'm hoping so hard for you right now, sending you positive waves.  You can do this.
It may take a while but especially considering your age, there’s hope that you will regain your mental faculties with avoiding further intake of 1st gen (maybe avoid 2nd gen too) antihistamines. They have use in medicine but are poison when overdone like you seem to have in your case. Just adopt healthy dietary habits for nutrients for regeneration and the more healthy of lifestyle overall one could assume the better. It will likely take time but stay the course. If memory is as crippling of an issue as you say this may be an obstacle in reforming your behavior so take measures to ensure that you won’t just space out and forget that you’re being healthy now. Best of luck
Omg gosh mate well that sucks, what do your therapists / counsellors say?   Sorry you feel so badly about your life, that's sad.    Is there any chance you can go to a rehab facility?    Sounds like you might need some pretty intensive therapy right?    If you're going to college, there must be some support groups around that you could join, as well?   Like ptsd support groups, depression anxiety dark thoughts... Bloody hell taking  acetylcholinasterase inhibitors at 18yrs old, you need to get yrself off all these shite pharmaceuticals before yr adult life has even started, stop using bandaids to try patch over problems that are not being addressed at the source - go therapy!!    Best of luck!
“Dementia” as the doctors are using it, is a cluster of symptoms. it does not mean you have Alzheimer’s or another neurodegenerative disease. 

Have you gotten any kind of brain scan? MRI, CT? They should be checking for hydrocephalus and tumors etc before handing you a terminal diagnosis. Those are usually FIXABLE.
I've been using diphenhydramine nearly every night for the last 5 years (age 25) in order to sleep and started developing a lot of bizzare thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Been experiencing symptoms of drug induced dementia for years without any clue as to why until recently. I relate entirely to the frail and timid voice, I often felt that I talked like a scared little boy as if my sense of identity and intellectual capacity was just gone and it made me incredibly insecure. The doctor told me to expect a 3-6 month recovery period; I'm 6 weeks into withdrawal, the first 2 weeks was the worst and although my mental function has improved significantly, I definately have more recovery ahead of me for sure.

To clarify, not all dementia is neurodegenerative/permanent. Reversible dementias are real, diphenhydramine blocks acetylcholine in the brain which is what causes the cognitive decline over time. ""Reversible dementias"" can happen to anybody, there's a lot of confusion about the terminology though",2022-04-27 03:35:05,dabgmaer13,ucy230
Dementia,Interesting post on agitation of yr loved one,"I thought perhaps this form might help some folk with communicating their LO condition to doctors / medical / care industry staff  -- from Fb page < Dementia : The Journey Ahead >

While we were searching for an accurate diagnosis in the late 90's, our family practitioner attempted to treat my husband’s agitation and behavioral issues with a drug called Ativan. Ativan, which goes by the generic name of Lorazepam, is an anti-anxiety drug used for the management of anxiety disorders associated with depression. Our physician was not aware that many dementia patients have an unfavorable response when given this medication. For this reason, avoid medications such as Valium, Xanax, and Ativan if you suspect Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD), as they may create more problems than they solve.My warning does not apply to all dementia patients.Dishonesty (fiblets) and distraction has its rewards when caring for a dementia patient; namely, reducing patient agitation and caregiver stress.If you are experiencing agitation problems with your loved one please fill out the agitation inventory sheet below and give it to your loved ones physician. Please deal with this problem before it gets out of hand and someone gets hurt...it can and does happen... more than you realise.

Dementia,Can dementia caregiving cause PTSD?,"I ask because, months after my dad's death and almost a year after I put him in memory care, I'm still having a lot of issues.

For example: I have trouble sleeping at night. I snap awake at every sound, everything suddenly on high alert. I never used to, but then dad stopped sleeping at night and started getting up to shenanigans. (He tended to destroy things. Or try to bolt into the night because the FBI were after him. Or whatever.)

My temper is also frayed. I'm burned out. I have no patience. I also can't seem to stop reliving what went on. I walk into the house and I almost see him again. I have trouble going into the room that was his bedroom, because it brings back all kinds of unpleasant memories.

I do try to remember better times, but the total insanity of dementia overshadows it all. I am in therapy, but it doesn't seem to be helping a lot, because the thoughts/flashbacks/insomnia are all still there.

But I always thought of PTSD being a thing you suffer after being in war, or suffering attempted murder. Like, serious trauma. Not from caregiving, which is traumatic in little ways but nothing like listening to bombs fall on your neighbor.

So, has anyone had any experience of this? If so, what did you do? I've been drinking more than is good for me just to drown all of these thoughts out, and I really need a better solution.","I can’t answer this but I read a report a while ago about the health consequences of being a carer.

From memory, carers apparently tend to develop health issues after the death of the caree, and as a result carers have on average shorter life spans.

I have been my mother’s sole fulltime carer for the past 3 years, and her dementia is what disturbs me the most.

She no longer knows I am her son. She just calls me ‘mamma’. This hurts so much now, but I expect it will hurt much more once she is gone.
Yes, yes, absolutely. You are not alone. Caregiver PTSD has its own category, and is very common among those caring for very ill loved ones and patients.

Is there any way to talk to a counsellor or therapist? Even just talking to someone who will listen can help alleviate some pressure. Journaling and writing things down can also help. Communities like this one have also helped to just commiserate with people who have been through the same thing. In-person support groups can also help considerably.

Just know you're not the only one going through this.
My heart. I’m still in the thick of my caregiving journey, but fuck, I am so broken. So so broken. I think everyday about what I feel is irreparable damage to my heart and soul having to go through this with my mother. And I’m alone. I’m two months away from turning 32. She’ll be 65 in four months. 

I have a couple of people who are trying to help me get her out of my home, and she’s on hospice (but they are short-staffed, so we still have not yet had an aide come help do things like shower her, and she’s not necessarily close to dying, but that’s another story for another day), but the damage has been done and it’s just been a year. I am traumatized. 

I’m not currently in therapy, but I still participate in a weekly support group, of which, I am the youngest attendant. I otherwise ended things with the counselor I was talking to, because all of the calls felt like they were venting sessions and I wasn’t being asked questions or given suggestions of how to manage my stress/emotions. I need help examining my trauma and my behavior/emotions. So I think I need to have a reevaluation done to see if I can be referred to a higher level of therapist. 

I also need to have a physical. I have concerns that I know need to be addressed, but as comes with being the sole caregiver with no one to rely on, that means I need to take time off of work while she’s at daycare to make an appointment, or I need to hire a caregiver to come watch her. Either way, I’m losing money just to try to have my health checked. I guess that’s not as bad as losing my life. 

I feel like my lifespan has been shortened and that I will never be happy again. At least not the way I was before this. I’m starting to really understand that the old me is gone, and now I’m grieving myself in addition to my mother, who is still right in front of me. Sucking my life away as her brain dies. She doesn’t even know who I am. I’m mom. It’s all so fucked. I can’t believe this got so bad so fast for us. I am spinning in a daze constantly and frozen all at the same time. I feel robbed and cheated.
So much said here that resonates with me.  My wife--LBD--just went into memory care.  I was her primary caregiver for the four years before that.  So stressful.  I had help but still terrible.  And then to watch her decline in the grip of this terrible condition.  

Now in memory care I visit it her several times a week (it's just a 20-minute drive away).  She's so confused.  Motor skills have also declined. She used to love to walk.  Now the caregiver and I have to get her up from her chair and support her on either side as she walks a bit outside.  She is not agitated--that's good.  Really pretty calm.  Saying things to herself but not much I say registers with her.  Recognizes me on some level, I guess--we sit, I hold her hand, she sometimes squeezes mine.  But we can't really have a conversation.  It's not the facility's fault--she's been there only five weeks----I saw all this decline well underway when she was at home.  Just thankful she doesn't seem scared or angry.  But it's still so sad to see.  And I'm very worried that my wife will continue to decline even from this low level. Not something I want to dwell on but it's hard not to.

Then I go home and I'm all alone.  And of course surrounded by so much that reminds me of her in this house we lived in for 30 years.  There's a step-daughter (my wife's daughter) and she's really sweet and supportive.  She's been really wonderful. But she lives 350 miles away.  I have friends and they've been supportive too.  But I feel very alone. I think about all the things we used to do together--which was just about everything.  Heck, just sitting in front of the TV watching something we liked (or loved to hate) and making random comments to each other while holding hands.  And now it's very quiet here.

In other words, there's stress--a different kind of stress--even though I'm not the primary caregiver anymore.  And she's in a good facility.  But there's stress and sadness and loneliness.  And insomnia too, for sure. I've started seeing a therapist.  Just two sessions.  I like him.  I think it will help, or hope so.

Whether it's technically PTSD or not, the fallout from a situation like yours (and mine) is very real. I agree you should talk to someone.  Find a good therapist--sounds like the one you are seeing isn't much help.  Maybe your GP can recommend one. Maybe get involved in new activities through your church or some organization.  Sign up at a gym.  Join one of those groups at [meetup.com](https://meetup.com).  And I would guess that the passage of time will help.  You are probably fairly young so you have that going for you.  I wish you comfort.
Yes, sure.  I feel for you!  I've been caring for my mum for years now, I have various multiple mental health issues stemming from the whole story - I guess when she passes or enters facility my mental health issues won't disappear overnight.  So sorry for your loss, it's sad,  but great that yre in therapy, good on you!    therapy helps

Idk, can't you completely change his old room, so at least it looks / feels different?  Sometimes cosmetic / visual changes can provide enormous help in changing our feelings of something.  Heck, go for gold & change most of the house decor, even.  Give it a refresh.  If budget is a consideration, even just going thrift shopping for some pictures, or wall-hangings, different curtains, different dishes / cutlery / towels / bed covers / whatever ... Donate yours & buy others lol.. 

Can you join some local hobby clubs or something?   I never would have thought in a milion years but I chanced onto a lindy-hop swing dance group on fb who meet up weekly not far from me, in a community hall.  Served a few different purposes - got my mind of obsessing, exercise, fun exercise to music, contact with other people, made a few new friends, some of us meet up weekends to practise dance in a park, have mini-picnic...  

I found that getting active in doing anything - even lone walks along the beach / forest, exchanging hellos & greeting peoples passing doggos, exchange a few words with passing hikers... Do some self-directed art therapy, get a sketch book & draw silly cartoon characters in my very badly drawn forest scenes haha, write little X-rated swear words coming out of their mouths hahaa it's therapeutic... 

Yeh, best of luck!
Mom’s been gone since late fall, and I still panic when the phone rings.  She was in Memory Care and I frequently got calls about agitation, combativeness, med change requests, falls, in 2020 - Covid cases (then an 18 month lockdown), etc.  I lived an hour away with a horrible commute (traffic).  The day she died, I of course jumped in my car to be with her in her last moments and traffic was a cluster fuck even at 10 am.  I could barely see because I was crying and praying she’d hang on (she did and my sibs and I were by her side), and cussing like a sailor at the gridlock.  The hospice workers kept calling me to make sure I was coming. So every time the phone rings I still panic a little.
I'm absolutely sure it can. Lots of us are on a pretty constant high alert to make sure our loved one isn't doing something dangerous or trying to leave the house. It gets exhausting and every sound makes you hop up to check. Like a bad horror movie, we are the ones that have to go investigate the noise. 

For the house-
Maybe consider painting the room? Sometimes stripping everything out and starting over can change everything about the room. Prominently display things that bring positive memories (either of him or just good memories for you).

Unfortunately we are left in the space after they depart and have to make the best of it. Kind of like breaking an ugly glass and turning it into a mosaic you actually love. Take the good, throw away the bad. It takes time, but hopefully we all get something pretty in the end.
I’ve not personally experienced this (I’m lucky as far as caregiving goes). I can absolutely see it happening 

It sounds like so many things about the house are triggers… Have you considered   moving, is that at all a possibility/realistic/something you would do?

Edit: even if you can’t move (or don’t want to, or don’t know how to feel about that), I would strongly recommend a change of scene, even temporarily. Like take a couple of weeks and go to a cabin or beach somewhere. Or a yoga retreat. Or [WWOOF](https://wwoof.net/). (If Brazil has ever appealed, I know of a great place.)
Yes, it’s a thing. if it’s financially feasible, I suggest getting rid of random items around your home that are triggers and replacing, ideally doing some remodel or at least re-painting the walls. Even change your cell phone’s lock screen and ring tone. Your own bedroom is probably triggering too since you had so many sleepless nights. Get new sheets, blankets, and pillowcases. 

some mundane objects likely to create triggers: the curtains, big pieces of art on the walls, his shoes, alarm clock, rugs, his blankets and bedsheets, shower curtain; lampshades, anything that takes up a lot of visual real estate and can be gotten rid of or replaced. Even rearranging your furniture inside a room can help.

My grandmother died in home hospice in March. I find classical music and early 1950s music as triggers because they were playing for her 24/7 to keep her calm. We are still emptying her apartment. It’s almost like memory laundering. A lot of very mundane yet useful items have trauma attached to them when in that space, so we are giving away on Buy Nothing. It took about a month before we could spend substantial time in the bedroom where she died and not just walk past quickly. Immediately gave away medical equipment, diaper pail, incontinence supplies, wheelchair and walkers. A few weeks ago I opened the window and started playing some late 1960s music. The kind that a hippy’s parents would really hate lol. Still dealing with the random every day items. Went through her shoes today. We haven’t even touched the china etc yet. As soon as the big furniture (which was promised to her kids who have yet to show up) is taken out we will repaint the walls a new color.
Damn. All of our stories are different, yet the same. Tack on a global pandemic and best of luck.

It's still too soon for me, but I find distraction works really well. I also use this tactic for my mom; my parents were married 55 years and were really close, and my mom - mentally ill and legally blind - insisted on caring for my dad herself. I've gotten her involved in some planning for me, and it's a simple little thing that gets her out of the house and makes her feel useful.

So, as you can see, OP, it's real, and IMO worse over the last couple of years.
Yep, for me any sounds of a ringing phone send my heart beating into a frenzy. Whether it’s someone’s phone ringing on tv, my own or the sound of any ringtone. This is due to my grandfather constantly calling and me never knowing what to expect especially if he just wants to hurl insults. Also he tended to go to the hospital for no reason so I would always get random calls from the ER to pick him up. But yea if I could never hear another phone I’d be fine. I have insomnia and it’s interesting you mention sounds. Last night while laying in bed the sound of the heater coming on had me jumping and my heart speeding up. I intend to see someone about this maybe get on some anxiety meds or something while continuing to help him.
When you feel your world is flipped upside down and you are not in control that is bonafide trauma. What you are feeling is very common especially for dementia caretakers. Sometimes sharing with a group of other caregivers can help level out the burden of carrying the weight of the trauma and sometimes the feelings related to placing a loved one in residential care. Also finding an activity to redirect the energy once focused on caregiving i.e. yoga, meditation, reiki (chakra alignment),  knitting, reading, walking, art of any kind, or puzzles. Basically anything that requires both mind and body will help level out some of triggers. Long walks with an audiobook were key to exhaust my mind and body and eventually picked up my camera and started to enjoy nature photography. It was a climb to get over the first year but definitely helped with the transition.

I’m in almost the same situation.

My dad died suddenly a couple months ago.  He and I were caregivers for my mom.

I placed Mom into an assisted living facility, and have similar issues that you do: trouble sleeping because I’m listening for her movements; looking around the house and seeing things that remind me of my parents; feeling lost and alone in a house built for a family.

My brother doesn’t understand; he just thinks I’m missing my mom (which I am, in a weird way), and that I’ll be fine in a few weeks.  

I’m trying therapy, but I’m guessing it’s going to be a long, hard road, no matter what.
Yes, seconding that you're not alone!

One thing to try may appear counter-intuitive for how burned out you are - finding/refocusing on ways and roles where you can recognize yourself as contributing or creating may have a healing effect for you as I think it does for me. I think this can happen in many different ways, and balance is important! Paying attention to Maslow's hierarchy has been helpful for me, it's like a handy checklist.
I would say yes. my therapist feels my previous marriage caused my CPTSD, assisting to care for my stepson (disabled adult)  continues it. PTSD has to do with any life experience that places you in a heightened state of anxiety for long periods of time. Your body never relaxes and you're always on alert. Being a 24/7 caregiver qualifies. You didn't even get the luxury of sleep being a respite. Hopefully it fades in time, but I'd definitely keep up with therapy.
PTSD is far more complex than the war scenario. Reading your symptoms you probably have complex ptsd which is akin to Chinese water torture, it’s a slow drip of trauma over a longer time than say almost getting run over or being shot at etc

I had ptsd through a series of traumatic events and two life threatening periods in icu and then my Dad having terminal cancer and my Mum has Alzheimer’s. 

I empathise it’s awful. 

In short CBT based therapy is licenced gaslighting aka it’s your fault you are thinking it wrong. You need EMDR 

I had it for both dying in icu stints and it worked well. I need more but mental health support is just plain screwed due to covid backlogs etc
My mother has been gone 2 years my father and husband 2 years prior. I took care of all 3. I am seeing a neurologist for peripheral neuropathy so I brought up the issues I am having with unhappiness and inability to sleep. I feel like I have been through a war. My mental state is very raw. I see people pick up and remarry after a year. How? It makes no sense. I would suggest a visit to your doctor to give you a referral to a mental health professional. You need an understanding ear to listen 
😉 good luck!
> Like, serious trauma. Not from caregiving, which is traumatic in little ways but nothing like listening to bombs fall on your neighbor.

It's absolutely serious trauma. Watching my sweet, caring mom turn into a babbling, angry, paranoid, confused monster is one of my worst nightmares, and I have had to witness it daily for over a year now.
I feel like majority of people always relate PTSD to war but in reality you can get PTSD from any type of trauma.. I would think caregiving is no different as it is extremely traumatic.. 
I'm 27 and have been a caregiver for my 63 year old mother for 3 years now. She is in the later stages and her decline is so rapid it's terrifying. She no longer knows who I am and lately has been getting extremely combative, aggressive, and violent with me. Even after losing my father at 8 years old to cancer, I still say being my moms caregiver will be the most traumatic thing I will ever endure. I've always struggled with anxiety and depression but I'm having a way harder time managing it lately. Even with my mom here, I feel like I have PTSD. My anxiety has been so much worse around her, as I'm not sure how severe she is going to react to things.. she screams and cries for hours on end. I swear I still hear her screams, even when she's asleep. Weird, but I know that is really common for new mothers as well... And to think it's only going to get worst after she passes 😭😭😭😭😭 that's fucking horrendous. It's modern day torture for everyone involved. I probably wasn't much insight but I'm sending so much love and peace your way
Middle of the night waking and temper are signs of low serotonin.  I'm on Lexapro and it's helping.
Every minute of every day. I know it’s ptsd. It suck’s. I’m six months out and it doesn’t let up. Worst part is I have a fantastic support system and beautiful people in my life and can’t let it go. Good luck to you.
Trauma can be brought on by many situations, aside from war, violence or assault and the trauma from being a caregiver, as you relate, can be just as damaging.  Living under constant stress and vigilance never allows your brain or body to de-stress.  Abusive behavior and/or gaslighting from the afflicted person wears you down, leaving you angry, exhausted and feeling hopeless. And even when the person passes, you keep reliving the experiences, just like soldiers with PTSD, as well as constantly feeling the loss of that person.",2022-04-26 21:20:34,microbewhisperer,ucrwd2
Dementia,My Mom is finally seeing a specialist today,"A bit of background, I went low contact with my mom in 2017 because she was becoming more and more toxic to be around. She was always complaining about my dad and was rude about both my and my brother's relationships. I saw her on holidays and birthdays and that was about it. At the time I had no idea it was the beginning of dementia. It never even crossed my mind.  


In 2019 I figured out that it was likely early onset dementia and told my dad to get her seen. I told my mom to go get seen. And they didn't do anything. In early December her mental state dropped off a cliff. She left the house and called my brother because there was a strange man in her house. It was my Dad.    


She's isolating herself more and more and when we go over, it's like there's a wall in front of her. Her personality is just flat. My husband and I had our first baby, her first grandchild, a few months ago. She acts like she barely cares. And it makes me so angry because if she had gotten seen 3 years ago, they could have possibly slowed the decline.   


My mom was so excited for grandkids. And honestly, the woman who has met my baby isn't her. She never recognizes my Dad anymore, even though she recognizes everyone else including the baby. The past few days she hasn't been eating and hasn't even turned on the TV which is extremely strange for her.   


I feel like we're in the late stage, and we don't even have a formal diagnosis yet. I don't know what the specialist is going to do, but I feel like now, it's too little, too late.  


*edited for clarity and readability*","Depending on the type and the cause, it might not have made a difference if she was diagnosed years ago.  

We often hear that medications can delay progression of dementia, but much of the research shows that it has little to no effect.  Here is one example:  [https://www.aafp.org/afp/2018/0815/p248a.html](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2018/0815/p248a.html)   

I'm not saying that drugs are never helpful, but I am saying that the odds that they would have substantially delayed the progression over 5 years are low.
One of the hardest things to do is parent a parent. And no one wants to go to the doctor and be told they have dementia.
And it's sadly usually a big event like that that makes finding care urgent, and it's tough to make those decisions on the fly.
Try to remember, this is a disease. She cannot help herself. Is she having hallucinations?
I am so sorry you are going through this and have so many emotions.  The fact is even if she was diagnosed at an earlier stage it would have likely made any difference.  Medication can help with some symptoms but there isn't anything that would actually slow the progression.  As hard as it is to do you have to know that her behavior is out of her control.  There are days when my husband seems to be just floating around because he can't understand anything that is going on.  Having a ""flat"" effect is also part of dementia as is seemingly not caring about what is going on.  This disease is so hard, to watch someone you love change and get lost in the disease, is heart wrenching.  Love her as best you can and remember she is still in there somewhere.
Sounds like you are in the mid stages versus the late stages. Glad she finally got help but might I suggest anti-depressants for your mom? It worked wonders on mine. I used to fight tooth and nail about things, now she is super mellow, and while not the mom I remember, much better than what she was before.
My father was diagnosed in 2015, never saw a specialist.  A general practioner prescribed meds for agitation, sleep, and anxiety. He had no aide, no adult day program.  He passed in 2021.

My uncle by marriage, his brother-in-law, was diagnosed probably in 2017 or 2018. He saw a specialist. He took the specialist prescribed meds.  He had an aide. He went to adult day programs.  My uncle died a few months after my dad.  

My uncle wasn't talking and zoned out.  Meanwhile my dad was 80% of the time talking incoherently, he would have moments of clarity. Probably up until the day he died, he remembered the names of his kids, siblings, and friends. 

Meanwhile, my aunt, my father's younger sister. My uncle's wife. She was diagnosed in 2013 or 2014. Saw a specialist and took the prescribed meds. Has an aide.  She's been in the mid stages. She is walking and talking. Feeding herself. Still remembers her kids, grandkids, and siblings.  Thankly she doesn't realize that he husband and brothers (several people in the family have had dementia) have passed on.  

Everyone's dementia is different. How everyone reacts to dementia medication is different too.  

Best of luck.
I am sorry. I agree with other’s comments. Earlier diagnosis would most like have made little difference. And , unfortunately, it will get much worse. Be gentle with her - she can’t help it, she would be horrified to see what she has come to and she is trapped in a frightening nightmare.  I am going through it with my dad.
Gosh.  People entering dementia need compassion & understanding, not told they're toxic & cut off, and the carers (your dad) need help, not just given orders or what someone else thinks they should do.  You're making judgements and assumptions there that 'she barely cares'.  Maybe she's LOST confused and embarrassed.  Idk, maybe she is toxic or whatever, so sorry for that.  Maybe you ought to access dementia org &/ alzheimers org to get educated about living with dementia, *how to actually help people experiencing losing their mind*, rather than bitch about how she doesn't appreciate your baby enough.  Sorry but, just the way your writing comes across, to me.   best of luck",2022-04-26 10:07:51,OORantar67,ucde6d
Dementia,Mom in denial about losing memory,"I’m not quite sure if this is the right sub, but I figured I’d give it a try. 
My mother is 62 years old and has never been known for her great memory, but it’s been steadily getting worse and we’re worried about early onset dementia or something similar. I recently moved for work and don’t speak to my mom as frequently as I did, so the change has been extra apparent for me. I know stuff like this can be genetic, but both of her parents died over twenty years ago so we don’t have any elder relatives to compare to. 
My brother, my sister, my father, my cousin, and I have all had conversations with each other about how to help my mom but it’s been to no avail. Every time someone has tried to bring up the topic with my mother, she gets really defensive and sometimes mean. She seems aware that it’s getting worse, making comments like “What is wrong with me?” when she can’t remember something but whenever we suggest talking to a doctor she shuts down.
I guess my question is, are there any tips for trying to talk to my mom about this and trying to get her some help? Or tips for the family so we can better understand what may be happening? I know you can’t help people if they don’t want it, but it’s so hard watching this happen especially when everyone is so hyper aware of it but we still can’t do anything.","She might be in denial because she can't see the changes that you see. More than likely, though, she is aware that she's struggling and is worried or embarrassed. Like with any other mental health issue, its much easier to be open and honest if you believe there are ways to manage the problem while keeping your independence and dignity. She might be worried that the second she admits to memory issues, people will insist she sell everything and move into a nursing home. Or that people won't respect her as much, won't think of her the same way or want to be around. Or it's depressing to accept because there are no great cures yet. 

I would strongly suggest framing it like ""if you are having trouble remembering things, or forgetting this or that specific thing is driving you nuts, other people find it helpful to....""  I think it helps to not feel like she alone has this problem and its life ending. 
Avoid monitoring her and trying to ""catch her"" forgetting things in order to prove or demonstrate to her & others that her memory is getting worse. You will only make her hide things and lie more, and it may even prevent her seeking out help or support that will extend her independence and reduce the stress she must feel. 

18% of adult over 60 have some level of age related cognitive impairment. Society needs to find ways for people to live openly with this condition without fear, shame and social isolation making it even worse. It sounds totally weird today, but people used to hide a cancer diagnosis back when there was nothing to be done about it and you just died. I think we are still that way with dementia.
My wife, 77, doesn't think there's anything wrong with her memory, though there clearly is and dementia runs in her family among all her sisters. Two died and one is in memory care but she asks me what exactly is wrong with her and I tell her, then she forgets we had that discussion and back to square one.   I'm trying to get her assessed by the NIH.  Her neurologist is indifferent and her primary is third rate.  I've argued with her doctors and they no longer respond to me.   So sad and painful to watch her decline.
start getting her affairs in order including power of attorney paperwork and living will etc. you will thank me later. get all the banking information, credit cards etc.
My mom has Parkinson’s so was already seeing a neurologist, he asked about her memory and she admitted it wasn’t great, so he talked her into doing some memory testing “just to get a baseline” which ended up in a diagnosis of mild dementia last year. I’m glad we did the testing, the report reinforced she should not be driving etc. I don’t know if your mom has even a primary care, but getting new or different symptoms checked out is always a good idea. Best wishes!
Unfortunately, I have no advice, but I'm in a similar boat. And it's getting worse every day. The kicker? My mom is the caregiver for my dad who has dementia but doesn't know he has dementia. I even sold my house and moved across the Pacific just to keep an eye on them. She says that she's mentioned memory issues to her doctor but he says she's fine, just under stress from taking care of my dad. If I push her to go back, she gets defensive or comes up with an excuse why she can't.

But today...oh, boy. I posted on FB about my dog being sick. My parents have known since it happened *last week*. We have been on the phone with them and texted updates and sent pics of our sad, sick little dog. My folks are very attached to her, and my dad even called me crying saying she was in his prayers. Been four days of constant contact about her condition. Today, my mom calls and is like, *your dad saw your FB post, why didn't you tell us Pasha was sick???*

I have no idea what to do besides try and get power of attorney or something. Will probably look through some of the resources posted in this sub. Because I'm very worried. And this was next level. Let me know if you figure out something for your mom and best of luck to you!
I lived through that for five years. Best advice I got here was how it got beyond denial to not even being able to see it, so don’t try to convince her. I was told that nothing would happen until the inevitable crisis, which finally happened a month ago and she’s now in memory care. Good luck and if you can get her to the doctors, it would be great. Just don’t expect it.
My mom was the same, something else had to trigger us bringing her to the doctor. In our case, she had dropped 20 pounds, basically starving herself on accident and the apparent weight loss was leverage to get her seen. Unfortunately that doctor we took her to was horrible and extremely unprofessional so we need a second opinion. I was able to schedule an appointment for 4 months later (coming up this monday) and I'm saying it's a referral from the other doctor to to talk about the brain to gut connection since eating and weight is an issue for her. phrasing it differently and not saying its a memory thing might help, best of luck",2022-04-26 08:47:45,Public-Explorer8295,ucbsc7
Dementia,Do you Appreciate the Significance of an early Dementia or Alzheimers Diagnosis?,"My neurologist resident friend and I have been developing an automated computer & phone adminstered dementia testing application over the past 2 years. We have entered into Beta testing of the application and are currently organizing a clinical study verifying it's accuracy.

Dementia,Entertainment?,"This sounds strange but what can I do to keep my mother entertained? She used to play bridge and go to classes and read books. She had interest in plays and events. Now she has LBD with Parkinsonism and can’t get out much. She has forgotten how to use a computer so can’t do Zoom classes. She doesn’t seem to have the patience or attention to sit through a movie, even a sitcom. What can I do to keep her entertained? She calls me 15 times a day to complain and argue. Her latest is that I told the doctor to diagnose her with dementia. I am The Antagonist in the story of her life. If there was something else that could hold her interest, maybe even bring her some pleasure, maybe she wouldn’t be so angry at me all the time?","Here's some of the stuff that keeps my mom, who has LBD, occupied and entertained: 

Adult coloring books

Any kind of art - modeling clay, watercolors, whatever

Books written specifically for adults with dementia by Emma Rose Sparrow (varying levels; all have no conflict, no ""plot"" as it were, meaning also nothing to endlessly fixate on - mom is a compulsive reader and loves them)

Various kinds of fidget toys

Fairy tale podcasts (basically it's someone reading her a fairy tale, there are some great options out there)

Endless reruns of the Great British Baking Show (because everyone is kind and the ""conflict"" is just ""can they do it"" and no one is mean)

Nature documentaries, provided they don't focus on animals that die (tougher than you'd think to find)
Nature documentaries are a big hit. if you go on the PBS app on a smart tv/roku etc there are a ton. My grandmother also enjoyed Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr on PBS. 

I also got some Benjamin Moore paint color catalogs/ photo books and we flipped through and “planned” a remodel. She didn’t believe she was at her own house but rather a fake imitation (common). Instead of trying to convince her she was home, I said “I know it doesn’t feel like home, how can we make the space feel good enough anyway for the time being?” This actually worked and she got excited about the idea of remodeling it into a new design that wasn’t trying/failing to be her home
Music from their era seems to be comfort their mood and somewhat boost lucidity
Lots of great ideas here. Check out zinniatv.com. They have free and paid content. The babies and dogs kept my mother happy. The birds and butterflies were very calming. 

My mother sorted colored index cards, folded hand towels and washcloths, sorted socks, and looked at a handful of reprinted photos from her childhood and teen years until the day prior to transitioning.
A few things, worked for my mom and now my husband: getting out of the house daily (mornings were/are easiest) even if just for a drive to the drive thru pharmacy or fast food place.

If able to, attend church services, enjoy sitting at park or in the shade watching kids play, visit baby animals at shelter, pick up a pizza and eat outdoors on a picnic table, start a potted plant garden and water daily, visit the local library, our community has music in the park in Fridays, short walk (even if just to mailbox). I scour the local newspapers, library event postings, Facebook, etc. for free no reservation events like parades, art festivals, concerts, etc and try to work in one or two a month.

Indoors- cooking bread in bread maker (help with assembling supplies, etc); invite a friend, neighbor or pastor over to visit; play music familiar to them.
Someone mentioned the adult coloring books, and I wholeheartedly agree with that.  My family member has been able to color (and interested in coloring) throughout most phases of her dementia.

While they are still able to read, newspapers and newsletters might be entertaining for them.  Many newspapers are now digital, which is a pain.  However, I was able to hunt down a few newspapers that still deliver.  Also, local community news, particularly entertainment news, is a good fit for them, because it's usually not conflictual or upsetting.  At one point, I started buying paper newspapers, pulling out the entertaining parts, and mailing them to her.  Magazines are another option.  Since you said she likes plays, maybe you could find something about theater and the arts that could be mailed to her on a regular basis.  Sometimes, making a small donation to a local arts center will result in occasional newsletters about the arts.  The New York Times is another option.",2022-04-25 23:18:54,reddit_user498,uc34d5
Dementia,hello. new here. a lot to cover in one sitting.,"my mom's health has been slowly declining for the past few years. she has end stage emphysema, microvascular disease, and dementia. but, over the last few months, it's declined *rapidly.* 

today was interesting. she's been falling increasingly more the past few months, she's gotten two black eyes and a swollen knee. she fell off the toilet and didn't say anything for hours until she finally unlocked the door to let me in and I saw. my husband and I got her off the floor and back to her room.

after about 10, 15 minutes, I went back to check on her and it seemed like she had just slid off the edge of the bed and was sat on the floor. I got my husband and as we helped her back up, she kept giggling, calling me ""Sarah."" I said no, my name is OP, I'm your daughter. she would swat my head playfully and say ""shh! stop it, my mom will hear you and find out we're loaded!"" 

this was the first incident where she didn't know who I was, and confused me with a high school friend she used to smoke weed with in the late 60s/early 70s. so, that was a lot of emotions..

anyway. we're buying some bars to install on the wall in the bathroom, one of those toilet chairs, and some handles I can install on her bed. I'm taking her to her doctor in the AM for a check up and to make sure she hasn't broken anything.

she seems to have regained some cognizance back and knows who I am again. it comes and goes in waves.

anyway, hi. I know this is a lot for a first post but damn, I just needed to let it out. my mom is my best friend and watching her fade in front of me is a bitch to deal with.","make sure you get her tested for a UTI. When there is a dramatic decline, that is frequently the culprit especially for senior women with dementia, and they often return to baseline with a course of antibiotics. 

very sorry. the whole thing massively sucks.
My dad had crazy delusions and hallucinations, but most were ridiculous, making them funny both to him and to us as well. We used that humor throughout and it really got us through to the end. Gave us a little comfort. He was always ornery, but that only seemed to become more pronounced. Luckily, he was always very upbeat and positive, and these personality traits stayed with him.",2022-04-25 22:56:33,MyMothersKeeperr,uc2ozx
Dementia,What you wish you knew...,"Hello.

To begin - whoever you are, if you are within this virtual community, I truly send you my love. This is a vile disease to navigate for all involved.

I come seeking advice. Here is some information that, while I apologize for ranting, hope helps give you the best idea possible of my family's situation...

My mother (72 years old) was diagnosed several months ago with a yet-to-be-finalized type of dementia, still in its earlier stages. My father died without warning this past June due to PE after major surgery so it's been a hectic and difficult year. I am the youngest (30) of my siblings and while they have been doing a lot, I have taken lead with her mental health and overall well-being.

Her main symptoms are mild memory issues, trouble focusing at times and she has difficulty with speech, especially when she is anxious or feels the need to ""perform"". She does not slur words nor does she ever simply stop talking - her issue is getting the words out (she expresses that it feels like the words are trapped in her mind). Once prompted or guided, she can complete her thought. This gives her a lot of anxiety.

She has no issues with balance or movement nor has she had any hallucinations or severe ""episodes"", yet. She is still pretty active (does laundry, cooks her own meals, for the most part, does work in the garden, washes her own dishes, etc) and stays relatively social. She has been taking Donepezil and began speech/cognition therapy about 12 weeks ago.

I am not sure if the speech therapy is doing a great deal but she enjoys going/likes her speech therapist. If nothing else, it's additional socialization and gives her a bit of independence that she likes (she does not drive anymore but rather a county-sponsored service picks her up and brings her home, door to door). Said van service can also take her to other appointments if need be or even grocery shopping. We have a RAZ cell phone for her that both tracks her and gives her security of calling pre-programmed numbers (me, my siblings, close friends, etc) if there was an issue while outside her house.

My brother lives with her (he has his own health issues so they benefit from having each other) but she can handle herself without issue if left on her own for days at a time if need be (we would NEVER allow that, but I state this to stress she is not a danger to herself or others at this stage).

update: We have her will and power of attorney completed. She and my father put the house in my brother's name before my dad died and my name is on her bank accounts. 

**With that info done...here is my question:**

While we have things under control now and could handle this for years and years I know it will, someday, get worse. I am simply seeing if anyone out there has any advice for me and my family at this stage.

Is there anything you wish you had done to better prepare your loved one / the family?

Are there any more progressive or unique types of therapy that you have seen help?

ANYTHING you wish to offer in terms of practical advice?","This is going to sound so weird, but if she has a favorite pair of leggings or slippers or a sweater or whatever it is, buy multiple and stash them away. I swear my MIL only wants to wear the same clothes each day. Its a situation to deal with laundry and 'finding something to wear'. Sorry for the weird suggestion. Maybe it's just our family.
Who will make her health care decisions when she is not capable?  Talk to her now about an Advance Directive.  There may come a time when you really do want a DNR in place and opt for palliative care. (This disease is brutal). Health care POA? Durable POA? Did you mention financial planning?  While she is capable, visit an elder attorney who can properly guide you. Most will do an initial consultation at no cost.  Add names to accounts.  The POA is only in effect while the person is alive so do the estate planning now.  Get a detailed medical history.  I didn’t know as much as I thought I knew and she couldn’t remember. Find things that she likes to do with her time. My mom paints, does word searches and jigsaw puzzles.  Figure out some hobbies that will take a little less mental exertion as things progress.  Early on we did short reading passages for comprehension, flash cards for word retention, but the doctor said those probably weren’t as helpful as normal conversation/normal identification/naming of objects.   I am not a medical professional and cannot advise, but she takes Donepezil, Memantine, several vitamins and turmeric/curcumin.  Put photo albums together—the kind that you can write a few short identifying words next to the photo. Maybe she can do that now. That will be helpful later.  Socialization is important but watch for signs of anxiety—knowing you don’t know creates a special kind of sad stress. Decide with your siblings a tentative plan of action (remain in home? Assisted living?) have the conversation now, get on the same page, knowing that it could change, but at least you all start with a common expectation and can have the conversation before it is absolutely necessary.  Take turns at caregiving if you become the caregivers. One person cannot do it. It’s too much. 

I could go on and on.  I wish you well in this journey.  Cry when you need to. Laugh when you can. Give her lots of love; I believe that somehow they still know what that is.
This isn't as important as POAs and stuff but I was talking to my mom about this and honestly we kinda wish we gave him (my dad) a dentist appointment before things started going downhill. Just for an easier ride, you know?
Sit down with her and your siblings (if possible) and get out old photos to reminisce on and learn about, or any heirlooms or things/people that you won't have a story about very soon. My mom compiled our family photos into albums-- no logic, organization or continuity,  but it got us looking at and recollecting the past for her with a lot of laughs. My baby book was equally enjoyable to look at together.
    If your mom made favorite foods of yours, get her to share her recipes. Some of my grandmother's best dishes went with her to the grave because she never wrote them down and I deeply regret not asking her when I still could.
if the house is not fully accessible (no stairs), she should move into her permanent home sooner rather than later. It will become harder to create new muscle memory and orientation later on, and it causes massive disruption when they get moved later, because they aren’t physically safe at home. 

If the house needs some remodeling such as walk-in shower, do that sooner instead of later as well. If you do any remodels; make it fully accessible NOW.

Keep having interesting and engaging conversation with her, and opportunities to socialize. Go through old photos and ask questions and do some scrapbooking and label everything. if she is on a roll with telling stories on a good day; record it. 

she has hearing loss, it needs to be addressed. get hearing aids now.  if possible, get her into some social activities like the senior center. 

If you go online you can find something like “the hygge game” for some icebreakers and conversation starters
Make sure you have all legal papers (POA, Will, Living Will/advanced directives) signed and set up now.  The more active people are, the slower their disease seems to progress.  Look into clinical trials.  General health plays into this a lot, so make sure she gets exercise, eats a healthy diet and stays hydrated.
1) ask her what her wishes are in the short, medium, and long term in regards to care. 
2) if she can’t find the words, fill in the blank for her until you guess correctly. I’ve learned this is the kindest method rather than making them “work” for it.
3) get creative around making instructions/labels for things that will help her keep her independence. For example, I made my mom a laminated step-by-step guide to making her daily latte every day when it became too confusing to remember on her own. 
4) Appreciate the good moments. It will help you stay present.
5) Keeping to routines and low-stress environments is everything. My mom still has some really good stretches when that happens. But stress and new environments can derail her cognitively and emotionally for days.
Does she have her funeral plans laid out?
I say this because somehow, over the years, my parents had 7 - SEVEN different plots paid for and it took my dad dying to finally force my mom to decide exactly where they wanted to be buried.
Don't sweat the small stuff!         Be prepared to adapt.         Head problems off at the pass whenever possible - eg simplify clothing (eg elastic waist only) downsize wardrobe, remove trip hazards, install night lights, de-clutter, etc etc.    

Dementia .org / Alzheimers .org do free workshops / mini-courses for family / friends / carers of the memory lossed and the memory lossed themselves.  If you are within reasonable reach of an office, avail thyselves!   Either way, they have tons of resources -- leaflets/booklets of info for all aspects all stages etc, counselling, telephone helplines,.... Expert experienced in all aspects of  memory loss diseases & conditions.  So sorry, it's hard, it's sad, but it can also be still many wonderful times with yr loved one.   Best of luck!
Please consider that some of your mom’s symptoms may be grief related, especially since your father died suddenly.
I wish I'd known about the hallucinations and delusions. I was not prepared for that level of insanity.

I wish I had pushed for memory care sooner, when my dad could still benefit from the socialization and activities and structure, and before the rest of us had to suffer the impact of his worst behavior. It isn't giving up. It's making sure they get the care they need.",2022-04-25 22:29:53,GizmoFringe,uc26qh
Dementia,Jelly Drops,"[www.jellydrops.us](https://www.jellydrops.us/) 

""Jelly Drops are award-winning candy designed to boost hydration. They’re 95% water, sugar-free and vegan with added electrolytes.

Inventor Lewis Hornby was inspired to create water candy after his grandma Pat, who had dementia, was struggling to hydrate.

With a fantastic solid, but smooth, texture - these candies do not have a liquid centre - encouraging independent hydration for all, through a delicious snack.""

I started following them years ago, and they're finally available for sale. Sadly, all three of my remaining grandparents have passed since then, but I wanted to share. I know how hard it is for those older ones to stay hydrated, and how much my grandmas in particular loved candy :)","Yes! On a previous thread regarding food, redditor HT_26 mentioned these so I put myself on the waiting list for them to come to the US. Got my email the other day and placed my order. Can't wait to check them out and hopefully my mom will like them.
Since they are sugar free, what is the source of sweetness?",2022-04-25 20:29:16,happy_bluebird,ubzu5c
Dementia,Mom's eating fewer foods that she's always liked,"So, my mom has always really enjoyed Hawaiian pizza, BLT's, Mexican food - and now she doesn't seem to like any of them. She says ""It doesn't taste right"" 

She, of course, still wants sweets, which, according to the Alzheimer's website is normal, but I have to be really careful because she's pre-diabetic.  

Is this the precursor to her refusing to eat entirely?  She is in stage 6d according to the research I've done.","I would talk to her doctor and weigh the pros and cons: the risk of her becoming diabetic versus her quality of life, enjoying the pleasure of sweet-tasting food.
I don't know the answer to your question but a lot of protein shakes taste sweet but are specifically made for diabetics.  Like there's glucose control versions of boost and glycerna.  I recommend those.

If she gets worse foodwise which I suspect she will, id put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in one meal per day too.  Oil is the most calorie dense food I know of with 130 calories per tablespoon.
There gets to be a point in life that quality is more important than quantity. Let her eat sweets.
Years before we realized that my mom had Alzheimer's,  she stopped being able to taste salt. Today, my mother's brain is failing her in so many ways, not being able taste foods properly lines up with all the other cognitive failures she is experiencing.
Dementia or not...people's taste buds can start to fail/weaken as they get older. Taste buds can shrink and become less sensitive, starting even as early as the 40's and 50's. Add into that, your sense of smell can weaken as you get older...and your sense of smell can affect your sense of taste. Other things like medications and illnesses can make it worse. Dementia just messes with all sensory input, in general...which does not help.

As some others have mentioned...you can get sweet protein/nutritional supplements that are meant for diabetics. You can also get alternative sweeteners to make the sweet goodies she likes...but makes it less risk for the diabetes.

Another thing to try...the sweet/salty can be the first to weaken. If they are saying the foods they used to enjoy taste different to them...try strengthening the flavor by adding more spices. Also, try alternating between bites of the food and drink.

My Dad is more recent in his dementia diagnosis, and not a severe decline yet...and I swear he has been salting, peppering, and ranch dressing seasoning everything to death for year. I am constantly having to wipe a layer of salt/pepper off his food table after each meal. And I even season the food really well.
My mom found things much spicier as she progressed. She used to like spicy food, but she went down to my spiciness level (I think too much pepper is spicy; forget anything like salsa, even mild; basically, there’s a joke that ketchup is called “Norwegian hot sauce” and I can kinda see where they’re coming from…). At least it meant she had a spiciness guide because I could tell what might be spicy for her that normal people wouldn’t even think of.

She had always liked sweets, but that definitely got much stronger. The sweet tastebud is apparently the one that stays around the longest. 

I remember my grandmother (at like mid stage) discovering sweet tea when we moved down South from New England. I remember her with water saying “this isn’t sweet enough”.

I would definitely agree with the others who have said about enjoyment of food being the main goal at that stage. We had already stopped some of the less necessary prescriptions at that point (with the doctor of course).
I hate to say it but has she been tested for c0vid? If it's not that it's probably the disease progression -- as my grandpa progressed all he ate was cookies and ice cream (literally that was IT). Just remember that the most important thing is that she's getting enough calories to survive and is happy. I wish you luck. Since she's pre diabetic it might be a little trickier but there's definitely options.
This may also be a sign of difficulty swallowing or chewing, expressed as ""not tasting right.""  This is associated with both dementia and the normal aging process.  The foods you are describing would be difficult if that is the problem.  It's also possible that she needs dental attention.

You can get that evaluated and possibly get some speech therapy where she (and you) will learn more about the mechanisms of eating and strategies for dealing with that.  In the meantime, you can try dicing her food into small pieces, adding thickener to her drinks, and encouraging her to clear her throat after every few bites.
Since she likes sweets and seems disinterested in foods she normally likes you could always try Boosts, Ensures or Glucernas. They have kinds that are good for pre-diabetics and managing blood sugar. They have a variety of sweet flavors she may like and you could possibly use the drinks (if she likes them) as an incentive to eat her food.
It is very common for elderly people to think that food is poison. It is because their sense of taste changed, and everything tastes bitter to them. I think your mom is at the beginning of this. 

Try giving her Ensure, they make a sugar free version.
Loss or changes in sense of taste and smell are common in dementia patients, as the disease progresses the affects can differ but if she is still wanting to eat then feed her what she wants.
Hey thanks for your input everyone.

The biggest problem now is that she is getting so she'll only eat junk food.  I allow her sweets from time to time but she's gaining so much weight I can't handle her.  She's closing in on 200lbs at 4'11"".  

Anyway, I'm calling her doctor tomorrow as it is because today she said she was hurting under her tummy (she has what is called an 'apron belly') and I looked and it's...bad.  

Always a new curveball.

Dementia,"It's Both Comforting and Depressing How Much Better My Grandmother Gets When Someone Needs ""Help""","Don't know if anyone has experienced this, my grandmother is in mid stage, moving into late. 

We can have an amazing dinner with her getting to see her great-grandkids, she will have a wonderful time, but the next day she forgets it happened.  Sometimes, if you remind her, she will partially remember it, other times she has no recollection.  

But the moment she is told someone in the family is sick, hurt, needs help, it's like her mind reverts back a decade.  

Six months ago when my mom had surgery, she called everyday to check on her.  She didn't need to be reminded or prompted.  

A few months ago when her great-grandchild had Covid, same thing.  

Yesterday, I was pretty sick.  I called up her and my grandfather to let the know that I was, and wouldn't be stopping by.  

Twenty minutes later, they were dropping off some fresh cut fruit for me and a bottle of juice.  

Talked to my grandfather on the phone and he said it wasn't his idea.  When I called, she was having a bad day.  Laying on the couch, not dressed at noon time, confused about where she was.  

The moment she found out I was sick though, my grandfather said she got up, she put on her clothes, went into the kitchen, got out some fruit from the fridge, cut it up, bagged it up, and told him her to my house to leave it on my porch.

Then this morning, I get an phone call from her, she's asking how I'm feeling, asking if I ate the fruit, telling me to make sure I drink a lot of liquids, and she just comes off as sounding very cognitive during the entire conversation.  


Like I said in the title, it feels both comforting and depressing at the same time.  

It's just so insane how the mind works.  Her mind has been breaking down for years now.  On my daily visits I'm asked the same set of questions every time.  When sundowning she gets angry, agitated, doesn't even recognize my grandfather most nights.  

But **she** is still there.  It's as if the moment she hears any one of us is sick, hurt, in trouble, her brain just uses everything it has left to kick into overdrive for a time period in order for her to focus on doing what she did for her entire life, take care of family.","My mom is the exact same way! She is confused about so much all the time. When this all first went completely downhill she wouldn't do anything but lay around or sit around in front of the TV. Now that my dad isn't doing well she is up bustling around the house doing housework she hasn't done in years just to help my dad out. And if anyone else in the family gets sick she remembers to ask about them every single day till they get well again.
man I could cry that is so sweet
❤️
Helping my wife care for her mother for the past 4 years, I've seen that people with dementia, like most every other person in the world, just want to be useful. With Ma now in stage 4, the biggest challenge is finding stuff she's able to do since she's can't even place napkins on the table without failing.
Maybe because it gives her a sense of purpose. Don’t feel depressed about it. I’m sure she loves taking care of her loved ones.",2022-04-25 17:32:04,amphetaminesfailure,ubw3gg
Dementia,Why do some healthcare professionals seem so wrapped up in fixing the dementia patient’s body that they remain blind to the realities of the patient’s mind—and it’s impact on caregivers? (A rant.),"My dad—who has dementia—is currently in the hospital for various reasons too complicated to get into here. The point is, his health is now stable, and the wheels are in motion for him to be discharged to a long-term-care facility today or tomorrow. 

That’s wonderful news for my mom who has been his sole caretaker for the past decade or so. In addition to having dementia, he also has a below-the-knee amputation, diabetes, COPD, and numerous other chronic health problems. She’s been the one who risks injuring herself multiple times a day when he falls while trying to transfer from his recliner to his wheelchair. She’s been the one to bear the brunt of his mood swings. She’s been the one to clean up his feces. She’s been the one he wakes up every two or three hours at night, for one reason or another. I mean, you guys all know the drill. 

The thing is, Mom had a choice between placing him in a short-term facility with a high-degree of physical rehabilitation (for about a week before being transferred to long-term care or home) or a long-term facility with a low-degree of physical rehab (indefinitely). She close the long-term option, *and the hospital’s care manager and a rep from the short-term place are guilt-tripping her for it.* 

They honestly don’t seem to grasp that he’s never getting better, or that taking care of him 24/7 is killing my mom, or that any effort he puts into rehab in a facility will never be duplicated of his own volition if he’s at home. 

Similarly, many of the doctors, nurses, and therapists who have cycled through his room have radiated this naive positivity that makes me, frankly, furious. The man hasn’t used his prosthetic leg since he got it almost a decade ago, he keeps mistaking the trash can for a window, and he’s told my mom he wants to stab her. Stop acting like Mom should cheerfully take him home and nurse him back to health. When can she live *her* life again?","Yes!  They see the part they are treating but fail the see the patient.  Support your mother in her decision and reaffirm it every chance you get.  It might make sense as well to pull aside the hospital social worker and have a serious discussion with them about how harmful this attitude is.
My wife is 59 and physically is in much better shape than your father, she is entering the final stages of FTD.

The hospital has been pestering me for over a year to bring her in for a mammogram. She also has a prescription for an industrial strength anti-cholesterol pill, going unfilled.
She will not regret making that decision. I have learned that I will listen to what the medical community tells me then do what I think is right.  They don't ""know"" us, they see a medical condition(s), and that is all they see.  Unless they have walked in our shoes they have no right to judge.  Kudos to your Mom for making that decision and to you for supporting her in that decision.
Our geriatrician is so focused on my mother’s depression that she doesn’t treat the dementia appropriately. Yes my mother has always been depressed, but right now we need help with other behaviours and to hell with the depression. 

Good on your mom for choosing the right decision. She has a whole community standing in support of her.

It’s so aggravating! For two years, I told my dad’s primary care doctor and his neurologist that his dementia rendered him no longer safe to drive. He’d stop in the middle of the road, change lanes without looking or signaling, and be oblivious to drivers around him. Neither took me seriously until he started to have panic attacks, and only then did the neurologist notify the DMV. Two years of him endangering the public because he put on a good show in their offices.
Nobody has a real grasp on Alz/Park/LBD. I've seen all sides - my husband is an EVP of Senior Living for a large company and has worked tirelessly to create the best care available bar none (he's actually one of the good guys). But we each experienced the loss of our dads within 18 months, both with varying degrees of dementia. So he's personally invested.

This is why I'm aghast of the behavior of the staff. If they're trying to urge her into a different care plan, there are reasons. It is up to HER and your father's physicians, period.
I hear you! Some pcp’s just don’t fucking get it. “Why hasn’t he been taking his statin?” Maybe because it’s a massive horse pill and he can’t remember his own name anymore? I’ve found that nurse practitioners tend to be more understanding of dementia as a whole than physicians, but that’s just an observation.
We did physical therapy with my Grandma before a trip to help with her balance and just try to get her ready for travel. Getting her to do the exercises correctly was a task. She managed the trip okay. When we got back it was brought up again, and I was like ""No."" Just doing simple stretches and movements took so much time and repetition and I knew it wouldn't make much difference at this point. 

I'm glad you are being supportive and reaffirming that the choice she is making is what's best for everyone.
Sometimes it's easier to emotionally support your partner when they don't rely on you for physical support. I hope your pop's transition into long term care is beneficial for of your parents.
I'm in my 50s and, if family history plays out, will have Alzheimer's at some point - hopefully not until my 80s. I've already started telling my family that they shouldn't treat anything aggressively after I'm unable to make those decisions. Dad and I didn't have that conversation, but I'm going to handle anything that comes up with him as I would want it to be handled for me.

You are especially on point regarding anything that would require rehab. The capacity to convalesce and rehab just isn't there and the big picture goal is what? Do what's humane and don't add suffering, but accept that it's a downward spiral.
Sometimes you have to ask “why”.  The doctor wants to put mom on a cholesterol drug, for example. I have to ask, why, what exactly are we protecting here? Why are we prolonging the bodies life while the mind is diseased and dying. So far, Mom’s doctors have not pushed back when I make it clear that all I am concerned about is her comfort
Thank God my grandfather’s doctor wasn’t like this.  Grandpa fell one morning, and the home healthcare worker had come to help him shower.  We opened his bedroom door, and he was stretched out on the floor.  I asked him what happened.  He said he thought fell after coming out of the bathroom and since he was laying down, decided to just go back to sleep.  The home healthcare worker asked him if he was in any pain, and he said his back hurt.  She advised to call an ambulance and have him taken to the hospital to get checked out.  His doctor came and checked on him and said that my aunt and I needed to talk about a nursing home.  The doctor said “You’ve done a great job taking care of him, but he needs more care now than you can give him.  You have to sleep at some point yourself.”  I had been doing most of his caretaking since my mother had died two years before.  The doctor also said that his prostate cancer had spread, and it could be treated, but he really didn’t have much longer.  We put him in a nursing home on April 8th, 2004.  He died exactly one month to the day he was admitted.  I didn’t realize how exhausted I was until I didn’t have to keep getting up in the middle of the night because he was confused about if was day or night, or he was playing with the thermostat until something, usually the heat, came on, or obsessing over how he was going to get to his next doctor’s appointment.  I was also lucky that a year before my mother died that I had a conversation with her and her sister about Grandpa not driving anymore.  They both agreed it was time.  I took Grandpa to his doctor’s appointment and I asked his doctor about him driving, and he asked my grandfather if he still drove, and Grandpa said “only around the block”.  The doctor said “Well, don’t go to far”, then looked at me and shook his head no.  I got ahold of Grandpa’s keys, and for about two weeks he asked if I could get a set made because he lost his.  I said I would do it later.  Thankfully he forgot, and just got used to me driving him.
My wife has dementia and the neurologist prescribed nutritional supplements — a total of 17 pills a day, with and in between meals. As a gastric bypass patient she has a tiny stomach. And these were mostly big fish oil sized pills. She wouldn’t eat more than a few bites of her meals. I said screw it and rotate a few key ones in at breakfast. No regrets.
We are in similar positions at this moment. The difference being that I got my dad into a rehab clinic and I’m in the process of getting him into a VA home permanently. For free even. The doctors and the social worker agree with me. 

My dad treats my mom like crap and she does everything for him. She’s 73 and he’s killing her slowly. 

I was able to talk my mom into finally letting him go to the VA home. Now that the day is nearing, she’s leaning toward bringing him home. I get it. He’s lost and confused there. He’s holding out hope of coming home and he seems positive about it. At home there will be some familiarity, but it’s exhausting taking care of him 24-7 and keeping him safe. 

I know my dad. The minute we get him home, he will revert to being angry and demanding, spitting phlegm on the floor and walls. My mom can’t do it alone. He will cry. She will cry. They will both be eternally miserable.
Here for ya!
They gave my mom a pacemaker so she could live to a hundred they said. I took Doc in hallway and asked him if he really thinks it’s best thAt she lived that long in the terrible shape she’s in? He said no it’s not. But he’s in charge of the heart and he took an oath as a cardiologist, to make sure a patients heart is in tip top shape. He said the brain will fail before the heart. She’s tired, she’s ready. Why will they not just let her have the peace she’s earned. They keep updating pills and appointments for this and that. It’s hell on us

Dementia,My step-father ( I need to vent),"My step-father has been a struggle for me. Before dementia he was an alcoholic, bi polar, abusive monster.   Present day, it’s gotten even worse.  He still drinks a case of beer or whatever he can get his hands on. He is diabetic as well and thinks no doctor can tell him what to do.  He buys alcohol with money given to him by his other children and sometimes my mom because she just gives in to avoid conflict. He has destroyed parts of this house usually when he is manic. which could last for weeks. Today he is currently hoarding all the potted plants into his bed room and spray painting them.

I’m autistic so I live at home with my mother and step father. My mother is an attorney, so most of the day she is at work. I work from home and the last 3 years have been hell. I’ve all of a sudden am the care giver to this man that I hate.  He has 3 children from other marriages and none of them give a shit about his condition.  I feel like everyone is gaslighting me when I try and explain what is going on at home. NO ONE listens to me. My family knows that I hate this man but I’d never not care for a person who is in need. I just wish something could be done because I can’t handle this much longer.","I'm hearing your hurt I am a solo care taker to my mom  with Demenita  GET OUT  if there are other children GET OUT!
Take a break. Go visit a friend for a week. Go camping. Just get out for one week. There are other of his kids, let them pick up the slack. You need time to recharge.
I hate this for you. I don't know how you've gotten through this long! Patience of Job.

Please, there has to be a way for you to get out of this mess? It is NOT YOUR JOB to take care of anyone other than yourself. I promise it will only get worse. I just feel your pain, and I'm sorry.
Oh gosh A\_Lion, so sorry that really sucks, I feel for you, what a nightmare.  My sister is ex-alcoholic, has abusive (unaddressed) mental health issues (she lives with me & alzhms mum who I'm carer for), so yeh, I can relate to being stuck with abusive monster.  grrrrrr....

I hope you can get away for a respite rest, or even somehow move out, find a new place to live or at least stay for a while?   I get that you don't want to leave a person in need, but you have zero obligation to being abused - not your monkey not your circus, as the saying goes.

His birth-kids & yr mom need to experience for themselves the full story of looking after him 24/7, they need to find some other options or solutions.    Contact dementia .org or alzheimers .org for your area, they ought to have some suggestions & advice for how to get through to yr mom & step-kids that he's as difficult & traumatising as he is, that you need to stop being his carer, and for respite / counselling for you, some sort of options for step-dad.

Dementia,Midnight madness,"Not looking for advice, just want to vent about my mom's latest meltdown. I live in the lower part of a split-level house with my elderly parents above. 

I woke up at midnight last night because my mother opened my bedroom door and turned on the overhead light, crying to me and asking ""who's hurting you?"". I was so confused and asked her why she was awake and fully dressed. She cried and told me that she heard me screaming in pain, and she kept begging me to let her take me to safety. I kept telling her I was asleep, I'm ok, no one's screaming, PLEASE go back to bed. She finally retreated upstairs, and I asked my bf, who had been in the next room watching TV, what happened.

He said she had been yelling down the stairs to him for 20 minutes about me screaming, with both him and my father trying to convince her nothing was wrong. As we were talking, I could hear her upstairs wailing to my father about ""how could he let someone do that to his own daughter"". He stormed downstairs to placate her, and she followed still weeping and yelling that my father wasn't helping me, and he's a monster. We all tried to convince her that I was ok, I had been sleeping! I even told her that I was probably having a nightmare (not true) and that's what she heard, just to get her to calm down. I had to plead with her for over 15 minutes to let everyone get back to sleep before she finally agreed to go back upstairs. 

I talked to my dad about it this morning, and apparently before waking me up last night, she got dressed and drove to the neighbor's house to get them to help me. I don't know what was said, but the neighbor knows about mom's issues - he once came over and informed my bf when he saw her hitchhiking down the road while my father and I were out for a few hours. And even more shocking than disturbing the neighbors, she PUNCHED my dad in the mouth when he refused to barge downstairs. This is the first time she actually hit one of us; usually it's just screaming vitriol, throwing things, and beating on doors. And usually I'm the target, so this is a completely new behavior. 

Today, she keeps going back and forth between apologizing and insisting that she heard my voice screaming, meanwhile being pleasant as pie. 

I'm just so tired today and in general.","I'm here. I see you. I feel your exhaustion.

It's just dementia... it's not her.

Sorry to hear that. I remember  being woken up in the middle of the night with similar experiences - also been punched!  It's good to hear your mom has a lot of people around her supporting her. You're always welcome to rant here, I wish I had known about this community before, it's great for cathartic release.
I’m sorry this is happening to you. I’m glad that you shared your story.",2022-04-25 13:00:34,Somethingokwhatever,ubpvpw
Dementia,Near the end. How much worse might this get?,"How much longer does mum have / how much worse will it get?   

I’m just looking for advice, I guess, or more accurately a rough road map of how the next few weeks or months might go. 

My mum is 58. She was diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer’s 3 years ago but had been suffering symptoms for at least 6 years before that. 

For months now she’s been unable to speak properly. She’ll say some words but they’re mostly unintelligible. Every now and again she’ll smile and wave as if she recognises me. She needs help with pretty much everything—getting up and washed and dressed and eating and moving around and using the toilet. My StepDad does everything for her. He’s an absolute saint. They do have carers go in every day to help him. 

These last few weeks she’s taken a worse turn. She’s currently in hospital on a drip (because she hasn’t eaten properly for weeks) and under sedation—because she’s been becoming violent, lashing out at my StepDad and the carers and even the dog. I can’t overstate how unlike her this is. Especially the dog—she’s the most gentle and animal friendly person you can imagine. Or she was. 

A CT Scan has shown aggressive dying off of brain cells. I’m getting this all second hand from my StepDad. As her designated carer he’s allowed to be up there with her but no one else is. The only reason I mention this is because I have a feeling this is it, this is the end times, but that he doesn’t really want to say so. I don’t know how specific the doctors would have been about his? But rapid dying off of brain cells sounds like the end doesn’t it? 

When she’s stable they’re going to send her home. They’re helping my StepDad get a hospital bed set up for her downstairs. He’s determined to have her home, which is fine, I know she’ll be happier there and he cares for her well, I just can’t even imagine the toll this is having on him. 

The reason I’m writing this is mainly to vent it, I guess, but also to ask if anyone can give us a rough idea of what to expect? How long we can expect to have her home before she’s gone, how much worse this is likely to get? Anyone that answers please do be honest, don’t sugarcoat it—I’ve always had a good relationship with my mum, I love her very much but I’m sure she’s ready for this suffering to be over. 

Thank you.","I would suggest to your Step Dad, if the hospital hasn't already, that he call for a hospice evaluation.  They would provide medical equipment, take over the handling of the medications, provide support for the family.  All this can happen in the family home.  They are also available by phone 24 hours.  Hospice care does not necessarily mean ""end of life"" care, in other words a person does not have to be close to death in order to receive hospice care.  I think most of the time a person, who is getting close to dying, stops eating and sleeps a great deal.  Death can come quickly or stretch out for a long time, there is no way of knowing.  Good luck and please follow up with a hospice evaluation, the support they give will be so helpful to all of you.
I'm sorry. I know how much this sucks.   


Many people seem to have vastly different experiences. Our experience was that when my mother was at the same stage as yours, we still had 4 years to go. All up, from diagnosis to death, was a decade. My father did the same thing as your stepdad, where he insisted on taking care of her at home. We spent years thinking 'this couldn't get worse' - and then it did, over and over again. For further context, she was diagnosed at 48, died at 59.   


But I assure you, there are silver-linings around the storm clouds. Do your best to find them.
We are ALL ready for this suffering to be over. God help the caretakers who have to endure this for years or even decades.
Brain cell death basically means her brain is shrinking and that’s why she’s acting off. Parts of her brain that used to be connected to each other can’t communicate as well. It’s probably rapid as in shrunk a bit since the last time she had a scan done, not like her brain is actively deteriorating as they watch it. I don’t think that it can necessarily be guessed how long she has based on that as far as I know.",2022-04-25 02:31:05,Donnager6,ubem0c
Dementia,Dad won't go to doctor to get diagnosis,"Really hoping someone can help! My dad is 70 years old and has always been exceptionally intelligent, though also a textbook narcissist and not always very nice. Last month he started acting very out of character, rambling for hours and being generally manic. He ended up going to the ER as he realized something was wrong; discovered he was having frontal lobe seizures and was prescribed an anti-convulsant. HOWEVER, due to the personality changes and diminished cognitive ability he displayed, was also prescribed an anti-psychotic, which he has adamantly refused to take. After a couple other ER visits/dr. appointments, it was clear this was more than just seizures. Some of his visit summaries/med charts specifically cite dementia, one in particular ""aggression due to dementia."" 

His condition continues to deteriorate, but he has decided he had a singular neurological incident and nothing else is wrong with him. Everyone is against him, the doctors committed malpractice and are colluding with his wife (my mom), he's going to sue, etc etc. He has effectively kicked my mom out of their house and told her they are getting a divorce. Unfortunately, this isn't a new thing and probably should have happened a long time ago. The main problem is that he refuses to go back to any doctor to get an actual assessment/diagnosis, won't take his prescribed medication, and is OVERTLY HOSTILE with anyone who brings up his medical care. 

He and my mom have done well over the years financially, but he has always taken care of all of their assets and business. They own several rental properties, have multiple bank accounts, stocks, IRAs, etc but she does not have access to any of them. I have found her a short term rental so she's not on the street, but we are completely unable to have a rational discussion with him about how she's going to support herself. I have no idea if he is paying his mortgages or other bills, filed his taxes, etc. It's not likely things are getting taken care of as every day he seems to slip further away. 

I know she needs a divorce attorney, but I'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation-- are there divorce lawyers that deal with this type of situation? How should we approach him, if at all? He is currently alone in a big house by himself, just deconstructing mentally but won't allow anyone to help since he ""doesn't have a problem."" I have no idea what I can do to help someone with these symptoms, let alone who has always been a difficult person to deal with anyway. Just kind of desperately reaching out into the Internet ether and hoping someone can give some guidance.","I personally wouldn't die on the hill of diagnosis. Even with meds, not much changes. The meds are intended to prevent further deteriorating. I did not see much positive from meds in my mom's situation and the doc was not forthcoming about making changes like not driving. Regarding bills, taxes etc. Talking about attorneys and accountants may be more acceptable and likely should be done for futures planning. Most folks know the value of having paperwork in one place, having a will, health care directives, etc. You could approach conversation less directly to reduce defensiveness. Good luck on your journey.
I would handle one thing at a time.  Make your Mom the priority right now.  Get an appointment with an Elder Attorney and go with her.  He/She can tell her what needs to happen in order to protect her.  The attorney may have other information on what can and can't be done regarding your Dad's behavior.  Unfortunately you can't force anyone to go see a doctor so you have to focus on  protecting your Mother. Good luck.
Instead of telling him what the appointment is for, try telling him that it is time for his follow up from that one incident he had. Or since he believes the doctors committed malpractice, maybe say that you want him to get a second opinion and that you found a doctor that you heard tons of great things about. 
Go along with his beliefs. It’s okay to not tell him absolutely everything. And the doctor’s office may go along with your story as well.
Your description of his symptoms makes me think of frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) but the seizure in the frontal lobe could probably have some effect as well.
You need to move fast. From the situation you describe, he may already be attempting move and hide money and that could be a disaster.  

If his visit summaries and discharge notes are noting dementia, he has sufficient diagnosis to take action. Further medical appointments would be focused on determining the cause and any possible treatments.

IANAL, but it seems the priority should be gaining control of finances before he can do any more damage. Even an emergency temporary court order (based on the already existing medical records) would help to get the bank, investment companies, etc. to prevent rash choices.  An elder care attorney will have the better perspective than a divorce attorney.  A court order might also motivate (or require) him to go to a doctor to ""prove"" that he is competent.   

It's going to be ugly, and I'm very sorry for that. A good elder care attorney is going to take a lot of the burden off your shoulders.
Sounds just awful! The value of a diagnosis is to be able to avail yourselves of some services, as well as what you might need legally. Definitely visit with an elder care attorney. Surely with those assets your folks had an attorney to deal with some of it. They should at least be willing to tell you if there is a will, POA’s, etc, although they won’t be able to show them to you.  

My wife refused to see a doctor for anything, and as I and many others predicted nothing happened until a crisis. Then she wound up being taken to the hospital involuntarily and now is in a memory care facility. 

Glad your mom’s safe and out of the house. 

Good luck
Very sorry you're going through all of that. I think you need to reach out to professionals in divorce law first, then also get help from experts in dementia (someone like Teepa Snow could help with at least a good referral?). I wouldn't approach him about these difficulties while he is so aggressive; I think (iana expert) it's usually a phase which he should come out of at some point - just don't *expect*  the next phase to be back to normal or even better than this one, although it sounds like he's at a real low so hopefully his attitude can improve.
I am sorry you are dealing with this. We do not get training to help support aging individuals. I have learned from my experience working with people with disabilities, my personal experiences trial and error, and happen to be a Board Certified Behavior Analyst which helped me navigate the dementia waters. It was not easy even for me. I always tried to do what was right based on my values of providing respectful care and understanding of the implications of the disease. You mentioned mom getting a divorce. That seems like a decision that has pros and cons for Mom's future that may need some serious consider based on the laws of your state. Letting dad make bad decisions could seriously negatively impact on mom.
Agree with the advice to get an elder attorney for the financial side. There is a formal process with a judge to determine his competency, and that can take time. 

If he's not safe to care for himself, his primary care doctor can determine that he does not have capacity to make a certain decision, such as the decision to reside at home. This is a much faster process. They could determine that he didn't have capacity to change his healthcare POA, so the old POA could still be in effect. Then they could say he doesn't have capacity to be making medical decisions and the medical POA could be enacted to have him placed somewhere for safety. If the MD will not make that call and you're still concerned that he is unsafe, you can call Adult Protective Services, but that can be a long process as well. 

No matter what, get mental health support for everyone who accepts it. You all have a tough road to travel. Be well
Hi there. I am sorry you are going through this. Another commenter mentioned FTD, which his symptoms and physiological changes in his frontal lobe may be headed in that direction. An elder law attorney would be the best place to start. If they are still legally married and you have his diagnosis on paper of cognitive changes/memory loss, they will be able to help. He will need someone to be his DPOA for healthcare and finances. This may be done without an attorney dependent on your state. What I wanted to comment was this: there are good resources from the Association for FTD. They have a helpline: 866-507-7222. I mention them specifically bc FTD causes many many personality and behavior changes, none really for the better, and they are trained in this specific dementia. The Alz association will also be a good resource: 800-272-3900 (this line is 24/7). I am wishing you the best of luck and peace!
Could be encephalitis? There's always alternative diagnosis's.",2022-04-25 00:33:05,alabasterduchess,ubcsgt
Dementia,Delusions derail the whole day!,"My mother has had nonstop delusions today. It’s been so frustrating! She talks to imaginary children and then wants to take them home and yells at everyone until we take her for a drive to see if that would help her stress. She’s giving me driving directions even though she doesn’t know where she is. She wants me to stop people taking walks and ask them where the children live! Then she’s raging at my dad cause she thinks he wants to kill her and that he has a tiny woman living under the bed in a shoebox. She heard my dog bark at someone and now she thinks the dog died because of it. She’s now morning the dog who is happily running back and forth through the house chasing a ball. Sorry. I just had to vent! Ugh! I’m glad I’m going to work tomorrow so I can take a break from this stress.

Edit:

Thank you all for your support and for the great suggestions. I’m going to have a talk with my dad when I get home and hopefully come up with an action plan. My poor dad is so tired 🙁","Im sorry its okay to feel how you feel its good to vent
Have you considered she may have a uti? They can sometimes cause erratic behavior. I assume it would be hard to get her to the doctor to check but worth the effort.
My dad died last month after fighting Lewy Body Dementia. What you're describing sounds exactly like what he experienced. In fact, part of him knew what he was seeing wasn't really there. He saw all sorts of animals and bugs and children. Thought my mom was not really his wife of 55 years. 

We took him to a geriatric psychiatrist, who admitted him into a behavioral health hospital to find the best med combination as safely and as quickly as possible, and it was able to give both him and my mom some calm and order in his last weeks.

I completely understand the anger and frustration. I hear you.
My uncle has dementia he has stayed with us for two years, previously he was homeless by his choice. He became delusional, for example he said he was moving in with his step-daughter and her mom. Her mom has passed away a very long time ago and he said he never called or messaged his step-daughter he just talks to her in his head. He has came to my bedroom tried to push me out the way to come in my personal space because the way my house is set up it’s similar to the house he lived most of his life in and my bedroom is about where his bedroom used to be. It is incredibly frustrating to deal with no doubt. For me I felt anger, confused, grief, so many mixed emotions. I am so glad for your rant because it’s better to get it out if your system instead of letting it build up until you pop like a balloon. My thoughts are with you and I hope that you catch the break you so badly deserve. Your doing the best you can and we see that. Dementia is a complicated layered mess of a disease. I can’t say it will get better but I know better days will come to you in the end.
Delusions or hallucinations or both? Seems pretty out of control to have so much going on in one day. Maybe check with the doctor for different meds?
My mom talks to her boyfriend everyday but she doesn’t know his name.  She thinks there are multiple women and children in the house.  She will whisper full on conversations with this man and then yell at the women to leave.  Everyday it is the same thing.  She will be ok in the mornings but come afternoon she gets very agitated and verbally abusive.  We are trying to get here into a memory care facility but it is taking a long time.
That’s not behaviour I recognise. Could it be possible she has two things?
My dad has Lewy body and he is behaving like that.. Donepezil is working well for him, in particular reducing  hallucinations, but he is still delusional quite often.",2022-04-24 19:13:56,Xellossthecutie,ub6z65
Dementia,Sad and Worried about fathers future,"My father has had parkinsons for 15years. Currently 64. His first 10-12 years the progession has been 'okay' he loved alone and was fairly independent. Unfortunately he deteriorated during covid and was admitted to hospital in February this year due to distressing hallucinations.

He is currently still in an assessment ward 8 weeks later after initially expecting to be in for  2 to 3 days respite. 

While there hasn't been a formal conversation hid presentation suggests it's progressed to parkinsons dementia. He has some really good days and some really bad.  Some days he is lucid and understands others he thinks he works on the ward (used to be a physiatric ward mgr). 

He has been told he will not be able to go home to his current accommodation. He is being assessed for very sheltered (independent living) but have suggested he may require care home. 

He has always said he doesn't want to go in  to care. I love him so much and visit every day and do all I can but work full time and live in upstairs flat with no easy access to shower etc so he can't come live with me. 

How do I live with him going in to care? I hate the thought,  but I want him safe and in as little distress as possible.

He is widowed and his family stay 2 hours away and don't visit. How can I make him ""happy"".","You have cared for him as long as you could.  Now you can't, because he is too sick for one person to care for alone.  The doctors are saying that, not just you.

Don't beat yourself up because you can't do the impossible.
So sorry you and he have come to this point.  But you have already said why going to a care facility is best for him:  "" but I want him safe and in as little distress as possible.""  That is why you move him to a care home.  You can have peace that he is safe, being fed, having others around, activities.  You are unable to provide the care he needs, he just needs more than any one person can provide.  Don't feel like you have somehow failed him, you haven't, you are looking out for his best interest.  Sometimes doing the right thing is hard but necessary.
Calling /u/SunOak3926.   Can you help?
That's a tricky situation as I don't know your dad's history. Generally if there is an acute illness of infection that results in a hospital admission delirium normally ensues. Patients can be delerius during their entire hospital stay and once treated for infection/illness and returned to their normal home environment things usually settle after a few weeks. Things can sometimes be made worse in hospitals as patients don't always receive their meds on time and their medications might be changed - exacerbating things further (but also sometimes unavoidable).

If it was a gradual decline e.g. you noticed things cognitively haven't been right for the weeks or months leading up to his admission then that is different, its likely he does have Parkinsons dementia. If that is the case, the safest place for him to be would probably be in a rest home or nursing home where he has trained professionals around him 24/7. It will also allow you to keep the father and daughter relationship rather than carer and father, which is obviously unavoidable in some situations but the strain can be heavy on both parties.",2022-04-24 17:35:52,Technical-Part-4425,ub4ytr
Dementia,I come seeking advice.,"This is my second post here. And I appreciate all the support I got on my last post for not making me feel like I’m insane. 

4/22 my father fell and hit his head (on blood thinners so we immediately called ems) he has a laceration from it. He blamed my child who wasn’t even in the room w him. 

4/23 at 5 pm my time we caught him falling and he only hit his butt, because we caught him mid fall. At that time I took his cane away and enforced a walker only rule. 

At 930pm he fell and hit his head again. He tried to blame it on my 17 mo old who had been asleep for 2 hours. 

This time he is admitted, even though the attending wanted to discharge him I protested and won. 

This is his 6th hospital visit in 8 weeks. I’m asking the hospital to put us in touch w a social worker and care management worker so we can place him in a home or facility till we can get him somewhere permanent. (We have a meeting w a care placement coordinator Monday so we’re already on it.) 

I’m not gonna lie. Money is super tight. But he has BCN advantage HMO and from what I’ve read they should cover it especially since he has zero funds. 

At this point from my self it’s basically 24/7 care and watching. My mother in law and wife cover when I’m sleeping (I haven’t been able to work for over 2 years pre pandemic cause of it) 

What do I need to say or tell the dr’s to look for to have him put in a rehab facility or SNF? Im I’m Michigan btw. So idk what that affects care wise. 

But we’re just done. We can’t do it anymore. We spent 400k on a new build house built to his needs and he has been here less than a month and has deteriorated immensely and had all these falls. (It’s a one story ranch style house with tons of items out in place, grab bars, rails, etc.)

Im at my wits end.","My husband started his disease progression by falling off a 5 foot tall retaining wall and landing on his head.  Then began a year of him falling all of the time.   He could be standing, take a step and fall for no reason, nothing in his way.  I rearranged the whole house so there were no obstacles and he still fell.  It was just maddening, like I couldn't take my eyes off of him for a second.  He was given a prescription for Carbidopa/Levodopa (for balance) and he has not fallen since.  He stumbles at times but has not gone down. So, maybe while you are looking for a placement for him ask his doctor if this medication would be helpful.  Also, go see an Elder Attorney if you haven't already.  They can be sure the family is set up with whatever documents may be needed in the future and can also advise you on how to fund any placement and protect assets if needed.  They can assist with Medicaid paperwork if needed, which I understand can be difficult and time consuming. Generally medical insurance, including advantage plans, do not pay for assisted living facilities.  Those are considered ""custodial"" and not a ""medical"" need.  It doesn't seem like your Dad has a ""medical"" need, or if he does it is most likely short lived.  Good luck, sorry you are on this journey, every step is difficult.
How many days has your dad been in the hospital? Usually they need to be in the hospital for a 3-day qualifying inpatient hospital stay. Then they can be transferred to a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) that is covered by Medicare. But the reason for the SNF is for ""rehabilitation"" and physical therapy, etc.

But Medicare only pays for short stays at a SNF. But once your dad is at the SNF, they can't kick him out because Medicare runs out. You can apply for Medicaid which will pay for long term care at a SNF. But if he doesn't qualify for Medicaid, then he needs to transfer to a private pay assisted living facility.

You definitely need to speak to an Elder Care attorney. You mentioned paying $400,000 for a new house. That could be a problem with qualifying for Medicaid. The Elder Care attorney can help you with that information.",2022-04-24 03:31:18,svtf0525,uapdtf
Dementia,I’m worried about my mom,"My mother is turning 60 this year and I’ve never been concerned about the state of her mental health other than her severe depression and crippling anxiety. A couple months ago my brother told me to keep an eye on her, said she was “airheady lately”. I hadn’t noticed anything of the sort not till now. My mom has never had much trouble finding things other than her car keys. But a few weeks ago, she came in my room asking where her purse was I asked did you check under your bed or your car she said she had looked everywhere. She started canceling cards and I was just as convinced as she was that it was missing. Until I went out to her car to get my charger I saw her purse sitting on the floor of the passenger side. I’m thinking in what world could she have missed that. So this is already unusual behavior. But last night and tonight is what really has me worried. Last night I was doing my hair in her bathroom and she asked if I had work the next day I told her yes I go in at 2. Within the hour she asks me again, “do you work tomorrow” I laughed a little and said yeah you just asked me that. She looked at me absolutely bewildered, she said no i didn’t I don’t recall kept saying she didn’t remember and I’m assuming joking accused me of gaslighting her. And tonight I asked for her vape she said she left it in her friends car, I asked if she was sure before I drive over and get it she said there’s no where else it could be she’s looked everywhere. So I go and I look, it’s not in her car. I come home and I ask her again is it in your purse she told me I could look, it was in her purse. Plain as day. Maybe I’m being dramatic but does this behavior show signs I should be concerned about?","My husband does this, diagnosed with Parkinson's dementia, my life is finding his things which are in plain sight but he can't see them.  That being said, there could be a number of things going on and she needs to be seen by her doctor and maybe have a neuro referral.
Yes, I would definitely have her see her family Dr. Go with her. Write a note the receptionist can give to the Dr beforehand explaining the situation with examples. He may do a mini mental test with her. Ask for a consult for a specialist. Also the Dr may order a CT or MRI of her brain and other tests such as bloodwork to rule out out any other cause. 

Be sure your Mom has a will and enduring power of attorney which can be enacted if she is deemed incompetent. And a Personal directive which enables a person to be appointed to make healthcare decisions for her, again if/when she is deemed incompetent. She may be in the very early stages but it is So important to start early to have the proper paperwork done.
My mom is turning 61 this year and I truly hope someone is gonna answer to this post because I feel like I'm in the same boat as you.

My mom forgets stuff I told her as well and she just starts slowly to act very off sometimes.

My grandpa ( her dad) had dementia and his symptoms worsened so badly, in March 2020 got diagnosed, September 2020 died. (symptoms worsened full speed till September without mercy)

I'm so terrified when my mom seems off.

Take care. Big hug!
Hi there, unfortunately my mum has been doing a lot of the same things. It's progressed over the past 2-3 years. She is now 70.  I'm not sure what started first, but a list of things I can remember are: extreme accusations of my dad stealing her things (such as her phone, keys, wallet). Then also the same line of questioning, asking if I was working tomorrow, and within literally half hour or so, the same question again. She would forget the days, and I'm not sure if she knows the year. Conversations we've had would just be nom-existent to her the next day. One day we had a really bad disagreement, and the next day she had no recollection of it. It's probably best to get her checked out with the GP. My mum recently had a CT scan but we haven't heard back yet regarding the results. Best thing we have done last year was finally getting the power of attorney setup. I do suspect she has an underlying mental health issue, but her generation is all about putting on a facade and not discussing feelings at all. She's incredibly stubborn. She also has had a few other health issues over the years too. I hope you do find the root cause of it.
Rule out medical causes. So many things cause confused behavior, include urinary track and lung infections, drug interactions, yeast infections, even COVID.
The Drs office should also be able to give you numbers for Senior Resources and Alzheimers Society for your area.
My husband is 59 and same here. We adjusted his meds to lessen his tremors,but he is constantly tired and forgetful. He wanders away in stores forgetting we came together. He eats both our dinners while I am away bc he forgets he ate. Can’t follow basic two steps directions. 

His neurologist, who sees him 10 min. in office, says he is fine. HE IS NOT FINE.
It's concerning, but that just means seeing a doctor, letting the doctor know what's been observed and going from there. It could be dementia, it could be depression or any of the many other things that look like dementia that are completely treatable.
She should get her vitamin levels checked. Brain fog could also be menopause which could be mitigated with HRT.
Have her draw a clock on a sheet of paper and put # in place and the ask her to draw any time you decide 4:15 5:30 

you  will have a strong indication after seeing the drawing.

Dementia,Clink Goes the Candy Dish,"That's the sound I'm currently hearing after an exhausting weekend.  She finished it yelling at me for washing/grooming her dogs while she watched Forest Gump. I did it too late but I didn't want to be stuck here doing the laundry tomorrow on no sleep. It's harder to walk early in the day. After she finished the movie , she told me how terrible it was . That's been the theme and it's getting to me. I went to find something else when she told me she was going to sleep . That was 2 hours ago while I waited to wash the fur off me . She's eating candy  in the dark. 

Anyway, I finally got some weekend help. My uncle agreed to have someone come in on Saturday so I can go home and sleep a few hours .

I promise you matter so much more! Being a caregiver is a rough and soul crushing job. I am glad you had the opportunity for some self care. That is so important to do! Hoping for a better day for you tomorrow as well. And if no one has told you lately, thank you for being a caregiver. 🖤
The beauty of your selfless act of caring for someone as you are clearly shines through your message. Not everyone can take on the monumental task and last even a day, so you are ahead of the rest. I'm sorry you are not receiving the praise and appreciation you definitely deserve from your family, but although I don't know you, you have my utmost respect and admiration. I am not disabled and struggle even during a day visit with my mom. My hat goes off to you.  Thank you for your help.

Dementia,I found my mother with some of my undies,"I am in the early days of dealing with the possibility of dementia with my mom.  I feel at times there is something off with her. Something not quite right.  It's different every single day.  Some days are good and then other days are not so good. 
The main behaviours have been mood changes and easily angered, some silliness, some ocd. 

Mood changes - some days she talkative and other days there's nothing but silence from her
Easily angered - there were incidents where she blows up at me easily and over nonsensical things. Like I was preparing a parcel for sending away before and she went into a range at me. Another time I was looking for a pan from the cupboard and that was another episode from her. Another time I reached for a clean kitchen towel. Small incidents that would anger her. Another time she blew up at me over the laptop when I was setting it up. She has no knowledge of computers or internet and I was setting up my laptop to sit down together with her and she blew up at me shouting - 'I will do it's. 
Silliness - getting me to do online shopping for her and getting me to buy her more shoes even though she has loads of shoes.  Last year during lockdown she wanted more 'going out' or 'fancy' shoes for wearing to am event.  She has a wardrobe of shoes for such events but she wanted more even though we had no events to go to.  We were in lockdown.  I think in her mind she thought the whole country was going to break out and go dancing at each crossroads the minute the pandemic ended and she was buying to party. I don't know. 
She was never OCD when I was small. She is still not very particular OCD but she is spending a lot of her time cleaning and needlessly cleaning more and more. There's a lot of time and effort spent of cleaning.  It's almost as if she wants to maintain control. 

I know a lot of the time forgetfulness and confusion presents with dementia so this is very difficult for me..  I think there is some forgetfulness but it's very, very mild and hardly noticable. This wasn't the first thing for me to raise alarm bells. 

It was earlier this year after yet another silent episode from her that I started piecing together bits and pieces over the past 2 to 4 years with when I started thinking on the lines of dementia. I think she is going senile. Every day is different from her. 

I am in a place where I don't know how to move forward with my suspicions. I am apprehensive about emailing or writing to our gp practice. We attend the same practice.  I would feel more comfortable speaking face to face with my GP to see if they could put a note on my mom's medical file to explore dementia for when my mom goes next. 

Today I found something new with my mom.  
She had a rack of clothes drying and there amongst some of her undies was a bra that looked familiar to me. I had a closer look and it was one of my bras for sure. We would be different sizes and we would shop in different places. I looked at the tage and it was my size.  I am plus size so My band size would be larger than hers.   My mom never does laundry for me so there's no way she picked up this up and put it into a load of her own laundry. There's no way this bra was lying around the home for her to pick up.  Another thing is that I have my clothes and undies divided up into good wear and every day wear.  This bra would be a bra for good wear.  It was a good bra.  I remember last year when going to an event, I thought I had more bras but I couldn't find them.  I even checked my laundry basket and definitely a lot of my good bras were gone. I didn't think anything more of this. I thought maybe it's in a bag somewhere. And here today I found my mom with one of my bras. I am completely shocked that she has a bra from me.  So she robbed my bra and possibly even more as if it was hers. There's no excuse in the world to rob my bra though.   

I know if I asked her she would give me an excuse of buying it in a second hand shop. I found her with other things before that looked familiar and she told me that she bought it before. 

It's just a new incident to add to the list of doubts that I have.",Sounds like frontal temporal dementia behaviors. My mom did lots of weird things up until diagnosis. See if you can get her in to a neurologist.,2022-04-23 19:07:14,summerrosegarden,uah76h

Dementia,How can I make my Dad a ward of state in NC?,"My dad has dementia. I am not able to take on the role of guardianship. I can no longer get power of attorney because he has already been diagnosed. Currently he is staying with my Aunt but she wants him to move out. Before he was alone and declining quickly. 

Nobody else want to take on the guardianship role either. Our only option to get him help is make him a ward of the state. Any help on how to do this would be appreciated.","I would also recommend getting legal advice. I am not familiar with NC specifics, but a dementia diagnosis does not make a person incapable of signing POA. It is important how far progressed they are. If your dad can still comprehend what he is signing, it would still be able to be signed as far as I am aware. 
Your local Council on Aging should be able to point you in the direction of an organization that can help you with the legal stuff. Good luck!",2022-04-23 12:59:08,Slackoslacko,ua9srm
Dementia,How do I know if my grandma has Alzheimer's or normal memory loss? Scared to ask family.,"I haven't seen my grandma in years, and she's staying with family on the other side of the world. She's impossibly healthly for her age, she has a full head of thick hair better than today's teens (although grey) and all her teeth are shiny and look like they came out of a toothbrush commercial. She has zero, and I mean zero, health issues. She lives on a farm with the rest of my family, and never has unhealthy food. 

A couple years back when my dad visited her, she forgot small things, like she'd remind him to eat lunch repeatedly even though he just ate lunch in front of her half an hour ago. Nowadays, my dad talks to her frequently, but apparently she doesn't recognize him 20 minutes after he's just introduced himself again and he has been talking about life. When asked to identify people, she pointed at her grandson (my brother) as being the son of ""this lady beside you"" (my mom) rather than referring to him as her grandson, and as my mom as her daughter in law. I thought this was absolutely crazy; my grandmother was a pharmacist and has the most knowledge I know, so forgetting seems very out of the picture. 

I think that our extended huge family living with her helps her with tasks, but I'm not sure if she can manage by herself. My father has said that she has Alzheimer's, but he doesn't say it definitely, he just says it like ""she's old and she's forgetting things, like dementia, like alzheimer's"" saying the whole spectrum and he doesn't seem sure, but he might be about alzheimer's, I'm not sure if he's saying she has normal memory loss for her age or if she has the brain degeneration illness of Alzheimer's. 

I was really scared and sad because I heard Alzheimer's has no cure, and my grandma used to give people medication as a pharmacist, so to think that she cannot remember a thing while her brain degenerates is scary while she depends on others for medication. I don't know if she takes medication either. Does this sound like someone with normal age-related memory loss, or actual dementia/Alzheimer's? What have you noticed early on in your relatives with Alzheimer's?

I know I'll figure out whether she has normal memory loss or Alzheimer's by asking my family; but I don't want them to worry and they'd probably gloss over the severity for me so I wouldn't worry. I actually asked my mom and she said my dad was overreacting and it was just normal memory loss that she has seen plenty of times in older people. Now I'm pretty confused whether I should be worrying about my dad now or not, and about myself. I heard this was genetic, does that mean in the future my dad (grandma's son) and I (along with my siblings) will get Alzheimer's? None of my grandma's siblings (older and younger than her) have it. I now feel like someone who has been told their dad has 6 months left to live, or that I have 1 month left to live. I'm super terrified for my grandma, my dad and my siblings.","There's not a lot of ""normal"" memory loss tbh.  If you can't remember the name of a person who lived in your neighborhood 20 years ago, sure, but if she's reminding him to eat lunch repeatedly even though he just ate lunch in front of her half an hour ago, that is most likely some type of dementia, yes.  And my money would be on Alzheimer's as it's one of the most slow-acting for a lot of people.  

But I'm not an expert.  And most likely there isn't a formal diagnosis from a doctor yet.   I wouldn't live your life in fear of getting it, there is most likely some genetic component but lifestyle  probably plays a big part as well.  People can live 15 or more years after an Alzheimer's diagnosis sometimes, it's not an immediate death sentence.  And there are drugs now that can slow symptoms somewhat.
""Normal"" memory loss is ""Oh, gosh, I can't find my keys again.""  ""I can't recognize my son"" is not normal.  Your mother doesn't want your father or you to worry, but that doesn't mean that this is normal.

What your grandmother is showing now may be ""dementia"", or memory loss and changes of personality.  There are a lot of possible causes of dementia, and Alzheimer's is only one of them.  I think it might be helpful if you read a web page or two on dementia.  That would help you get a sense of what is going on and what your family can do to help.  Here's a good one.  https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/

Notice that dementia symptoms can be caused by medications, by urinary tract infections, and by other treatable things.   Your grandmother needs to see a doctor, who will be able to see if any of your grandmother's problems are caused by treatable things, an who will be able to suggest how to improve your grandmother's life in general.  

Don't jump to ""if my grandmother has dementia, then my father and I will.""   Even if your grandmother does have dementia, that slightly raises your risk, but it's by no means a guarantee.  

This is all shocking and hard to cope with, and I'm sorry.
The difference:  if memory loss impacts/impairs your daily living then you most likely have some type of cognitive impairment.
When memory loss impacts someone’s ability to make it through the day independently, you are beyond “normal” aging",2022-04-23 12:16:59,eudaemoniaa,ua8x28
Dementia,Grandma’s eyes change?,"So, yesterday my mom and I spent some time with my grandma and her mood was very erratic. Happy/okay then angry/aggressive and snappy. I noticed when she was angry her eyes would change. Like, they would go dark almost black in the irises. And when she was back in a normal mood, her eyes would be their normal brown. Has anyone else noticed this? Oh! And her face changes—like it goes slack. It’s the oddest thing. (We’ve already had her checked for a yeast infection if anyone asks) Idk this whole thing freaks me out, the last time she was like this was back in January.","Yea, my grandma has a blown pupil from an accident, but we had to pay attention because she looks different when she’s verbally aggressive. Especially goes “dark” after anesthesia
Absolutely. My dad's eyes would go black when he had a psychotic/aggressive episode. I'm not religious but still, the only way I could describe it was as some kind of demonic possession. More prosaically, I think they get into such an extreme state of arousal (as in fear/anger) that their pupils dilate massively.
My sympathies. It's disturbing as hell. The behavior is bad enough, but the crazy eyes are just the icing on the cake.",2022-04-23 12:13:51,ThatGrangerGirl32,ua8unw
Dementia,Having a hard time on my floor,"I work in activities and honestly I find myself completely alone in our room for hours sometimes. I try my best to run activities, have conversations, and keep everyone safe but damn is it hard sometimes. I find myself almost crying during resident breakdowns, after getting swung on, after being told how useless and stupid I am. The Nurses aids don’t seem to care as they sit on their phones talking to people and watching videos, the nurses seem annoyed by my very existence after I have to take someone out of the room for a change, behavioral issues, inability to stay seated in their wheelchairs while I try to keep 5 others in theirs and convince a certain resident to please stay in his chair as he is a fall risk… and all he wants to do is show me the box outside the window and the cowboys coming for us. I try diverting…. I try gentle hand holding and eye contact but sometimes I just can’t hold back and tears stream down my face and mask… so I go quickly to our little office and try to regain my composure. I now feel like a prison warden helping prepare people for their slow deaths. I love all of them so much but it’s like the world forgot about them and they are slowly disappearing.

All you need is love.","Virtual hugs. As a hospice visiting registered nurse case manager when I have patients at facilities that have a activities Director or team that are out there with the patients I am beyond impressed and find them so valuable and precious.

I see my patients wherever they live whether at home or various facilities in two counties within south-central Pennsylvania and I do have occasions where I see nurses that seem to have so much not to do versus spending time with her patients but then again there’s also places I go to where the nurses are very involved.

I am sorry for what you’re experiencing but know that what you do to help your residence maintain function and a semblance of a normal life is valuable and precious. Thank you for what you do.
Bless you for doing this. I know it's hard, but the residents enjoy the interaction and activities, even when it seems they don't. 

My MIL will often complain that the activities are ""stupid and pointless and a waste of time,"" but that's when she's frustrated with something and lacks the verbal skills to articulate what's bothering her. She lashes out and complains and has mini tantrums like a toddler. But she's almost always present and doing them (she wouldn't do them if she didn't enjoy them), especially for that balloon game where they toss the balloon back and forth. My God, she can do that for hours.
Thank you for taking such good care of your residents.  Remember that they live in the moment so each moment of peace and happiness you give them literally means the world to them.  I wish we could do better for them.  My husband and I just spent the last hour agonizing over the fact that there is literally *nothing* we can do that will make his mother happy.
My mom enjoys just having someone to talk with and when the aides give her little hugs it makes me feel so good to see her smile.
I just started a part-time job as an activities assistant in a memory care unit. I spent my first full day in the unit yesterday, shadowing my boss and helping run activities. I had a good time interacting with the residents for the most part. Though one in particular wanted to be near me (she’s so sweet) and it was hard trying to make sure everyone was participating with her needing my full-on attention. I did the best that I could, and my boss seemed to be upset at me. I also ran into a situation where I left to wash my hands after doing some painting activity and came back to one resident trying to drink the paint. A nurse aid was nearby but didn’t care to try to stop it. I have a feeling that I will be on my own a lot and I’m kind of nervous because I don’t want anything bad to happen. 

I don’t like that my boss thinks only one person should be running activities when I think there should be two because of incidences like with the paint, etc. plus it’s also hard getting any nurse aid to come by to help with a breakdown when I have also ran into the same situation of them being on their phones. 

Anyway, you are doing the best you can possibly do. I’m sorry you’re experiencing this. If you need to go to the office to gain composure, then do so if you find it helpful. My therapist told me to do the same thing if I find myself getting overwhelmed, to find a space where I can just cry.
Bless you. My dad is fairly newly in a memory unit and I so appreciate you. You probably don’t spend a ton of time directly with him - I’m there most days and he tends to be a bit of a loner. But I see the time and effort and care and patience that the aides take with the residents- some/many of whom are incredibly annoying- and I am so thankful for them. You may feel invisible sometimes but you are a true warrior and a hero.",2022-04-23 12:12:14,PutinIsaimbecile,ua8tg6
Dementia,Manipulative and Coercive,"Thanks for reading my post. 

My mother has been living in independent living now for about 4 months. She no longer drives, we took this away since she was getting lost. We took away her credit card,  frivolous spending. 

She is no longer cooking, we are afraid she will leave stove on.she can get meals at her facility . 

She has now turned to her neighbor to manipulate and coerce her into 'buying' her things. Toilet paper, shampoo, cheerios, frozen meals, soap.
Mom had plenty of this. No need to buy extra and hoard.

 We didn't know this was happening. This patterns are not new to us. We have known for many years she was manipulate. That is why she is living now where she is. 

Also to find out she was taking food off neighbors plate during meals. And putting it away for later, possible to eat or hoard. No idea. Mom will not be truthful on this fact. 

She has been diagnosed with dementia alzheimers.  We have literally taken pretty much everything away. We cannot let her go to the store anymore, and Walmart. Now we have to reimburse the neighbors for all the extras she bought her. 

This is more than dementia. How would you go about dealing with such acts. 
I'm at a loss.","Any chance she genuinely thought she was out of those things? 
My husband is constantly telling me we need to buy things when we don’t. We will be at the store and he’ll say I don’t have any blueberries and I’ll remind him of the giant bag in the fridge. We’ve had many rough shopping trips because even though I reassure him we are not out of..whatever it is…he is very insistent that we are out and need it. I end up having to buy things I know I don’t need just to prevent a melt down. When I show him the pantry stocked he just says “that’s because we got it today at the store.” 
In my experience, for what that’s worth, lol, people with dementia don’t have the brain power at a certain point to be deliberately manipulative or plan things. It’s more like in that moment they genuinely think they need that food..soap…sock..whatever…and react without filters to try to get it.",2022-04-23 11:06:21,ThirstyCoffeeHunter,ua7f19
Dementia,Dementia and Oral Cancer. What to expect?,,"Oral cancer especially with dementia will be very difficult in terms of compliance with taking the medication and what medication they are able to take. If and when they get to the point where they may need hospice the very important question to ask is what is the potential for the person to lose their airway.

One of the common concerns for anyone with oral cancer (throat or mouth), is nutrition. And feeding tubes can own cause more problems for the patient than not.
A friend of my father was diagnosed with cancer of the throat (not sure if it's the same as oral cancer) but it was a very quick developing type of cancer. I think in his specific case it was about a month before he passed from cancer related issues. Not pleasant, but at least it wasn't a long and painful road of suffering. I was relatively young when it happened so I can't say much more than that.
I've tried looking for it and only find treatment options.  Treatment is not an option. 
If anyone had been though this.  What can I expect?",2022-04-22 17:55:49,lucidzebra,u9ptz7
Dementia,Could my father be suffering from early dementia?,"In the past I've noticed every now and then, that my father is a little forgetful here and there. Nothing that was ever worrying (though his mother had dementia that degraded very rapidly).

Today I was talking to my father about the bike that he and I had bought secondhand a month ago from a bike store. He remembered us together being there to buy the bike. He did not remember the bikes brakes being oiled that I had asked them to do. While it was being oiled my dad and I were there looking and he asked a handful of questions about it being done.

Today, roughly a month later, he could not remember it happening. It was after I pried for a while and gave more details about the moment that he slowly started to remember.

He is currently 65, his mother developed dementia at around 75 I believe. Any worries I should have?

I intended for this message to be shorter and more to the point, sorry.","I also ask this because my mother's father suffered from dementia for 7 excruciating years which was incredibly difficult for our family to deal with. The country we live in couldn't house him in a proper carehome during the entirety of COVID, and he passed away just a handful of months ago. We're just putting that horrible time past us and I don't want my mother to go through the same thing again with her husband instead of her father.
You know your father best- but not totally recalling some minor details of an activity a month ago isn’t a red flag to me.  

I think when people have had something traumatic happen on the family- like losing someone to cancer or watching someone painfully decline from dementia, there’s always that sense of Oh no, is it happening again??

Many things can make people forgetful- like poor sleep.  Or thyroid issues.  Keep an eye on it- if you see the forgetfulness becoming a pattern, then I’d have your dad see a doctor.
I am in the same situation as you. I am suspecting that my mom might be going senile.   It's early days. This is hard for me because the forgetfulness/confusion that is typical of dementia is limited with my mom.  It's very mild and hardly noticable.  What caught me off guard earlier this year was her moods and anger issues where she was easily angered. The moods are different every day. Some days she's trying to be my best friend and then other days she won't talk to me.  Just today I found one of my bras hanging up drying amongst her laundry.  She never ever does my laundry.  Last year I was getting ready for an event and I had a selection of good bras but that selection ran low. I found it bizarre. To loose my bras.  There was my mom with a bra that was mine.  We are different sizes by the way.  This is disgusting, the idea that she's wearing my underwear.

It's only now that I can pick apart incidents over the past number of years and join the dots. 

I think she is going senile. I hope I am wrong. I think it's only a matter of time before other symptoms that closely relates to dementia might develop like forgetfulness and confusion.",2022-04-22 17:23:54,Scenturion,u9p513
Dementia,Grandma does not remember eating food,"Not sure if this is the right group, but I really want to seek some opinions or thoughts about the situation. My Grandma is 89, and has dementia. Her memory is really not perfect, she remembers the key details, but oftentimes she forgets what she did during the week. She is under constant care by me and my mum. 

   Moving to the main point, she is very obese. At first, we were really puzzled how she managed to gain such a big amount at this quick rate, since she does not cook, and only eat when we serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  What we found out, was when we are gone, she goes through all the cabinets, pantry, in search for food. I have busted her a few times, and she always says, that either she is hungry or acts like there is no food in her mouth, that she is obviously chewing. So, me and my mum started hiding food.  But it is really frustrating, and hiding a fridge can be a challenge. It is just crazy how she never feels that she had enough, and she can easily eat everything she finds non-stop. The cherry on top is, that when the guests come over, she always says that she hasn’t got anything to eat all day, even though she already had breakfast and lunch. I see how it is taking a toll on my mother, when she really sacrifices a majority of her time to take care of her, and grandma doesn’t even remember. Maybe someone had a similar experience or can share any ideas? Thanks a lot in advance.","Have you thought about baby locks on the cabinets and fridge? I have issues with my mom she try’s to go out the front door and we have one of those covers that just spin around unless you know how to work it. I agree with leaving out healthy snacks for her to pick out. My mom also doesn’t remember sometimes when she has just eaten- I leave her empty plate out until she goes to bed, that seems to help her to see that she ate.
You need to get her to a doctor. This isn't just the mindless snacking of everyday life. Some part of her brain that signals hunger or fullness is no longer working.

In the meantime, buy some low-salt healthy popcorn, the kind you pop at home. Make sure to pick out the kernels. Rice cakes are also good.

They're mostly air so you can spend a lot of time eating without consuming too many calories. But that's just a stopgap to save some money and tears until you can get her to a doctor.
We are having a similar issue with my MIL. I always read that people with dementia lose weight, but she's getting big enough that we worry about being able to move her, even between the two of us. 

The issue is she refuses healthy foods and tears through the house looking for snacks - and when she does find them she hoards them, eating them when we're not looking. She is offered lots of healthy options all day long. I think the only option for us is to remove all that stuff from the house permanently, even though we know she's going to badger us to hell and back about her beloved Pepsi and chips.
I had to put a door on my kitchen because my mother asks for food all day. Many times after just eating. I’ve also caught her eating non-food items. Think dish sponge. Paper towels and such. So the door put a stop to just all day grazing. But it doesn’t stop the constant begging for food saying she hasn’t eaten.
She could also be confusing thirst for hunger. It is a chore to get my Grandma to drink most days. But she also has put on weight. Low activity has definitely helped. But she has a sweet tooth so she might eat a donut and then another because she doesn't know she had one. Like others have stated, locks on the pantry or cabinets. We had to use those when my sibling was little because of raiding for sweets. 
Also trying to set a food routine? Breakfast, mid morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner have helped us. I usually rotate between cheese, nuts, fruit, and she has a glass of milk.
My dad is also constantly ravenous, although losing weight.  We had to take food out of his house (he lived in small detached house behind my sister’s house) because he would feed it to his dog.  His golden retriever was getting very overweight despite many efforts to control his food intake.  My sister took all the food out but would offer him frequent snacks and drinks.  He always accepted, saying he hadn’t eaten all day (not true of course).  We could never give my dad chocolate or anything unsafe for a dog unless we were right there.
That is really frustrating.  I would say start hiding only the sweets and snacks, and put out healthier stuff like meat, veggies, and fruit where she can eat it, that will be better for her AND more filling so she won't be able to eat non-stop like she could with just carbs.
Go to a doctor. There are a lot of new medications with few side effects that could help her (like Semaglutide).
I’ve noticed recently that my dad is eating multiple additional meals throughout the day. He cooks for himself (but also eats spoiled food) and doesn’t remember that he’s eaten dinner. Stock piling food has been an issue since he got sick, and now he is also addicted to the social interaction he gets from grocery shopping so it’s become a big issue. He’s alone during the day. He also doesn’t drink anything so I’ve been working more on getting him more drinks he likes that are available and everywhere.
My Mom is like this.  We have to hide food from her otherwise she will gorge herself on anything that she finds appealing, which is usually junk food.  She's already overweight and  is still gaining and it's getting hard for me to care for her.  She doesn't need lifting up (I wouldn't be able to do it) yet, thankfully, but when it comes to cleaning herself after the bathroom, I am having to help with that more and it's awful.   


Good luck, OP.  I hope either child proofing the cupboards will help or that her doctor can help you.",2022-04-22 17:05:20,Karo1ina99,u9oqcs
Dementia,POA situation driving me absolutely nuts,"I have been having the absolutely WORST time trying to use my POA to manage my dad's affairs after he ended up in the hospital and then a memory care unit. I am starting to think it's ME doing something wrong but I'm wondering if anybody else has experienced this or maybe has tips?

I would say about half the places I contact with a POA document either lose, 'never receive,' delay processing until I contact them about 10 times, or outright reject my request to be added to an account due to some stupid small technical error that's usually on them. Every place has their own specific submission process, form, letter with specific information I need to send, etc., so I am careful to ask exactly what the process is before actually submitting.

I have spent an unbelievable amount of time over the phone and sending letters just following up on things (I'm talking like 10+ hours per week, which HAS to mostly be during work hours), only to be told by generic customer service reps that there's 'nothing they can do' and they 'can't transfer me to the legal department' or even transfer me to a supervisor. I also will receive generic form letters 2-3 weeks after submission of docs that basically say, ""in reference to you POA: nope, we didn't do anything. Please submit some *other* thing nobody told you about and wait another 3-4 weeks."" There is also the problem that it seems like in complex organizations, one branch will accept the POA but that's not the branch you needed to talk to, so you have to submit ANOTHER POA and then wait another two weeks, before you are then told that the second branch you *definitely submitted a copy to* never received anything.

I mean, this thing is a legal document. I have a valid authority to be added to these accounts in a timely manner and these companies are straight up interfering with my ability to manage his affairs. I have been trying for two months to get access to his primary asset account and it's now interfering with my ability to pay some of his bills. No matter who I talk to at that company, they can't help and they give me a new set of directions to 'try resubmitting.'

I try to remain patient and give each person I talk to the benefit of the doubt and the chance to help me, but I feel like I am getting straight stonewalled out of this with no options. It's such a weird form of helplessness! I also try to tug at heartstrings due to his situation and this can sometimes gain sympathy but never gains any competence from anybody.

How have you all managed this ridiculous set of hoops, on top of the whole your-parent-has-dementia thing?!","Are you able to talk to an elder law attorney by any chance? If your dad has enough assets, the costs of the attorney can come out of his accounts. I bring this up, because it might be time to pursue Guardianship/Conservatorship of your father. This will make things much easier to manage and there will be court orders basically telling these various organizations that they must allow you to access your father's accounts. Some entities do not accept POA/Guardianships such as Social Security, but what I ended up doing was giving a phone interview with someone and they confirmed that I was my grandmother's legal representative.

The other option is to get a formal psych evaluation done, and have the neuropsych type out a letter saying that your dad is unable to handle his own affairs. This, in addition to the POA, may be enough documentation for the various legal departments confirming your identity and intent.

I have definitely had to navigate this, so I sympathize...some legal departments are much more strict than others, for good reason I believe. I'm sure in recent years, they've encountered a lot of people trying to take advantage of elderly family members/patients, so they're being extra cautious to protect their clients.
I had the same experience with my wife’s power of attorneys.

It took almost a year (combination of unclear instructions and mistakes on their part) to finally get her medical POA uploaded into her Kaiser account. It had to be uploaded into their system for me to be able to act as her healthcare agent. 

Do you know how hard it is to get a dementia patient who is hysterical about taking pills, to give admin, nurses and doctors permission every time to speak with me? 

A couple months later it disappeared and I had to start all over.
I don’t necessarily think you need to get guardianship if you have both a financial POA and a healthcare POA. I have been in your shoes with staff who don’t know what to do regarding a POA. Which is shocking because I know it can’t be the first time they’ve dealt with it. Hope it gets better.
Had the same thing. Now I am waiting for the court date (next monrh) to become court appointed. 
It stinks that my mom's certified wishes are not considered legal.

Texas.
Yup.  I've had places lose the POA multiple times, after it had been faxed, sent on paper, sent again...  I've had places tell me that their agency never accepts POAs, only guardianships.  I've had places tell me that it is their policy never to accept out-of-state POAs.

It's a nightmare.  My brother has finally decided to go through the pain and expense to formally become my mother's legal guardian; he'd been delaying because he didn't want her to be distressed/infuriated by the process.",2022-04-22 14:39:35,thoughtdotcom,u9lj6n
Dementia,Lost my mom at 24. Question about gene test..,"Sorry for the long story. There is a summary of my question and a TLDR at the bottom.

  I want to give some backstory. My mom got early onset Alzheimer's/dementia and over the course of 8years I watched her completely forget who she was, who I was. Near the end before we put her in a care home I was changing her diapers. She would talk to her reflection in the mirror like it was her friend. I'd come out in the middle of the night sometimes to find her just standing there staring into darkness or facing a corner. It was really unnerving. She started getting symptoms when I was about 16 or so and she died when I was 23, my younger brother only 18.  Her dad died of Alzheimer's but his didn't set in until he was around 80years old. Her symptoms started when she was about 40. She always said she wouldn't die of that disease and technically, she didn't. She progressed really rapidly in the care home and In her last few days she became violent, attacking other residents in their sleep. So she was sent to a psych and they prescribed her some medication. Well this medication made her really dizzy and a couple days later she fell and hit her head. She died of brain trauma/internal bleeding. So her statement did stand true in the end, she didn't let that horrible disease be the thing to take her out.. although i believe she died long before her physical body did anyways.. Now none of that is really the point of this post. Since she had early onset that means she carried a specific gene that caused it. This is hereditary so me and my younger brother have a 50/50 chance of carrying it. This gene can be found in a DNA/Gene test.  If I carry this specific early onset gene it is pretty much 100% that I will get early onset Alzheimer's. If i don't carry it there's still always the chance I can get it later in life but it's not a certain thing.

TLDR:  If I don't carry the early onset gene Id get some bit of peace of mind. But if I do carry it there are 2 cons and 2pros that come to mind.
 Con #1- it will most certainly effect  health or life insurance right?
 Con #2- I feel like I'd psych myself out and think about it all the time, worry if any small thing I forget is symptoms setting in etc.
 Pro #1) I could likely start trying tests studies treatments & prevention methods early on and 
Pro #2) I would try harder than I have been to live my life to the absolute fullest knowing that I could die in my 40s. I already live by this to an extent as i know every day isn't guaranteed but I'd definitely spend a lot more time doing the things I love in the next 10years or so.

 I know in the end it comes down to what I want to do but my question for you is, would you want to know?","Lost my dad when I was 23, he was 53. It was a genetic disease, both my uncles are showing (heavy) symptoms now as well. I was the first one of the family to do the test, I couldn't live with the uncertainty of not knowing if I would show Alz symptoms before I was 50. My younger brother also got his test last year.

I tested negative for the gene, my brother tested positive. In short, this means I feel really guilty because my brother is already halfway through his 'good' years. Also, I am of course happy that I am not developing Alz at such a young age.

My younger brother is, obviously, devastated. He is hopeful though, since he started a very intensive program in which all sort of tests are run on him. The type of Alz we have in our family is a very 'pure' form, so it is key in finding a cure. 

Good luck with your choice, you are in for a ride either way
My Mom died of Early Onset Alz at 63 after having it for years. She died of late stage…forgetting how to walk, talk, chew and swallow. It sucked. I’ve had genetic testing and have a low chance of Early Onset Alz but a chance of Alz that happens with age…..however…I take good care of myself and take Dietary Supplements, etc. Having knowledge about how your body works, genetic or otherwise, is empowering.",2022-04-22 12:55:58,stayinguplatecrying,u9j9o7
Dementia,Should I go along with with it?,"My grandfather (I'll call him Pa) just got diagnosed. Stage 4. He's on home health care now. This man is everything in my life. He was like my father. He is doing OK I think. He likes to stare at the TV and then he will have ""hallucinations"" of 5 little girls standing next to him and he will talk to them like they are his grandkids. Then he'll imagine his best friend (who he hasn't seen in years and is also in poor health) and have conversations with him. He gets kind of upset when my Nana tells him he is just seeing things and his eyes and mind are overcompensating from going blind. 

She is just now finding out his diagnosis too and from my understanding let's him see them now. Should I go along with it? Like, don't let him know there is no one there?","Yes, \*as long as\* the hallucination or delusion, by itself, isn't causing him distress, then don't argue. You don't necessarily have to fully engage in the sense of pretending you see them, too, but you don't want to argue with his reality, either. As you've seen, it just upsets him to be told those people aren't really there - and, I mean, if you think about it, if you were just having a nice chat with your brother, how would you feel if somebody told you you were actually talking to a wall? Probably embarassed, angry, scared, etc.

It's different, of course, if it's an upsetting delusion/hallucination or causing him to behave in ways that put him and/or others in danger. Then you have to act, and those are tricky as hell to navigate, so hopefully it won't get to that point for you. But if he's just enjoying a nice chat with the nice invisible ladies, let it go.
With dementia, the person lives entirely in the moment... they can't make plans, and they generally can't remember most things, either. So your only role with them is to make them comfortable in this moment... and the next moment... and the next moment.

He isn't going to get better. Dementia only gets worse, but at different rates for different people.

If he's happy talking to the children, there's no harm in that and feel free to engage with him in this fantasy. He's happy. He's enjoying himself for the moment. Don't steal that from him.

People with dementia know something is wrong, but they generally can't figure out why they feel odd, out of place, confused, or just ""off"". So they get frustrated, and can spiral into anger, sadness, etc.

So if he's enjoying the moment, let him have it. There are few ""good"" times with dementia, so when he's not spinning in frustration or anger over his diminished capabilities, go with it! This is now improv theater and you need to react to the reality your grandfather is creating.

**Anecdote**: My dad's Alzheimers with Lewy Body diagnosis is pretty new, and he's still pretty good most of the time. But a stressful situation a couple weeks ago sent his dementia into overdrive and made him hallucinate that I was his best friend from childhood (Mike; who passed away almost 10 years ago). My Dad then proceeded to have this amazing conversation with me (playing Mike) reminiscing about the shenanigans these two troublemakers got up to when they were kids. His eyes lit up and he was SO HAPPY to talk to his old friend Mike again!!

I was honored to be able to give him those moments of happiness.

I hope you can do the same for your grandfather.
As a nurse, I don't go alone with hallucinations or delusions, but on the same token I present what I see in a way (as best possible) that I'm not arguing with the person... such as ""I believe you are seeing what you see, but this is what I see \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"".",2022-04-22 11:59:22,borderlinebad,u9hzd2
Dementia,Hallucinations and venting,"Its been 3 years since my father's diagnose. He is 65 only. I am so sorry he never had the chance to live his 60's he went from 60 to 80 years old.

Its been downhill since then, he is on some medications to chill him a bit and get better sleep. 

I have been noticing he is beginning to have some kind of mild hallucinations. Last night he woke up in the middle of the night asking my mom why there was a person there and why they were in the kitchen while such person is just a frame above the bed of leaves and they have been sleeping in my room as they are staying this week in my place and I will return with them to their home for some weeks.

He is quiet most of the time, interactions have decreased significantly in the past months. I mean, he is not able to make a coherent phrase anymore. He stutters some words and its difficult to understand what he is saying, when he does sometimes comes from a weird observation, like trying to relate the TV controller with a little monkey there. Nonsense.

Its clear he is losing his consciousness day by day. At least here he is not wandering that much anymore, he sits or lays in the couch and stays there. His eyes...his eyes are lost in space. He doesn't hear or understand clearly when someone is addressing to him and he needs help to conduct him where he needs to go. He is totally dependent in everything, even baths he can't do it properly in his own. This wasn't happening when I last saw him in January. 

Sometimes I wonder if he is becoming blind because he cant see the most obvious things. My apartment is small, like 570 sq feet, two rooms and a bathroom between, he ALWAYS misses the bathroom. He goes all the way to the laundry area or one of the rooms to pee. Obviously the bathroom is damn small, and he is still not sure where to pee and even aimed with his hands to be sure pointing it to the side of the toilette. How is that possible...

Its depressing...very depressing. I feel some guilty for choosing to stay in the city while my parents and my brother (27, I am 28) lives 1 hour drive (I don't own vehicles so I cant visit them that often, I intend to do so soon  as long as I find some way or even save to buy a motorbike). I mean, WFH since the pandemic hit and living by myself for 5 years now, I have choose this life before his disease so I could gain some independence and find my own way and to be not a burden for them, I have a girlfriend I want to marry soon so I need to build my life and not worry my mom, I guess its the right thing? If she needed my help she might ask, and  I am glad my brother lives there to help them out. As I see them every 2 months, this means I only see frames of my fathers illness and its always getting  worse. My mom and brother are not that shocked as I am because they are there. My mom has been dealing better now, she has accepted that correcting him will not help, just comply and chill him when asking about going home or seeing his wife or dead relatives.

He is not able to recognize any of us. I wonder what goes through his head...I needed to offmychest this because as much as I try to accept this as life the way it is and this is just one way to die, when I stop to think about it I just want to cry and I do sometimes, a little, because we need to keep going. I feel bad because we werent really close all of our lives. I mean, he was always there and provided us all, he did a wonderful job as father, we just didnt click when we grew up so our relation were just ok enough, I wish we had way more father-son moments as I see others doing. Now its too late. However, I am glad I see a lot of in me from him, I am a fraction of the men he was and I am glad for that.

As if the disease is not enough to burden us all we need to mind and deal with the judicial matters and battle for the right to not pay IRS anymore. 

So sorry...We are no that religious but I know he had faith in God as I do, and I am glad I once asked him if he believed in God ans Jesus Christ as his savior and he does. So I know he is going to be saved and go to Heaven peacefully. I don't pray a lot...once in a while but when I do I always ask Him to relief my father's pain and give peace in his heart, the same for us and strength to deal with all that, I feel better afterwards and thats the way he have been living.

I wish you all the best dealing with this. You are not alone","I have early onset dementia and I'm only 61.  I don't believe that your father is becoming blind.  It may be that his brain may not be able to assess his reality very well when he focuses on something.  He may just be getting confused because his brain isn't forming good neural connections now.  I get confused and lost sometimes when I come out of a store that I've been to many times and get lost driving home because my brain is not telling my mind what to do.  I also don't talk much myself at all anymore because it's difficult for me to form what I need to say.  Interacting with people causes me stress which is why I don't talk much anymore because I don't know what to say.  Deep inside though, I'm aware of what's going on with me and that I'm losing my ability to relate to the outside world.  I believe that deep inside your father, he's aware of his deficits and at some level he is aware of what's going on.
I'm so sorry that you and your family is going thru this. My mother passed in March 2020 from complications from dementia. I do have to say that I had the chance to visit her a few times a week because of her living in a assisted living home only 15 minutes from my house. She recognized me and knew my name until the day she passed. I miss her so much. Any questions just pm me. Good luck and peace.",2022-04-22 11:54:04,alioshazov,u9hv71
Dementia,Is my wife showing signs? I'm not sure what to do... I'm not even sure if I'm in the right place....,"I’m posting this to get some advice on what I should do.

Should I try and get my wife to the doctor or neurologist?

She is having very bad short term memory loss, loss of balance, and tremors.

She is also experiencing muscle/joint stiffness/pain/weakness

She gets these very bad intense headaches, which in her own words ""makes her feel out of it"" they last for a couple minutes then go away.

When she laughs the left and right side at the base of her skull starts hurting really bad, she says it burns almost or that someone is pushing super hard on her skull and squeezing.

She has lost weight without trying.

She barely eats because she feels full fast.

For a while we thought her memory loss was due to anxiety and depression, but she has been on medication, and it has been controlled and getting a lot better. Her memory did not improve.

She had high liver enzymes one time, so us and her doctor chalked up her memory loss and tremors to her liver. It’s not because of her liver, all her bloodwork came back and it’s all normal.

Tested her thyroid, normal.

Last bloodwork showed no vitamin deficiencies. 

She is a smoker, vape throughout the day and marijuana at night.

Normal sleep

History of concussions when she was a teenager

She has had memory problems, but now it’s getting much worse and more noticeable.

Her memory loss consists of:

Asking a question then a few minutes later she asks the same question with no recollection of asking it the first time.

She will be talking and then can’t think of the word she was trying to say and she gets frustrated. She cries sometimes because of it and sometimes she will hurt herself (she smacks her forehead a lot when she can’t remember)

She gets words mixed up and puts two different words together.

She came out once asking where the sceeezers were. Then she says scissors, then she lets out a loud Fu\*\* and yelled TWEEZERS

She has little cups where she holds her makeup everything has a place. Specifically, her mascara, it has its own cup. One day she was wandering around looking for her mascara and she just couldn’t find it. She put it in a drawer, not the cup. She had no recollection of putting it there. Another time she’s looking for her mascara again. It ended being in the toothbrush and toothpaste holder.

She forgets appointments and important dates.

She had an appointment the other day at 11:15. She put it in her phone, work calendar, it was on her paper for the doctor, on her paper calendar, and on her doctors portal. Everything said 11:15. Well she forgets, and she goes at 11:45. She said she read 11:15 as 11:45 and she even questioned the front desk lady and didn’t believe her that her appt was at 11:15.

She’s having a hard time following recipes, she’s just very slow at it now.

She will be talking, and she tries to say a word and it starts out as mumbo jumbo she can’t grasp on to saying it correctly and she ends up stuttering trying to get the word out. She lets out a big UGH and I have to say the word for her then she can say it.

Whenever she gets up to go get something, she stops, looks confused and forgets what she was doing and must ask me what she was doing/getting.

She walks all around the house just to grab one thing. She forgets what she’s getting.

She once forgot that she let our dogs outside, until she woke up to barking and scratching at 2am.

Mid-sentence she will just stop and pause. She forgets what she was talking about, and she must ask me what we were just talking about.

She barely remembers to take her medication, we are close to getting her a pill box because when she does remember to take her medication on her own, later in the day she’ll forget if she took it or not and then is at risk for double dosing.

The majority of the time she doesn’t know what day it is, she will say it’s Friday but really it’s like Wednesday.

She repeats her stories about her day at least like 3 times a day after getting home.

She doesn’t remember the day before; she has a hard time thinking about what we had for dinner the day before.

She barely remembers what she does the day before.

She is a math wizard, but lately she’s having trouble calculating simple numbers like single digit numbers.

She has expressed to me that she can’t remember her schedule. She has a time sheet to fill out and she can never remember what time she got to work and what time she left. She also forgets to write down what time she gets to work once she gets there.

She has had tremors for a year or so, but they are very noticeable now. Her hand shakes uncontrollably and it spreads to her whole arm sometimes. Her leg will also have a big tremor. These tremors happen at rest.

Her balance is not great.

She’ll be standing up straight and just randomly loses her balance.

She runs into the corners of walls because she just doesn’t move out of the way quick enough? Or she thinks she’s moved enough out of the way, but she ends up just ramming her shoulder into the wall.

We are talking about getting a bar for the shower, because she has said when she closes her eyes to wash her face, she gets very dizzy and loses her balance.

It’s not safe. She has had some close calls of almost falling out of the shower because she just randomly loses her balance.

What should I do? Should I be worried?","Not a doctor, but have you taken this list to the doctor? Have she had any brain scans? X-ray, CT or MRI? I’d start there.
Not a doctor but sounds like she have Parkinsons with dementia.  Yes, get her in to see a neurologist.  Losing her balance and falling can be very dangerous especially if she hits her head or breaks a bone.  You have a list of very specific areas of concerns so be sure and make neuro appointment and attend the appointment with your wife.
All of it matters. Make mention to the neurologist.
Go to your primary care physician first.  MOST insurance companies require a referral to see a specialist.  It could just be meniere's disease.
Yes, you should be very worried. Book an appointment with a neurologist immediately and make sure they do a full workup, including an MRI or CAT scan. And if your doctor isn’t worried or is dragging their feet, see a better doctor ASAP. Seriously, I don’t want to overly frighten you, but do not delay on this!
My husband has Lewy Body dementia with Parkinsonism. LBD and Parksinson’s are caused by the same mechanism. You can check out r/Parkinsons and r/YOPD

That said, neurologist ASAP! This doesn’t sound right. Dementia should not be the first thing they check. Even the concussions shouldn’t be causing this. Yes, an MRI can change in 2-3 years. There are other types of scans they may need to do. 

Please be a fierce advocate for your wife’s care. She probably can’t do it herself in her current condition. Some of these symptoms sound stroke-related. Insist they check everything. Time is of the essence.
Has she ever had a head injury, even when she was little? My mom has a buildup of scar tissue in her brain from a surgery 30 years ago causing the same symptoms,  along with seizures and mood swings. Definitely get that MRI, asap. Whatever is happening might be easier to treat since she's so young.
My wife has MS. Alot of the same symptoms. Get to an neurologist and they will do an mri of the brain, thoracic and lower lumbar. The mri showed lesions and the final test was a spinal tap for fluid which confirmed the MS. She was diagnosed in 2008 and she is doing great. She has been on 1 medication the last 14 years and she has been in remission. Please pm me with any questions. Btw, she was diagnosed at 39 years old.
See a neurologist who specializes in dementia and I am certain they will either figure it out or direct you to the correct specialist.
Sure, it's possible. I hope you find the answers that you are looking for and her symptoms disappear.
yes get her to a neurologist for an evaluation. Some of those symptoms sound more like Parkinsons than dementia to me. I hope so. Parkinsons is extremely treatable.   


Good luck to you both!
I know it's tough, however she needs medical attention to confirm or rule out stroke, TIA, etc
Multiple TIAS can lead to cognitive impairment 
Get mom a full neuro, physical workup.
There are resources for mom once  dianosed
Good luck to you.
TIA? Mini stroke? Needs medical attention ASAP
Those are similar symptoms to ALS.
What ever doctor you talk to, bring a list of symptoms with you. Even if you print out this post for them if that's easier. When you are at a doctors appointment it is easy to forget certain symptoms while you are there even if you don't have memory issues. I find if I write it out while at home I can give them a full list plus any questions that I may have regarding my mothers care. Saves a lot of time for both of us.
This sounds very worrisome and I'm sorry you're both going thru this!  If she is 25, you should get her to see a movement disorder specialist and read up on functional neurological disorder.  A general neurologist lacks the training to diagnose her correctly.  This will probably end up being the diagnosis once they hopefully rule out other bad stuff.

From what you've said this seems pretty significant.  
Does she have a psychiatrist?  

Are your aware of any severe trauma or stress in her life? There tends to be triggers for this but can have occurred at any time in life.

Please look into finding a movement disorder specialist though as this is the best way to figure out what's going on.",2022-04-22 10:45:20,Adventurous_Corner94,u9gcbn
Dementia,"Help, is this dementia?","My mom lives with us. She’s only 67 but after losing her job 3 years ago she has rapidly declined. She seems much slower to speak with, it’s almost frustrating listening to her talk .. searching for the words.. sometimes decides she doesn’t even know what she’s saying and says never mind


Recently (1 month ago) she started chatting through Facebook with a scammer / catfish that had convinced her he was a well known professional athlete (I’m leaving his name out) just let it be known he is exceptionally famous and 28 years old . She began a romantic relationship with this person believing it was the athlete.. after coaxing her to deposit a couple of fake checks (she didn’t know of course) and sending portions of money back to the tune of over $10,000 she finally realized and listened to her family and admitted it was not the athlete and was a scammer. She felt embarrassed and very sad/ upset. Her bank wanted tons of money and she just scraped by on social security. Days later she starts another romantic relationship with a person pretending to be a semi famous musician. She talks about it at first then begins to hide it from everyone. Her finances are absolute chaos so I have the small few hundred dollars she has left to her name. She asks for $100 to open a new bank account because the old ones all closed on her. She then proceeded to go buy gift cards and send them to this new scammer. She talks to him as if they are in love and will be married soon.. after two weeks of chatting and of course he’s wanting money from her and asks several times and tells her to ask me for it. Clearly I anyone thinking rationally he is pressuring her for money and manipulating her blatantly.

She claims she knows this is wrong but she also will lash out and scream at anyone who tries to confront her about this issue. It’s strange to see someone that was considered highly intelligent and successful so far gone from reality she believes these scammers ridiculous stories for needing money and will harm her own financial well being, lie to her family and even lash out in anger when confronted.

I don’t know if this is psychological or cognitive or what! I need to get her some help. Any advice??","Have you been to an Elder Attorney?  If not then that is your first step.  BTW many people, without cognitive issues, fall for these kind of scams.  Anyway, go see an elder attorney.  They can explain what you can and can't do and get POA's set up that you may need in the future and maybe help you determine if she needs a guardianship.  Also check with her bank, ask what type of POA they would accept in order for you to take over control of her bank account. Right now there is not really anything you can do.  It's her money, she has access, she can throw it away if she wants.  You can try restricting on social media, make her account private, maybe talk to her doctor to see if any medication would help.  Are there any senior centers near you?  Many have adult day care programs where she could go and socialize during the day. Maybe if she makes new friends and gets involved with activities trough a senior center she would be less likely to need interactions with strangers.  Good luck.
You need to take her to the doctor and ask for a neuropsych evaluation
Will she give you access to her FB account so you can adjust her privacy settings so that her profile is not visible in searches?

I’d probably also discuss getting a POA set up. 

Will she go to the dr for an evaluation?  In my grandmother’s case, she would never discuss these symptoms with her dr so I called her dr and told her what I was seeing.
She needs to see a doctor. It could be depression or a ton of different things completely unrelated to dementia.
Thanks for responding, I appreciate it all. I assumed online scams are pretty common this just seemed next level considering she is nearly 70 and had been convinced she was in an online relationship with an NBA superstar who suddenly had “bank issues” and needed her to send money for him and his charity. 
Then once it all fell apart to jump right into another identical situation with what she believed is a famous musician that she’s convinced is suddenly in love with her over the internet and he ALSO has bank problems and needs her to send money. This all starters a month ago and she went from one scammer to the next within days of having her bank account go negative $13,000. 
I just couldn’t ever imagine her to be someone like this, very successful in the corporate world for 30 years, home owner etc.. 
it’s the most bizarre situation I’ve been in for a long time",2022-04-22 08:22:40,usernameUNKOWNSYSTEM,u9ddvs

He doesn’t remember conversations we’ve had.

What should I do? He doesn’t have that much money to be buying all this stuff.

He has no need for a laptop. I think he just wanted one because I was talking about how I couldn’t set mine up as workmen are to put in floor boards but I’ve been waiting 7 months for insurance to sort it out.","Time for a doctor's appointment.  This is very common. :(
You need a POA and to take away the credit and debit cards.
Happened with my mom too! They blame the device instead of their own health problems and think buying a new one will fix it.
I would love to throw away my husbands IPhone and Mac .   He used to know how to work these now he doesn't and he is making me nuts.  If he changes his Apple ID password one more time I think I will go insane. He bought a Windows laptop and can't get that to work so is staying with the Mac much to my chagrin.  It is really hard, he doesn't want to give these up and I am not willing to take them away just yet.  Is there anyway to get his credit/debit card away from him? I am not sure what you can substitute for the Mac because he has lost the ability to figure these things out. I would just concentrate on getting control of his finances so he can't keep spending money he doesn't have.  Have you been to an elder attorney and gotten financial and health POA's for him?  If not, you should make appointment with an one, they can explain what you can and can't do, and get POA's set up.  POA's don't solve all of the problems but might help in this case.  Good luck.
Trouble with technology after years of being able to use them was an early sign for us. I remember when this began and I would joke that it was a good thing he had a wife who (at the time) was an IT professional. I was constantly fixing the printer, laptop, phone when he couldn’t get something to work. I have no idea how he messed things up the way he did. I now refuse to own a printer because I got tired of him printing things not needed and then me having to make it work all the time and constantly replace ink. I tell him all printing must be done at FedEx now. I’ve seen his photos on his phone and it’s full of pics he takes of his computer screen. 😂
My dad's thing was buying another thing because he couldn't keep track of the one he already had. I think I have an inherited tape measure in every room of my house now.
Happened with my mom. Could barely use a TV remote, and thought she could learn a computer. Luckily she finally accepted it and lost interest.
Mine buys WIERD shit, then uses it constantly for his strange projects. I shall explain:

The new thing is a laser meter for calculating distance. We now know PRECISELY how big his yard is, verified against the title docs.

Now there's little reflector stakes outlining HIS property to the .75 feet.

It's bizarro world.
This is just a minor example, because my mother was already living in a retirement home and I had pretty strict control of her finances, but she still would get junk mail and respond to it: she bought a $50 book called “How To Save Money Around The House.”
Tactical matters first: Do you have an Apple store nearby? They can help him get his new machine up and running. If there's no store close enough, Apple phone support may be able to help regardless. Once he's up and running, you may want to make sure he's using Keychain and Safari to help with password management.

Health and financial POAs are a good idea (as is scheduling an appointment with your GP and asking for a referral to a neurologist). As I understand it, a POA isn't  going to help with the spending issues though because it doesn't allow you restrict/control an adult's use of money unless they are incapacitated and irresponsible purchases don't fall into that category. You'd need guardianship for that level of control, I believe.
I bought my dad a smartphone (his first ever, a Samsung A02s so not pricey) a year ago, but he's at the stage where he occasionally uses the functions by himself. My mum dropped her cheapo smartphone yesterday; it's a few years old and I'm thinking of buying her the same as dad's, so they can help each other (her dementia isn't anywhere near as far gone or diagnosed).
I think it’s normal. My grandma bought a new laptop because hers “broke,” aka she forgot the password. Then she remembered the password before the new laptop arrived, so she plugged the new laptop in in the office and never touched it, because using it would cause it to slow down or the battery to go bad ??

She also declared an iPad broken because she didn’t know her Apple ID to set anything up. Didn’t replace that one, just accepted she didn’t have an iPad anymore until one of us found it in a drawer and asked about it. Easy fix. Her email provider is constantly changing the password on her too, how dare they.

It’s sad, she’s never been extremely tech savvy but she’s a smart person. She should be able to do these things. She used to be able to. She retired in the mid 00s and used excel and other basic computing things proficiently. But it seemed like this was the first skill to go.
My mom's bought 5 new smartphones because she can't figure out how to turn the volume up so ""it must be broken"". She bought a new pair of hearing aids online (non prescription even though she NEEDS prescription) because her old ones ""broke"" (they were dirty and simply needed cleaning). Same with TV remotes, computer chairs, power tools, etc. She also buys everything in multiples or in bulk because she shops exclusively on Amazon since she's immobile, so she's become a hoarder. She's moving in with us this summer and I'm not sure how to get it under control because I refuse to allow my living space to be filled to the brim with unopened amazon bags and boxes.
A brand new top of the line Subaru Forester. He cannot figure it out but still thinks he can drive.
My mom has done this. She wasted a lot of money buying things then throwing them away days later when she realized she wasn't really going to use it. She lost the ability to drive 3 years ago, can't figure out online shopping, and has trouble understanding credit cards anymore so her money problems have improved a lot. At some point your dad will likely lose the ability to buy things as well. In the meantime consider getting in touch with a social worker specializing in elder care issues. It may be possible to get listed as his legal guardian which will give you the ability to block purchases and manage his money. My husband had to do this with his brother who had a severe mental illness impacting his ability to live independently.
My mother. For sure.
Lol. I do this for my mom because I still have some lingering denial about what is happening. Maybe she needs a phone with bigger buttons. Oh, she just needs a new light over here. Maybe a different remote will help her operate the TV.
Boy. I'm glad my mom is afraid of technology. 

I have trouble with her giving money to people who call on the phone. Sometimes I catch her in time to stop her, but other times I don't know who she gave to until the charge hits the credit card. 

And of course she will tell you that she NEVER gives money to people.on the phone, never ever.
If you have financial power of attorney you could set his daily spend limit very low? I can set a limit of $500 for my Mum's card. 

Also helps that she taps to pay everything. Anything over $200 she needs to enter a pin. Can't remember pin though.

Can't help with the spending on what they don't need though. My mum goes to thrift shops and buys so much. I donate clothes back and she buys them again.
As Seen On TV was my mothers friend before we figured out she had dementia. I have been ""gifted"" Alien Tape, an egg pan, cell phone holder for my car, the list goes on and on. Finally got to the point where something would arrive (she has a mom in law apt with us) and I would refuse/return it.

Dementia,"Need info, serious help",My grandmother has mid to late stage dementia and Alzheimer’s and we’re trying to place her in a facility that can provide the care she needs since we cannot. The only facility near us that can provide the level of care she needs is quoting us about $3000 more than we can afford. Does anyone have any resources that would help us financially? She doesn’t qualify for Medical. And board and care isn’t able to provide the level of care she needs. I’m desperate for any help because we’re running out of time,"Run don't walk to an Elder Attorney.  The attorney will know what options are available and how to use/protect assets as well as assist you in applying for medicaid if appropriate.  Don't try and figure this stuff out on your own, it gets complicated.
Unfortunately if you can't afford that, and she has assets, you'll most likely have to pay out of pocket until she qualifies for Medicaid. Even then it's probably another $2K out of pocket. Don't sell or transfer ownership of any property until you know all of your options. Medicaid will allow her to keep her home if it's in her name and her primary home. I would consult an attorney.
Are you in USA?  If she or her spouse served during war, she may be eligible for the VA aid and attendance benefit. If you think she may qualify-contact your local VA office. It was a horrible process, but it at least gave us around 1200 per month that didn’t have to come out of pocket. Sorry you’re going through this and I know your pain very well. :(",2022-04-21 22:44:09,Interesting-Crazy-99,u94b0n
Dementia,Dementia Caregivers,"Hello, I’m hoping to get some insight on how my girlfriend and her family can get financial assistance with getting her grandmother (patient) and her grandfather into a long term care facility. 

Her grandma is in her 80’s and has SEVERE dementia. At this point she remembers nothing, and is verbally and physically abusive. Last summer she fell and broke her hip, that lead to a horrible few months of recovery. In the last 2 months she’s fallen 3 times and hurts herself constantly. Since she’s in pain it only makes her attitude much much much worse. She is absolutely unable to care for herself of course, and my GF’s family cannot care for her by themselves. They’re not equipped to deal with her at all. Her grandpa is in his 90’s and constantly is the target of her anger and abuse and when GF and her mom try to intervene, they then get the brunt of it. His health is also starting to slip further and further as this goes on. 

GF’s mom is a single mother and a teacher and GF is an admin assistant at a school so their funds are very very limited. I offer to help in anyway I can, house work, yard work anything, but I can’t help much financially either. 

At this point they don’t know what to do and believe there are absolutely no options out there. Even the thought of splitting up the grandparents scares them for her grandpa’s sake. What options are there for helping pay for a memory care facility. Insurance, non-profits, is something like Go-FundMe or anything like that the best bet?
Any advice can make a big difference for them so I welcome anything y’all can think of. 

Thank you","Biggest question: what are the finances of the grandmother with dementia? That’s the first question.
Google Elder Options for your state and call them. They will help them.

Dementia,Incontinence problems?,Does anyone have incontinence problems from their brain damage?  I do.,"Not personally, but it's extremely common with dementia, or brain injury.
My Mum became totally incontinent overnight. We don't know what happened, but she was fine when I saw her the day before. She was suddenly not making sense and was completely incontinent the next day. It was not a stroke, but her Alzheimers ramped up for some reason. She can hold a conversation again, but the incontinence remains.",2022-04-21 18:42:57,Becksalright,u8zm9w
Dementia,HELP,"My mom has an important appt w her neurologist next week that I’ve been waiting months for. The neurologist will review the neuropsych exam that was administered to my mom several months ago, where it was indicated that she has vascular dementia w the possibility of Lewy Body Dementia. The neurologist will further evaluate her and likely recommend some kind of imaging studies for diagnostic purposes. I have been temporarily living w my mom at her request to help care for her (she has other health issues) and her cognitive health worsens by the day. This is not an appt she can miss, but now she’s saying she will not go and I am beside myself. All of my energy goes into being a caretaker for her, her dog, her house. I left my life behind (several states away) to care for her and my mental health is suffering majorly as a result. (I have mental health support via weekly therapy & a psychiatrist). I have no job atm, no friends, no money, nada. Just a desire to see my mom get properly evaluated and diagnosed so that she can get the treatment she needs and I can move on w my life. I desperately need to make sure she goes to see her neurologist next week, despite her resistance and denial that anything is wrong w her cognitive health. I’m feeling so helpless, and hopeless, like I’ve been wasting my life caring for a thankless old lady. I guess I don’t even know what I’m even asking here, other than maybe for prayers/supportive thoughts. I’m trying so hard to keep it together, help my mom, apply for jobs, try to meet friends, be healthy…but I’m at a breaking point here.","My father has to see doctors all the time, and he constantly says he's not going. I just act based on the idea that we're going. And when it comes time to get dressed and head to the car, I just keep moving forward, answering his I'm-not-going-s with gentle we-have-to-s and explain the situation as many times as is necessary (not that he understands, but it moves along the process), as I put on his jacket and gloves.

It's heartbreaking that I/we have to sort of ignore his wishes in order to care for his overall health. But, if we didn't, what little time is left would be taken by some other more acute ailment.

My mother is having the most difficulty with it, though (understandably). My father was extremely intelligent and it's hard for all of us to see the decline. But, sometimes she talks to him still expecting a rational response and gets frustrated when he has different/""crazy"" reactions, or can't remember what she just explained. She still wants him to be able to handle their bills so she just lets him sit in his office, a room lined wall to wall with books that he used to study and now wants to throw away (he has that throw-away impulse thing), and stare at the statement of some account that he already paid and tries to pay three or four more times, unsealing envelopes, taping them closed, writing three and four checks for the same amount-due, no matter how many times we try to tell him or help him...

I wish you the best of luck. Keep talking to people about it because, hard as it is to reveal these intimate things, that's the only way to hang on to your own sanity.

It all sucks. It just fucking sucks.
 i know this problem.  What i did was stop mentioning anything about any doctors or appointments.  When appointment day comes i told her we're running errands and going out for lunch to get her in the car. 

  Its a little awkward when you roll up to the doctors office instead of the mall but that goes away once inside.  good luck
Take her out to brunch, then shopping, then hey let's nip into this office real quick I have to pick up your prescription oh look it's your dr's appointment.

edit: u/Lunch_Sack you beat me to it haha.
I'm so sorry; you sound frayed. Prayers being sent. As she has other health issues, would it be possible to offer a therapeutic half-truth, that the doctor visit is a general check-up, or focused on another health area she acknowledges?
Since lots of people gave good suggestions on your Mom, I'm going to focus on you.

For yourself I recommend some funny short stories. Hyperbole and a Half by Allie Brosh is fun and simple. She shares the chaos of her life plus drawings. 
The Oatmeal is a simple comic online and he touches on lots of topics. 
But I would definitely look for some outlets for yourself. And humor can be wonderful compared to all the stress caregiving brings. 
Meditation can be helpful too. Just getting fresh air and some silence definitely helps me, if the sun is shining- even better.
Long hot shower. Maybe look for an aromatherapy shower steamer that releases a scent you enjoy. Soak your feet in some Epsom salt, rub them with lotion and put socks on. 
Give yourself permission to slow down and do some things for you.

Some places offer in-person caregiver support and can watch your loved one while you attend. You might see if that is an option locally.

You're doing all you can, and that's enough. Be kind to yourself in a period of great upheaval.
First, take a breath. You need to try to take care of yourself. Take a walk if needed. Do something for yourself and only yourself even if it’s 10 minutes a day.  It’s all a lot to take on. I understand you are frustrated. I am wishing you well. 

Maybe it’s possible to call the doctor’s office and explain that your mother is saying she won’t come in— maybe ask if they offer virtual appointments. Many offices started this during covid. If she has had all of her testing done, it might be an option? It can’t hurt to ask. 

If you are overwhelmed, try reaching out to a support group or your local senior center. They may have resources you aren’t aware of. 

Wishing you strength!
I know each person is unique but for my mom, who rejects doing anything at all, we just discuss it in terms that are less about choice and more about when it will happen. Then day of, we just power through each step - car ride, wheel chair to office, office visit - trying to give as much support in the moment. It’s sad but every step is traumatic. 

Is your mom mobile? One thing that took me off guard is that I tried to load her into our SUV and simply couldn’t! The seat was a few inches higher than her waist and she simply couldn’t lift herself, and the attempt of us lifting her freaked her out. We were lucky that we could borrow a sedan where the seat was lower than waist height, so she was able to drop into it kind of like she does in her recliner. Now we have step stools for loading but haven’t tried the SUV again yet.

Good luck!
I feel you! I have also moved in with my dementia suffering and still super stubborn mom. If at all possible we do video visits with her doctor and specialists, I am not sure if that's an option for you, but if so, utilize it. I also try to schedule appts at times of the day that are consistently better for her, she is not a morning person so we do them in the early afternoon. I am glad you are able to continue with your mental health professionals, mine have proved invaluable in keeping me sane through all of this. I am sending you lots of positive thoughts and I hope you find a solution that works for you and your mom. :)
I don't have any helpful advice but I will pray that you get some and she does go to the appointment.
I’m pulling for you! 

A lot of the suggestions here seem more helpful for someone who is further along.  Depending on where you mom is at. Try to have one conversation about how important this is and that you only want the best for her. You’ll know the best way to approach or not approach this. 

Early in the diagnosis stage my dad made excuses (his sleeve was in the way and covering part of the test…) and I explained to him that these were tests he would have breezed through not that long ago. I was gentle but clear that he was declining. 
I try to find a way to explain things where going isn’t hard and the consequence of not going will be worse vs a quick appointment. 

After that don’t keep bringing it up. Just move forward as if it’s an immovable requirement to go to this appointment.  


If she’s not ti the point she can’t be left alone try to schedule some time for yourself. Schedule it. Don’t cancel. And make sure its something you can look forward to.

(Edit: I’m absolutely not qualified to give advice. I wanted to comment and give you some ideas based on what has worked for me. I know the feeling where you’re at your wits end. I also wanted to comment to let you know you’re not in it alone. :) )
Thank you everyone! Time and again this sub saves me. I appreciate all of your suggestions, support, and prayers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. My mother also suffers from NPD and I am an abuse survivor, which makes things more difficult (just offering addtl context). Normally I would not have reminded her of her neuro appt so far in advance, and I would have tried to distract her the day of the appt, but she’s currently in PT and scheduled a session for herself that conflicts w the neuro appt. I temporarily forgot that reasoning doesn’t work w her when I reminded her that her neuro appt is next week and we can’t miss it, and that we’d need to reschedule her PT appt. That’s when all hell broke loose. I’m typically a bit more strategic/delicate in handling doc appts w my mom but, as indicated in my post, I’m not my currently high-functioning self, and I kind of biffed the whole “hey we have this appt next week and we need to go to it” portion of things. It’s several hours since my post, I’ve reached out to a few friends and had a chance to collect myself a bit. Your comments and care have helped me tremendously; hugs to all of you. I know this journey we’re all on together yet alone is fucking fraught. ❤️

Dementia,Tracking systems?,"Hi there! 

New to this community, and in a bit of a hurry here- sorry if I miss any rules! 
I am looking for recommendation on Tracking systems for my grandfather. He’s started wondering, and it’s very worrisome. 
Does anyone have any that they recommend? 

Thank you in advanced!","Does he has a phone that he takes everywhere with him you can always use one of those apps that helps you locate your family members I forget what they're called. I think it's mostly used for kids but it would work for old people to I'm sure. Another thing I've heard about is some kind of device that fits inside the loved ones shoe like inside they're heel of the shoe Maybe. That would be good unless they're person that wanders around at night with no shoes on which also happens. I'm sorry I use voice to text and so sometimes it doesn't understand me at times crazy things LOL
An apple watch would probably be the best, if he actually wears it lol. It is good for the fall detection too. Tile can work but they are too big unless you can sew it into his jacket etc. Air Tags are more subtle, it might fit into his shoe or similar.
Here’s what I found when I looked into this.

Most active trackers have the problem that they need charging.  You first need to decide if your grandfather would remember to charge or wear the tracker.


Second, if not then look at something like tile tags or air tags.  AirTags are the model I’m most familiar with of these types.  It’s a passive tracker that uses nearby apple devices (anyone’s, but just yours) to do the active tracking. So their battery lasts around a year.  It’s also very easy to remove the speaker since it’ll try beeping when too far from your iPhone as an anti-stalker system.

At this point, it comes down to hiding it in something your grandfather will take with him when wandering.  Shoes, wallet, etc.

There are flaws with AirTags for this.  They need to be pinged by an iPhone.  If he books it into a forest you would maybe get a ping from the parking lot or near the road, but not how far in he went.  Until your phones gets close enough to him.

It also doesn’t update in real time.  Sometimes up to 20 minutes.  Normally it’s faster than that when I’ve legit misplaced something, but I noticed when I and my friends were messing around the time went up.  Possibly more anti-stalking as the arrow pointing in the tags’ direction also doesn’t work if you are close but the tag is moving.",2022-04-21 16:44:18,CeruleanK,u8x4lg
Dementia,Grandma living with us wants to move out.,"So my grandma is 76, and due to a traumatic brain injury in the 80s she has dementia. 
She moved in with my parents four years ago due to she cannot drive or cook, and she chose to because she understood how difficult it was living on her own. Well this year due to my(25 f) high risk pregnancy I had to stop working so my husband and I had to move in w/ then as well as my 1 yr old. We rent out our house to help with mortgage and to help financially.

Well my grandma is getting worse and verbally abusive to me, that I never take her out, that I just sit around and don’t help and when I don’t put a jacket on my son (to go outside in 68 degree weather to the car) that I’m a horrible mother. But when I cry(as an 8 month pregnant woman does hearing that) she tells me I’m nothing but a cruel person and hate her. She says it is so bad that she is moving out (to a senior place.) 
She still Can’t cook, she is legally blind and she doesn’t recall if you tell her what day it is or gets extremely nasty.
She has a follow up in May to see if it’s even possible but if it’s not idk what to do. I don’t want my sons hearing me get degraded legitimately 8 hrs a day, but at end of day I don’t want her moving out either. I’m just at a lost because I can’t comprehend how my best friend now hates me and calls me horrendous names. I can’t talk/vent to my mom because it hurts her feelings. My husband just says “it’s not her” which I know but it still hurts. Idk what else to do. It feels like no one even wants me here. That I’ve ruined everything. But where can I go to talk about it?","Help pack her bags.
Unfortunately some of us get the ""Mean B*tch"". I'm not sure if anyone with dementia actually stays sweet? 

I went through the same thing. It was not constant insults but a lot of yelling and being told ""Get out!"" 

Idk if she's on meds for her mood but my grandma got put on Citalopram. It has helped tons. She is way more stable. I only deal with an occasional outburst now. 

I think as dementia progresses, small kids seem to be a trigger for anger. The noise and over stimulating behavior just sets them off. I've witnessed it when we have small kids over. 1 kid for a few hours brings her smiles. Small kid for lots of hours makes her angry.

I'm sorry you're losing your Grandma like this. Because it does hurt. And it's okay to cry because of her. This was how I started mourning her while actively caring for her in my case.
I’m sorry she’s being so mean. ETA: Seroquel can help a lot 

If you’re a glass half full kinda person, oftentimes it is very difficult convincing the patient from their home to assisted living or nursing home. In a way she’s giving you a blessing by getting one foot out the door. I hope these websites can give helpful information on moving her to a nursing home that is suitable. Or at least to get in-home help to manage her in the meantime

This is common in elderly who may have urinary tract infections.  She needs to be tested & treated - it could be deadly.
My grandmother had this as a symptom of her dementia. She even made a police report about a man who would stand in her yard and stare at her (to their credit the police were actually really nice about it). See a doctor asap.
Yeah with hallucinations whether auditory or visual requires a doctors visit.
Came to echo the others.  My grandmother has the children hallucinations out of the blue sometimes. She goes into problem solving mode thinking we need to make them dinner. It can be over in a minute when she pretends she meant the dogs or continue until she asks me if she's crazy.  It's difficult. 

Also, the person with POA is a male who won't listen to a word I say about general supplements, suggestions , or women's health. Catching the UTIS can be an issue. There is a smell , urgency , and increased accidents that make it obvious but it should be good medicine to test any person in that state frequently . They can't communicate it themself. It doesn't always work that way though and you have to watch for the other signs .

Dementia,What to do when there's nothing that you can do?,"My grandfather's onset was very sudden and very severe. He never set up a POA, and now he's completely incapacitated and in the hospital.

I'm not financially capable of getting a lawyer to help me file for guardianship. I'm also low-support-needs autistic, and the process of actually being his guardian is too much for me to handle, honestly. 

His two daughters both work multiple jobs and don't have the time or ability to be responsible for him, as they're barely getting by themselves.

If none of us can do it the state will eventually become his guardian. We're scared that they will cut us out of his life entirely if that happens. We certainly won't have a say in getting him the best care or getting him out of bad care. 

Not being able to handle this feels like I'm abandoning him, but I really can't do it. I watched the videos and read all of the pamphlets. It's all beyond my capabilities. 

I hate this. We're all failing him. I'm failing him. He's always been there for us. He would have done anything for us and we can't even help him the one time he needs us. How does anyone cope with this?","[deleted]

Dementia,Helping my mom transition to a care facility,"Moving my mom from the hospital to a care facility today.  I know she is going to hate it but it’s the best thing for her. Any tips from anyone about how to make the transition smoother, or things to bring from home that will help her feel more comfortable? 

What do I say when she asks why she can’t just go home? 

Thank you for any advice","When we moved my MIL to a care facility, we told her the doctors want here there so she can get the extra care she needs right now. If she asked to go home we explained she can go home when the doctors say she's ready (which will never happen). She was happy with that. 

The transition itself was rough and confusing for her, but she adapted after a week or so. 

Sending you best wishes for a smooth transition.
When I moved my dad I just explained that it was so he could get the care he needs. When he asks why he is there, I explain he is having a few issues remembering things for his safety and care. The people there would make sure he was safe and well cared for. When he asks how long he will be there, I just explain it is until he got better. 

As for the room, I brought some old pictures of his family and career. I put together a scrapbook for him to flip through occasionally. He also has his favorite chair. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope it goes well.
I'm currently planning to transition my mom into memory care in the next 6 weeks or so. The facility is helping us prepare a 'cover story' for why Mom needs to be there. Likely we will tell her that she is having some abnormal heart readings (she has a loop recorder and a history of arrhythmia) and her doctor wants her to be under 24/7 nursing observation 'for a few weeks'. 

Apparently, this method works well to placate patients who ask why they're being moved to new surroundings and why they can't go home. It's all about keeping them calm until they can adjust to their 'temporary' new surroundings...the hope is that they will eventually stop asking to leave. That's the advice we're getting from all the doctors and counselors right now, anyway. 

Good luck. I hope the transition goes as smoothly as it possibly can.
I have worked with families admitting their parent into a care facility (more so the admin/leg work of the admission process). I don’t know how to best explain to them why they live there now, but what I have seen that helps smoothen the transition and makes the living experience a bit more enjoyable: supportive family should visit/call often; bring items from her last place to make her new space feel more homey (blankets, photo albums, etc); purchase an iPad so she can entertain herself with shows/games and also FaceTime family; sign her up for uninsured services that may be provided through the home (hair care, foot are, etc); have her participate in any excursions the home may plan for residents; bring her homemade meals and goodies that she usually enjoys; encourage her to participate in stimulation activities provided by the home (art, puzzles, etc); ALWAYS reassure her that she is loved and looked out for…. I hope this helps!",2022-04-21 10:44:38,Goldengreek12,u8p8kh
Dementia,I lost my Grandma 2 nights ago :(,"I just posted about her few days ago asking questions , and now she is gone. I have taken care of her the last 228 days . I read over and over that people had relief when there loved one passed away and that they are no longer suffering. Ugh I don't feel that. I just want her back. I want more time. I thought I had more time. Dementia is such a cruel thing.

Thank you to all of you and this forum. It has really helped me a lot learning and being better for her. 

I hope you all find peace in this part of your journeys.","I am so sorry for your loss.  I am not at that point yet with my husband but I think I would feel both relief and regret.    You gave her the greatest gift, taking care of her and loving her on her final journey.  Hope you find peace in loving and happy memories.
Everyone grieves differently and some of us have been grieving for a long time as we have been on this journey. Personally it has been almost 10 years for me since her first diagnosis. 

There never seems to be enough time. 

She knew you loved her and cared for up to the end. That is a precious gift you gave her. Always remember that part.
I'm sorry.  I don't think it's ever what we expect and peace comes slower for those that are grieving.  But not for Grandma, she's free now.  Be kind to yourself, take a much needed break.  If it's spring where you are plant something for her so you can watch it grow.
I’m so, so sorry.
I'm in a similar situation, my grandmother is starting to go. She doesn't have dementia I'm pretty sure, but she nearing the end of her life. Hope you are able to cope with this, make sure to talk to friends and family. Reflecting upon your thoughts and feelings is also helpful and important.
Sorry for your loss. You did an amazing thing by taking care of your grandmother for all this time, and it's ok to not feel relief right away we're all different when it comes to that. 

Honestly, I'm one of those persons who's looking forward to the relief, but who knows how I'll react when the time comes.  I' know I'm going to miss her how long that will last until the ""relief"" shows up I won't know until I go through it. 

take care.",2022-04-21 08:14:46,BarefootGOON,u8m8l3
Dementia,How to talk to mother to stay in retirement community?,"My mom has dementia - Alzheimer's according to the neurologist.  She had lived with my father, until about a year before he passed away, and he needed to go to a skilled nursing facility.  

Since then, she's gradually gotten worse;  somewhere in 2020 about the time Dad died, we realized she wasn't thinking straight, and have wanted to move her into a retirement community of some kind ever since.  But she was resistant, and wanted to live at home alone.  So we indulged her, until she started having a lot of trouble taking her medications and dealing with pretty much anything other than immediate daily living- no sort of hired help could do right for more than a few months- the yard guys always ran afoul of her, and so did housekeepers.    

Eventually she started complaining about being lonely and not having anything to do, as well as having increased issues with stuff because she couldn't maintain her medication schedule herself. 

So we talked her into moving into a retirement community where she can live, people will give her her meds on time, keep an eye on her, and generally remove all the hard-to-do stuff from her. 

She's been there since January.  Most of the time she's ok and things are good- she's made friends, she does stuff, etc...  But every now and again, she goes on the warpath and decides that she doesn't like it there, wants to move back home, everyone's stealing from her, all her neighbors at home were so close and wonderful (she rarely saw them at all), and so on.  

  
How do I talk to her when she's like this?  I know that I can't argue with her- it won't work, but she's dogged and determined, and I have a hard time changing the subject.  And of course, she doesn't remember any of the bad stuff at the old place, or good stuff at the new place.    So far, I just try to affirm her emotions, not argue with her as little as I can manage, and try to redirect her onto other subjects.  

&#x200B;

Any other advice/suggestions?","This is probably the most common issue of dementia.  Even people who are living in the same house they've lived in since birth will express that they want to go home.  All you can do is redirect or offer therapeutic lies.
Oh good luck, good luck! I share a similar story, just slightly different timelines and type of symptoms. My mother has been in her retirement community (aka: “this facility you put me in”) for almost a year and a half. She STILL isn’t pleased being there but has made friends and since we sold the house it just is what it is now. 

I think the mental stimulation she is getting from being around people has helped her a lot. But when she gets very negative and redirecting fails I resort to apologizing. “Yes, yes. I am sorry. I am sorry you feel like that. Yes, we’re definitely can work on that. I’m sorry, yes, I still think this is the best place for you now. You’re being here really helps me, thank you for doing this for me…” Blah blah blah. What else can I do? There is no reasoning….
My mother, who had Alzheimers hated driving her entire life and quit do so in her early 50s.  In full dementia,in her 70s, she often complained that my dad was hiding the car keys so she couldn't drive anywhere.  At that point, she couldn't have found her way home from the post office, a mile away, in a small town she lived in for most of her life.  My advice, tolerate and humor her as much as you can - sooner or later she will be on to some other issue.  It's just part of the disease.
I just agree with my MIL, in retirement living for 1.5 years, similar to your story. I say “I know you don’t want to be there, we are on a list for a home that will give you more care but we’re waiting for a bed” (which is true), but I also dose it with reality “no matter where you live you will always have to go to the dining room for supper/bathe/make decisions about your day/etc/whatever she complains about in that moment”.  Then, I’ll change the subject. I kind of treat her like my toddler: okay the feeling, hold the boundary, change the topic. 
My MIL doesn’t go on a warpath (thank god) but she does complain everyday about being there, being alive, having to do very basic things like eat/get out of bed/turn on TV. It’s hard on our hearts to see. Just solidarity.
I work in long term care with people with severe dementia. This sounds bad but ""talking her into it"" probably isn't the way to go. She is going to need help no matter what, and as the diesease progresses it'll be harder for her to care for herself. This is something you both need. 

Sometimes with my residents they never believe its a home, or not at first. A lot of people think we are running a hotel and have their rooms. Sometimes in the winter I'll say ""it's really snowy out, we have a room here for you today"". Dementia is a progressive diesease, one thing about dementia care isn't to really fight it but to go along with it. We lie a lot in dementia care and then redirect people with food, TV, activities, etc. to get their mind off the topic. 

Sorry if this doesn't help btw
Quetiapine (Brand name: Seroquel)

Helped my Mom immensely with the night downing rage and hasn’t affected her cognition. She’s still mad she isn’t allowed to drive but is no longer throwing things and raging about it. May be worth asking a doctor.
For what it's worth, she's early/mid stage dementia, not severe yet.  She can handle most of the activities of daily living- where she struggles is in things like where she put stuff (always thinks it has been stolen if she loses it), where things are, how long has elapsed since the time before, and so on.  

This behavior does seem to be somewhat periodic, in that it seems to happen every 3-4 weeks, and it seems to be triggered by some kind of negative event- she loses something and is convinced it's been stolen, her knees get to hurting, a COVID lockdown, etc...   It's almost as if everything's smooth sailing she's good, but come some sort of adversity, and she wants to bail and is upset that we put her there, etc...

One hard thing is that she's got an old friend who's got Parkinson's and is ancient, and she's got a live-in helper who is great.  Apparently this helper has a sister or daughter who Mom says is willing to come live with her at her house, and thereby remove the need for her to be in a facility.  I don't doubt that this person exists and may be willing, but I doubt they're credentialed or bonded in any way, and my Mom's history with hired people is not great;  she has this attitude that if she's paying them, they have to do what she says, even if it's not part of the job.  And if they charge more, she gets upset because she doesn't get that say... her yard guys trimming the trees for her is an extra charge.  Or that the home healthcare person isn't necessarily going to clean for her, or do laundry.   We've undergone enough drama to want to avoid that with her living at home anymore, especially if it's the one thing that lets her stay there.  At least in a facility (an independent living one mind you), she's not dependent on any one person who she can get mad at and fire.  

I just feel bad when she gets upset about it, and she's rational enough that I can't just dismiss it as dementia-craziness off hand.   Although her rose-colored vision of what life was like when she was living alone does tend to offset that;  she was terribly lonely and having a very hard time- that's why we convinced her to move in the first place.  And now she doesn't remember any of that, and thinks we stuck her there solely to make it more convenient for ourselves.   Which isn't entirely untrue, my brother lives 30 miles from her house, and I live 300, so keeping an eye on her, keeping her house maintained and going by to do stuff for her has been problematic to say the least.  But she also complained - in tears sometimes, about how lonely she was, etc... 

So I guess I feel a bit guilty even though I know intellectually this is the best choice, even if she's not wild about it.
Seroquel solved all my wife’s issues
Keep her there.  Eventually she’s going to get worse and need to go back.  Try to deflect, maybe play the good cop saying you’ll look into it with no follow up.

Sounds like she’s at or nearing the point where you aren’t dealing with a person who can be considered fully rational.  Even if she’s capable of thinking logically and rationally still, that logic and rational thinking is based on memories that have been Swiss cheesed.  

If you convince her its in her best interest to stay today, she may not remember that in a week, a day, in five minutes, in five minutes, in five minutes, in a day, in five minutes, etc.

If she goes back to her house, you can mitigate the things.  There are pill cases with alarms that use motors and sealed compartments to prevent over dosing.  You can get cameras to watch her.  But she’ll lose a lot of stimulation and human interaction.
How to respond can depend too on the person’s ability and motivation. My mom went through the same thing when she moved. I told her that if she could organize the entire move herself which meant packing up her entire assisted living apartment, and unpacking back into her condo without any assistance then I would support her move back to her condo.

I said to her, You will have to organize this, so what is your first step? She said, Well I know Company XYZ moved me. I said, OK what’s your next step? She was stuck for an answer, so I prompted her, You have to begin packing; to begin packing where are you going to get boxes? She couldn’t answer that question at all so she just said, I guess I better stay where I’m at.

Interestingly once her condo was sold (within about 6months after her move) she never again mentioned moving back.",2022-04-20 17:24:54,zekeweasel,u86xko
Dementia,how to get emergency shelter for a homeless person with dementia?,My father has been homeless for about a year and recently was confirmed to have dementia. The homeless shelter is kicking him out on Friday. I have been trying to get him welfare benefits but they are slow to come and there is a wait-list for everything. It's gonna be a cold day in hell before he steps foot in my house. What else can I do to get him emergency shelter?,"HELLO! Yes x 10000. I’m a nurse in a hospital and we have people drop their loved ones off in the ER bc they simply don’t have a place to go. Your father will be admitted for “placement” and will be assigned a case worker by the hospital (probably way better at their job than the county case worker) and they will find him placement. It may be tricky and he may be in the hospital for awhile depending on insurance but this is a absolutely the way to go. Either way they can provide you with multiple multiple resources
Get in touch with the Ageing and Disability program that's local to your dad and ask to speak with a social worker. I would not speak with the social worker at his current shelter as they are probably overwhelmed by their case load.
There probably isn't a place for him to go, unless there is another shelter willing to take him in your area. Some churches may contribute funds for a temporary motel room stay, but not likely for very long as that can get spendy. 

If you arent able or willing to take him in, he will likely end up back on the street until his name comes up on a waiting list for housing, but those wait lists for low income housing in the US are years long.

I would call your city or  county's dept of Aging or Senior Services to see if there is anything they can do to assist. It's a difficult situation to be in, I'm sorry.
I’m not American 

Does he have anything that would require a hospital? If so, Might take him there then tell the staff you can’t house him
What about calling Adult Protective Services?
in Canada some times when families have crisis they are sent to the hospital and live their until they get a care home. I use to volunteer as a elder health care person and two people where sent due to crisis and having dementia. I have no idea where you are or if this is possible everywhere
It’s a little difficult to answer this because you haven’t shared the extent of your father’s dementia or why he was kicked out of the shelter. Like the nurse suggested, if he is unsafe alone you might consider taking him to the emergency department for placement.
Oh boy.. I'm sure this is scary for you.  I would pursue a psych hospital for starters.  They can level his meds and perhaps assist with placement in a MC facility.
Can he not stay with you for some time?",2022-04-20 14:19:42,duckedbyaporcupine,u82vq6
Dementia,"Walks, walks, and walks","My wife was diagnosed with bvFTD 8 years ago.  While her mental abilities have declined as expected(functioning at a 2 year old level including incontinence), her physical capacity has not.  She walks/paces between 15-21 miles per day (measured), has great balance and perfect vital signs.  Has anyone else observed such a disconnect between mental and physical abilities in someone with bvFTD?","Assuming your wife is younger, this is commonly seen in younger onset dementia because while they have severe cognitive impairment their physical body is not so old and still functions the same.  Dementia doesn't typically have a physical component (although it can).  It is just presumed to because most people get dementia when they're in their 80s and are coincidentally slower mostly because of their age.

However, it would be less likely for a patient to be physically healthy 8 years into bvFTD.  That is actually a good bit beyond the life expectancy.

If she really paces 15 to 21 miles per day she may be over stimulated or anxious. Might be a good idea to talk to her neurologist about this.
Totally. My mom has bvFTD diagnosed 3/4 years ago. It’s progressed extensively, she hardly speaks much now besides singing in falsetto. She has obvious signs of physical issues like only ever using her right hand, maybe some stiff joints too. 

But she is SO strong. She stims a lot, one of those stims is punching. If you put your hand out she will punch it over and over REALLY hard.

I guess it’s like the other commentor said, they became sick so young that their bodies retain a lot of strength and vitality even as the brain deteriorates.

Edit: one more interesting thought. before the pandemic my mom also used to walk allll the time. not entirely sure why she stopped, but this seems to be a common trait in FTD.",2022-04-20 09:38:42,lapoul,u7wqn7

Having concussions is just a risk factor as many other risk factor for dementia. You don’t need to panic. Focus on risk factors that you may modify now. Physical activity, diet, cognitive activities may help. Consult your provide and alz.org website.

Dementia,Just Tell Me I Did My Best,"content warning: caregiver grief, unsettling statistics, broken hip

i (20M) work at facility on a memory care unit, and recently the stomach bug has been going around. i was walking a resident back to her room when she threw up. i am very sensitive to vomit so i turned away and called for the nurse. I turned away for three seconds. Long enough for “[nurse!] please come here!” and when i turned back she had started walking away. i watched her stumble. i watched her land on her side. and i knew. she was just far enough away i couldn’t assist in the fall, aside from making sure she didn’t knock her head. but i just got confirmation she broke her hip. i looked up the recovery rates for broken hips in people with dementia and it’s,,,, not good. i feel like i hurt her. i feel like i was careless and now she’s going to pay for it. i can’t sleep. i can’t eat. i just feel,,,, bad.","One thing I am learning as a part time care giver of someone with dementia - there is no “perfect”. You are not a robot, puke or no puke, at some point you will take your eyes off them, it’s literally baked into your anatomy.

This is why we need better investment in tech, like hip protectors/airbags, because there is no telling whether she’d have broken her hip even if you had kept your eyes on her for those 3 seconds.

You must be exhausted and miserable, and nothing we say will stop that, but just know that, from a purely logical perspective, it sounds like you did your absolute best.

EDIT: side note - I also just want to call out the fact that you are doing one of the hardest, most thankless, most compassionate jobs a person can do. The fact you feel so bad after one of your patients got hurt is just a testament to what kind of human being you are.
I know it will be hard not to feel guilty but don’t beat yourself up.  Every parent of small children has experienced a similar thing where they look away for three seconds and the child gets lost, falls, flushes bad stuff down the toilet, eats something they shouldn’t.  You are not a robot, and can’t prevent everything.  Working in assisted living is an incredibly tough job.  It was an accident pure and simple, not malice, not neglect.  You didn’t hurt her.
I would be more worried if you didn't feel bad. Never become too jaded.   I do not believe you did anything wrong.  

Something that is important to remember, people are not statistics.  We get too wrapped up sometimes in looking at them in the worst lights.  I get it, I have done it in the past as well. 

I thank you for the job you do.  I am able to look after my wife on my own for the time being, but know that at some point I will need to look for help, and I pray that whomever I need to turn to, is as caring as you appear to be.
I am a nurse as well as the daughter of a dementia patient. Please, please don’t beat yourself up! You are human and mistakes happen to everyone. Even when you do things perfectly, sometimes people have falls or wander off. Unfortunately in health care, our mistakes can cause people harm, but you learn from it and you do the best you can with what you have. The fact that you care and are thinking about this so much just shows what a good caregiver you are and the patients are lucky to have you. My dad’s care providers have dropped him during transfer (causing a hospital stay) and I have never been upset with them because accidents unfortunately just happen sometimes. I know how hard it is, but treat yourself some self care and try to move on from this incident.
Not your fault - you did your best..

with both my gramma and my mom they 'fell and broke their hip'.. but ACTUALLY, the hip broke and they fell.

imho THAT is what happens.
Thank you for caring. Thank you for reaching out and looking for affirmation that you are a good, kind, compassionate person doing your level best. You're good—you're not God.

We are all doing our very best for loved ones and those entrusted to our care. And we are all human, with both the feelings that make the job possible, and the limitations that make the job impossible. 

It's truly terrifying to realize how much power we have to keep someone safe, when they are unable to exercise the judgment to keep themselves safe. Today, it's you on the downside of the equation; tomorrow, most assuredly, it will be me.

We get through it by holding each other up, extending grace to each other. This is a space where you can ask for and receive grace. And all I ask in return is that you be willing to extend grace to me when it's my turn to ask.

Thank you for the work you do, and please be at peace.
Hey I've worked with people with dementia in one form or another for 16 years. 
You can't stop every fall. You can do what you can to minimise the risk, but people will fall. 

I say this from the bottom of my heart. You did your best. Please don't beat yourself up.
Sometimes the hip breaking first is the cause of the fall, not the other way around
You did your best. You care 🤗
accidents happen - don't beat yourself up about it.
You did the best you can,  if you puke, I puke.. it was hard when I was a paramedic, I would hand a patient a trash bag and I would grab the trash can and warn them,  you puke, I will puke...
Don't beat yourself up. A broken hip isn't necessarily a death sentence. I'm a clinical nurse supervisor and I have seen about 15-20 broken hips on my dementia residents and only one of them passed away in under a year and they had COVID. I know it's a small sample size, but still!
Stuff happens even under the best of care. The fact that you are concerned will help you be a great care provider. Now, in order to now burn out, let it go. Practice self compassion. If you need strategies, outreach someone. Your mental health will suffer if you beat yourself up.
I work in activities on our dementia floor. All day I question every action I make, I just don’t want to hurt anyone. I’m gentle, try to get singing going (they love my dances), play bowling, paint, color, horseshoes, movies, baseball on the radio, and always treat everyone with the upmost respect. But still I go home every night worried if a action I made today negatively effected someone. I love my residents but Iv learned things happen on the floor that are completely out of your control (especially residents in wheel chairs who refuse to sit down, so you try to get them to sit before they fall). Be there for them like it sounds you are. Keep it up, much love.

My uncle renovated a duplex adjacent to his.  That is where my grandmother stays when she's with him.

Her other caretaker does the same . We care for her in her home. I also have a serious pain condition and when they reduced my meds after years , I was having a hard time. Instead of running around cooking and cleaning , I ordered delivery. I did as little as I could get by with and took breaks between as much as I could. She went to sleep. The bed alarm had been moved by someone so it kept going off.  When she got up to use the restroom, I moved it but I wasn't fast enough to do it out of sight. I go finish the dishes and I hear the alarm again.  I look at the camera and she's up fidgeting with the bed immediately. I run back there and she's on the ground before I got there. I held her crying while I called for help. It was absolutely horrible . It was outside her pattern of up/down behavior once down for the night and I delayed a minute like I was told to. I don't anymore.",2022-04-20 03:19:45,thesntv,u7qt7t
Dementia,Please Help Me,"I am female(24), living with a tough situation. In my household currently is my grandma who has several medical issues, my mother who works all the time, brother who has epilepsy and me. I do not work because I have to take care of several family members at once and although it can be stressfully times I make the best of what I have. My uncle 65 has been in the hospital for the last week, he was living with us but we can’t take care of him unfortunately. 

I need advice or tips or support or anything I can get nothing is too small. My uncle has been homeless for a period of time before he moved in with us (he moved in two years ago), when he arrived we could tell something was wrong. His primary doctor said he has dementia. My uncles health is declining rapidly in a short span, I’m talking within the last month or two he has really went down hill. Everything started off with a bathroom issue and lack of hygiene. He become delusional and would “speak to his step-daughter” in his head. That progressed to wandering through the house often and eventually lead to him falling several times and he is unable to get up and down on his own. 

Since he has been in the hospital this week my family has received some of the most devastating news. Not only does he have dementia but at some point he has had a stroke or several strokes and his right brain is not functioning as it should. He has been deemed medically (I don’t know the medical term), but basically he is incompetent to take care of hisself and I know that sounds mean as ever but he really can’t take care of hisself. My grandma which is his mother can’t take care of him due to age and her own health issues. I can’t take care of him because I can’t get him up and down. My mom is never home she has to work constantly to keep us financially stable. My brother can’t really take care of him but helps when he is able. 

My uncle has a case worker and she said there is resources and help but she keeps saying he is okay to come home and my mom and grandma both express he can’t come home we can’t take care of him we just can’t handle that. We are looking into putting him into a nursing home close or near as possible to us. We live in the Northeast part of GA. Every nursing home in our surrounding area is either full or there is some reason for why he is not accepted and I don’t understand why he isn’t accepted. This is all new for me and my family and this is a lot of stress on us, especially me since I am the stay at home “care giver”. Can anyone please help us or point us into the right direction because I honest to god don’t know what to do at this point. I want him to get the help he needs and deserves more than anything. I keep calling all around my area and I just can’t seem to find anywhere with an opening. It breaks my heart because I wish I could take care of him but reality is I can’t give him the help he truly needs and I don’t know what else to do. Maybe this is just a rant or to share my experience I don’t know but I just need some help desperately.","Take a deep breath. Call your Ne a Georgia area on aging 800-474-7540 They have caseworkers for these things. You’re uncle more then likely qualifies for Medicaid. Tell his caseworker at the hospital he needs to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility that you can’t care for him at home. You might also qualify for some help with your grandma. Best of luck. You’re a good person for doing all that but you must take time for yourself.
Does he have your state's version of Medicaid? If not, he'll likely need it because Medicare doesn't cover nursing home stays for dementia in most places. You're probably going to need to call the Division of Aging services for your area. [https://aging.georgia.gov/locations](https://aging.georgia.gov/locations)  
They can better advise you on how to navigate the system and get him placed somewhere safe for him.
UPDATE: Thank you endlessly to everyone who commented! I got a call today, this morning to be exact, and we found a nursing home to place my uncle in! They will be transporting him from the hospital to the nursing home from my understanding. I feel so blessed knowing he has somewhere that seems very nice to go! He is the type of man who makes friends with anyone wherever he is at so I know being around others and the activities will definitely help! And it is about 45 minutes away, so not too bad and we are able to visit with him often. I can not express my gratitude enough to everyone who has given advice to me, thank you endlessly for everything you have done!",2022-04-20 00:46:00,exhaustedcaution,u7ojdm
Dementia,Long-lasting delusions,"My loved one has been showing signs of delusions for a few years now, but there's something I haven't found much help with. When he has these delusions, sometimes he is VERY persistent about them. You can try to distract him, but he'll bring it up after another minute or two. You can ask him questions, but trying to be logical with someone in mid-late stage dementia is futile. Me and some family will go through the usual. See if he's hungry, needs to go to the toilet, in pain, etc. When he's really bad, it's never those usual suspects. Sometimes this happens during the day, more often at night. It's sundowning to an extreme.

It can take well over an hour or two for him to forget about what delusional problem he's obsessing over in daylight. At night, even longer. Distractions don't work. Looking for causes doesn't work. What can you do besides wait it out and keep an eye on him so he doesn't hurt himself? (He's on a walker and needs help getting out of chairs)

I'm not sure if anybody has an answer because dementia affects everybody differently. But it would be comforting to know if anyone else has dealt with these impossible to deal with delusions.","Can you give an example of the types of delusions he is having?  I think that would be helpful context.
I wish I knew. My mom has persistent delusions that last weeks. For awhile, it was that her car was stolen (she's bedbound and hasn't even seen it in over a year). More recently, she keeps asking to see ""the babies"" (imaginary grandchildren; she has none). There's no reasoning with her, and despite her swiss-cheese memory, she seems to remember these for long periods of time.
Don’t have anything helpful to say, but delusions are my mother’s main issue. She has never been officially diagnosed with dementia, and doesn’t have the classic symptoms like memory loss. But the delusions are what make me believe that we’re looking at dementia, and it’s beyond mild cognitive impairment.

In our case, the episodes of acute confusion and restlessness accompanying delusions came about with a UTI but abated months after it was treated. Finding the right meds helped (Ativan exacerbated but Trazodone helped). However, the occasional, but fixational, delusions persist. Thankfully they are harmless of late, and we just play along. Given the nature of the delusions, I think of many of them as ways she copes with her anxieties. For example, I’m a gazillionaire and wildly successful at my work (I’m not, but great, she doesn’t have to worry about how much her care costs or the expenses I incur to visit her). When I see her, I do my best to listen and learn about what she’s thinking. I just want her to feel heard, appreciated, and loved.
Check for UTIs first. Then we have had good results from making a word document (or similar and texting it to each other or saving it on our phones) which puts the problem at rest. For example, for the bus:

ALL BUS SERVICE IS CANCELLED THIS WEEK Due TO ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND FLEET UPGRADES.

or for returning the mower,  a receipt for it having been picked up already. 

Or for wanting to visit people who are long gone, adding to the calendar that those people are out of town or on a trip.

It is awful to have to do this, but it really does solve some things and reassure them that everything is as it should be.",2022-04-19 23:37:38,wantwon,u7ncog
Dementia,Word salad potty mouth :(,"Oh gawd, what kind of hell is this.  Got the call today whilst driving over to visit mom that 'I NEEDED TO COME NOW, MOM WAS BEING FIESTY'. 

So 5 minutes later I'm there and she is dressed and ready to go.  Where?  Doesn't matter, I never take her out. I sit down and start chatting and it's the same word salad I've been getting the past few weeks.  Sentences start out OK then head off into la-la land half way thru.  I just pick up on what I can and move the conversation along. She's obviously agitated so I ask if she want's to go for a walk & we head out to the backyard. We take a walk around the yard, pick oleander flowers (so many I have to tell her the bush needs SOME flowers) then have a sit on the patio.  The word salad continues, 'OH, I didn't see the car by the bushes' (no car at all), etc. 

It goes on for another hour but I'll spare the insanity.  The most disconcerting thing was another resident (there for stroke, not dementia) relayed mom said she was going to kill her earlier. I asked what staff did and she said nothing. Ya know, I don't care how demented you are, I'd frog march you into your bedroom for saying that. 

They  added in Depakote sprinkles at lunch and dinner last Thursday to try and slow the night wandering. The word salad predates the depakote and I didn't see where excessive nastiness was a side effect.  What to do??? I'm going back tomorrow at noon, hopefully I can talk to day staff nurse or doctor.

OK, vent over. Gotta get chocolates in the morning for everyone for putting up with this disease.","Sorry about that. Unfortunately potty mouths are very common. Most words with an emotional component are. Swear words, sexual talk, or racist terms.

My MIL spent Easter screaming down the hallway of her memory care unit ""BASTARD FUCKS YOU CAN ALL DIE AND CROAK!"" which was lovely, as you can imagine. All because the staff had ""stolen my family and is hiding my mother (in the other room).""

She also refers to people she's agitated with as ""I'm sitting here next to... you know... the B-I-T-C-BITCH.""

I hear you with the chocolates. I'm thinking of sending the staff some cupcakes. I pay a lot of money for her memory care unit, but they could never pay me enough to take care of her 24/7.

Edit - remember to get some chocolate for yourself, too!
Yep, I’m with you.  My dad no longer can complete a sentence.  I ache for him; he tries to tell me something and he is clearly worked up, but nothing he says makes sense.  Almost every day he has some story that seems to involve being manhandled and attacked, and I hate that he has such anxious experiences (whatever they are).  Today I was warned on the way into his memory care facility that he was in a state.  I was taking him to a doctor appointment so they made him shower.  He hates to shower and he hates to be “forced” to do anything.  I doubt that they were particularly aggressive but, whatever happened, he felt outraged and violated.  I was so sorry for that, and I wished I could at least give him the relief of being able to vent. I tried, but he denied that he was upset about showering but rather that they did something else, he thought he was “going down”.  Lots of hand motions to try to show me.  I could only click my tongue sympathetically and promise I would discuss with management.  Sadly, his world seems to have become a very scary and hostile place, made worse by not being able to communicate about it.

Edit:  he is in a very nice memory care facility.  Very nice, and he has his dog there. The abuse and attacks he is experiencing are not real, or at least not in the way he is perceiving them.  I am there almost every day and my sister on the days I am not, so I feel fairly confident that he is not being ritualistically tortured as he seems to suggest.  But, perception is reality for him, sadly.
You know that oleander is poisonous, right? Hang in there.",2022-04-19 21:08:27,gmmiller,u7kjh0
Dementia,Venting about dealing with dementia in my wife,"Hello everyone, I am new to this subreddit.

My wife was in a coma close to 25 years ago for close to 3 months due to sepsis.   She was on full life support through that time and was not expected to survive at times.  Since that time she has had a memory deficit of a kind in which she would have trouble remembering certain things, but it was sporadic. She found routines to deal with day to day tasks, but never felt comfortable going back to work, or in socializing with friends and such.

She is now in her early 70's and her memory is seeming to get worse as time moves on.  I have tried to talk to her and her doctors over the years about it, but she is not co-operative and does not wish to deal with it.  The doctors, to this point, have not found it worth dealing with, but as time goes on, I am hoping for more information to bring to a medical professional for some help.

I guess I am just looking for something to help with how to deal with it.  I have been very ill in the past, and now am fine, able to be at home and help out basically full time, so for the time being, care is not the issue.  I am just grasping at straws on how to go about getting the type of dementia diagnosed, so as to know what type it is, and what could be done, if anything.

Thanks for letting me vent, and hopefully I can find a few answers.

Edit:  Thank you to everyone that replied.  It helps to know that I am not alone in my experience.","My wife has also had dementia, serious memory issues, for years. We're also senior citizens. I've never been aware of anything that can actually help it. When it's gone, it's gone. The only thing I've been able to do is learn how to accept it and build a life of my own. It sucks, I know.
I'm so sorry you are dealing with this.  Dementia is the worst.  Having dealt with it, with a parent, all I can advise is to meet your wife where she is at the moment.
Someone recently said to me…today is the best day he (my husband) will have.  Tomorrow will be a little worse. Get accustom to that reality.

It hard.
My situation has been a close parallel to yours.  My wife spent the last five years in denial (and then not even being able to recognize the problem) and refusing to even see a doctor at all. I was advised by professionals and non-professionals alike that nothing would happen until a crisis. That happened over four weeks ago and she’s now been in a Memory Care community for two weeks. It all sucks and it’ll be another couple of days until I see her. 

Just go with the flow in whatever way you can. But be sure to take care of yourself. The statistics on caregivers getting sick and worse is really startling.",2022-04-19 20:58:02,TormandGB,u7kbwa
Dementia,Early onset dementia,A few years ago I was diagnosed with Memory Impairment and Amnesia.  I know it's early onset dementia.  I also have APS Lupus and Lupus Encephalitis.  My father got it when he was in his late 50's and I'm 61 now.  I had a brain injury from a seizure from taking a drug in 2012 and haven't been the same since.  I haven't been able to work since 2012 and have been on SSDI.  I've lost my appetite and also have incontinence problems now.  Anyone else have early onset dementia?,"My mother has early onset dementia, diagnosed in her early 60s. A book that has really helped her and our family is Somebody I Used to Know by Wendy Mitchell, who is going through the same thing.
Exercise your brain, use it, strengthen it, and get a religion. Think a lot, do stuff, exercise your motor skills, and be as healthy as possible. It cannot be stoped, but it can be slowed.
Do everything to exercise your brain
Thanks for your replies.   I also have incontinence problems too now and I'm so depressed.  There's so much I want to do, but I can't do it now.
Don't take it as the end. It'll be the end eventually but you should spend that time as best as possible, working with physicians to work out anything limiting you from doing what you want to do. Also get into puzzles and other mind exercises. It's entirely possible to slow it.

I dont personally have dementia but I'm studying to eventually work on medications for some specific diseases, some of which are dementia. So far, keeping a healthy mind and physique seem to be imperative to one's quality of life with dementia and can significantly slow down the progression of dementia, it never stops though.

When you get a serious diagnosis it just feels like your life stops. It's incredibly difficult; when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, I just broke down. It just felt like my life was over. Schizophrenia, especially in my case, can be a progressive disorder in which certain mental faculties will also degrade over time (including memory, it's not as permanent as dementia and memories aren't usually erased but it can be harder to recall them), knowing this prognosis and noticing it happening just really fucked with me, it felt like it wouldn't be long until I wasn't myself anymore. I decided that I wasn't going to let it slow me down, I began working my brain keeping it sharp, I began seeking support and spending more time with those that I love, I began doing things that I've wanted to do but never was able to do. I know that it very well could be my schizophrenia that kills me, but I'm not going down without a fight. I've felt reminders in this post of how I was when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and that's why I've given you that advice because I've been in a similar spot and I wish you all my luck and all the happiness you can get.

Dementia,Is Dementia Genetic Or Environmental?,"Genuine question. When my parents were into their 60's, they both developed diabetes type 2, which is very much a life-style acquired condition. So I spent the past 20 years watching my diet and getting in exercise. Now my mother has had a dementia diagnosis and from what I have learned from my mother, my father is also showing clear signs. Is dementia related to diet/exercise? Is there a correlation with diabetes? Is this something inevitable that I need to plan for with both parents succumbing? What (if anything) can we do to give our children the best chances of not having to worry about our generation's dementia problems?","I think it depends on the kind. My grandma has vascular dementia due to plaque build up that caused mini strokes in her brain. 
https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vascular-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378793#:~:text=This%20condition%20occurs%20when%20deposits,blood%20that%20nourishes%20your%20brain.

She ticked a lot of boxes on the Risk factors listed. Over weight, high cholesterol, etc. I do think diet and exercise can definitely help in at least certain types like vascular.
Yes. No. Maybe. And if you can find a definitive answer, congrats, you've won the Nobel Prize. No snark intended—gesturing at the enormity of the problem.

Maybe the best answer is, it can't hurt to walk a relatively straight and narrow path, and have ""good"" genes, but there are at this time no guarantees. 

Here's a useful overview starting point:

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013

And a prayer for you and your family.
Definitely genetic in my family. The women.  You can do things or eat things that play a role.
Many diseases are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Mutations in certain genes may put you at higher risk for developing certain forms of dementia, but this doesn't guarantee you will end up with dementia. There are certain healthy habits that may reduce your risk of developing dementia, like proper diet and exercise, but you may very well still develop dementia. Following an overall healthy lifestyle will often improve quality of life overall, so I figure, there's no harm in trying to keep with that.

My grandmother began experiencing memory loss in her mid-80s and that progressed to severe dementia into her 90s. My mother would ask me if this was what was going to happen to her as well (I have a background in biological research, just not neurobiology, specifically). But, this is how I look at it: often, you have to reach an advanced age before significant memory loss and dementia sets in (not including familial forms of dementia that are early-onset--think around age 50). So, there's really not a reliable way to know (again, except for familial, but this would be early-onset). 

There are, of course, scientific theories about the causes of dementia, but I won't bore you with the details. One that keeps coming up has to do with overall metabolism and the function of mitochondria in your cells. This circles back to the healthy lifestyle thing to prevent metabolic dysfunction. 

You ask about what can be done, and I'll admit that after seeing things first-hand with my grandma, I probably have a very defeatist attitude about this. Dementia is so complicated. Seriously. There are likely so many types and subtypes and scientists simply don't know. People talk about amyloid plaques and tau tangles being causative of dementia, meaning that if you can just get rid of them, you can cure the dementia. Drug developers are focusing on developing therapies to clear plaques and tangles, but this doesn't necessarily result in less severe symptoms. Alternatively, some people have these plaques and tangles and never develop any kind of neurological impairment. 

What I'm trying to say is, in the meantime, while scientists try to figure this out, I think the best thing that can be done is to try and prepare as best as you can financially and to make your wishes known to your children about how you would want to be cared for (in-home nursing/aids, assisted living/memory care, etc.). These are hard conversations and frankly memory care is insanely expensive. But also, live your life with the time of clarity you have; hold your family and friends close. My grandmother, even towards the end, would tell my mother that she's (my grandma) okay, she's lived a long and good life.
There are proven links between dementia and several lifestyle/age related conditions but just because you have one doesn't guarantee you will get dementia, and then there are people like my dad - my dad has dementia due to a bad reaction to the drugs used to treat his Leukaemia.
It's both. There's a gene that can cause it, but it may not be activated and despite being a carrier, you won't get it. You may not have the gene, and develop it anyway. 

The best example of this is cancer: it's an umbrella term. It can  develop spontaneous, due to genes, or due to life style habits. Half your family getting it doesn't mean you'll get it. No one getting it doesn't mean you are safe. And then there's the wide variety: benign tumours, leukemia, malign tumours etc. It's incredibly hard to predict what will happen to you, but living a healthy life is always a good idea.
IMO, it could certainly be related. If they develop vascular issues due to diabetes, that can be a cause.
I was listening to a radio show today that stated the increase risks for dementia based on race are attributed to risk associated with medical conditions. Take care of the heart, takes care of the brain was asserted. Of course as previous posts also share there are genetic factors.
Following for myi
>The number of people ages 85 and older is projected to double within the next 20 years, while the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is expected to double as well, to 13 million.

I found [this article](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/04/17/1093113623/washington-long-term-care?utm_medium=social&utm_term=nprnews&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=npr) yesterday. It's mostly about Washington's plan to help pay families for caregiving but the above quote hit me like a ton of bricks. 

Yes, I'm certain there's a genetic component. Yes, I'm certain there's a lifestyle component. But I think we should all just accept the fact that most of us will develop dementia once we reach a certain age range. 

I don't think there's much we can do to spare our own children except for having a solid exit plan in place. There's no way I would even think of putting my daughter in the position I've been in.
Think of dementia like a pizza.  All of dementia is a single pizza, but each slice, and there are a lot of them, is different. Different causes, different rates of how long from start to finish, etc. The kicker is that you can also have combo pizza slices. Someone has Alzheimer's, then has a stroke, so they get Alzheimers-Vascular as a combo. Someone else has Parkinson's related dementia and also Alzheimer's. The common factors are that there's debilitation and it's 100% fatal, but one version might have 2 years while another has 10.
Genetics..and health. Both go hand in hand. Took a genetics test and gave my daughter one since it seems to run on my mother side. We both test negative for the variant.

Dementia,Dementia and MRI Scans?,"Came across a few research papers and graduation projects that talk about using AI Machine Learning by making it recognize subtle differences in MRI scans from Dementia affected patients and using that to Detect dementia as early as possible.

But then also came across sources saying u cannot detect dementia through MRI. and MRI is just used to rule out possibilities of other complications like a tumor.

SO which one is true, I've no medical background and am really confused on this.","Middle of 2016 I started trying to get my wife diagnosed with dementia. She had three or four MRIs over the next three + years that came back negative. It wasn’t until she received a radiated glucose PET/CT scan (end of 2019) and was diagnosed with Lewy bodies. Last year based solely on her symptoms, her neurologist change the diagnosis to FTD.
I am not an expert at all. My impression is that MRIs if compared to earlier MRIs used as a benchmark *might* find signs of dementia, but you’d have to give MRIs to lots of healthy-appearing people first and then give them more MRIs later on

Supposedly a PET scan is more likely to find the evidence you’re looking for in an already sick person.
I think only symptoms diagnose dementia. It is unfortunate because when symptoms are present it is to late. So what to do? Always think you will get disease and work to prevent it. See alz.org how to prevent dementia. 

Note:  i am not expert.
My father in law shows 20% brain matter loss on rt side of brain when he got a mri and was diagnosed with dementia so maybe in some people with different types of dementia it will show up on a mri
I am no expert, either. I did a little study in psychology over some years, though. What I just read from 'Dr. Google' is that firstly, MRI is not the principle test for Alzheimer's. Secondly, the size of the temporal and parietal lobes on Alzheimer's patients does vary. It shrinks in comparison to its previous size. So I guess via imaging, they would be able to tell projected vs. actual size. I know with Huntington's disease, it is the size of the dark matter in the brain which is the diagnostic tool. So - a brief answer to your question would be that MRI is not the diagnostic tool used to define dementia in a patient. Symptomology is the accepted diagnostic tool. I am guessing in reality the answer is more complex and you would need to consult an experienced neurologist and gerontologist.
I'm not a doctor or an expert. I can only speak to my partner's dx experience.

She was showing sign of dementia. Got scheduled for an MRI. (No contrast dyes for protein markers of any particular type of dementia.) By happenstance, had an MRI from ~1.5 years ago for comparison. I understand that comparing the two was helpful, but not crucial.

New MRI report included reference to NeuroQuant analysis. I looked it up, and came away mostly mystified. Best layperson description I can find here: https://americanhealthimaging.com/blog/news-media-blog-what-is-neuroquant-why-it-matters/.

Key sentence: ""it calculates the volume of those brain structures and compares them with a database of what’s normal based on a person’s age, gender and cranial volume.""

The nurse practitioner explained that based on which areas showed decrease in volume, and compared with a broad range of other people's scans, it was almost assuredly Alzheimer's.",2022-04-19 13:32:40,AN0NYM0US__Gentleman,u7an45
Dementia,Father has been diagnosed with Dementia and I think it's also coming for my Mother.,"My parents currently live alone, and my siblings and I just found out that my Father has dementia. My Mother has been hiding the fact from us for unknown reasons, and my Father is pretty far along. By my estimate, he's somewhere in stage 6. The doctor has said that this is rapid onset. I just made a trip home and he can barely talk and frequently soils himself. My mother is taking care of him and I worry about the strain that it's putting on her, as she already has notes up around the house that say things like ""Feeling tired, check blood sugar."" (Both are diabetic)  


Long story short, they had an initial visit with a neurologist and now my Dad has made it known that he doesn't want to go back for the follow up visit where they would run tests to figure out what's going on. I believe that it's because he doesn't want to be put in a care facility. The thing I need to know though, is if the doctor will report him to the state. They currently reside in Louisiana and I've heard some conflicting reports that they will or won't. I want what's best for him no matter what, but I'm also concerned that my sister(closest sibling and emergency contact) or mother would get in some kind of trouble if he doesn't go back. 

Information specifically relating to Louisiana would be of the most help, but other information is welcome.","There are no laws requiring dementia patients to be put in a care facility.  The only reason I can think why a doctor would report your parents would be if they felt your father was being grossly neglected.  Your father is under no requirements here.  Simply put, if you have dementia, you're pretty much on your own.
Lol I WISH the state cared that much. You will soon discover that it’s quite the opposite.As others have said, you’re pretty much on your own when it comes to dementia. I don’t think your mom or sister would be in danger unless they had guardianship. Even then it might not matter. Get their financial affairs and power of attorney established ASAP
Louisiana's big on individual choice and not pushing government down people's throats, at least outside of New Orleans and the bigger cities. There shouldn't be any repercussions for not continuing to look further into his dementia. At long as he's being cared for, more than likely just regular visits to a general practitioner will be fine as needed, unless there are serious behavioral issues and then the GP can make referrals.

Try doing what you can to get your mom help though. Caregivers of dementia patients are at as high risk of getting it themselves and of dying from other ailments before the person they're taking care of dies if they don't decompress.",2022-04-19 12:02:53,AFGNCAAP13,u78lw5

One of my most useful breakthroughs was realizing that ""sick"" days also include mental health days. Some times self care means taking a day off and not wanting to deal with anybody or anything. 

If that isn't available, perhaps look into having someone come in for a day, dropping her off at day care, or simply minimizing the effort for a day. I know when I had young kids and needed a day off, I would just change their diapers and park them in front of a TV. (Little did I know that counted as $12,000/month of Mem Care!)

Dementia,Sensitive subject (sorry),"This is a definitely a very sensitive subject and I don't mean to bring up things that will upset anyone. 

I just had some questions about Alzheimer's and the stages and when did your loved one pass.

I have a very large family my grandmother has a lot of kids and a million grandkids. So there is definitely a lot of hands in the cookie jar. I am the who lives with my Grandma as her primary caretaker. 

According to the fast Alzheimer's scale my grandma is at 6c. She has been progressing fast since my grandfather has passed away. 

There is definitely a disagreement in my grandma time left and how it should be handled. Some people think she only has weeks to months. She has recently fallen and broke ribs and now has pneumonia. So she is definitely struggling now and I know with anyone she could pass at anytime. But I believe she will beat this and recover. 

Things I read and see saying people can live a long time in the 6 category and even awhile in 7 on scale. 

Sensitive part could you tell me on what part of stage did your loved one past and was it complications or other medical factors or dementia related. 

Thank you","No need to apologize. There is nothing pleasant about dementia, so we all start with the assumption that you are tired, out of ideas, and looking to vent or looking for help. No need to apologize for that... it's why we are here.

The most important thing to remember is that there is no timeline for dementia.

Every person's dementia journey is different.

Some people live with it for decades. Some for weeks. There is no logic or reason to why one person survives for years and another doesn't.

However, rapid decline often follows the same path... the path your grandmother is on now. A light case of dementia (like my father's) can be hugely accelerated due to stress, injury, or sickness, and your grandmother has advanced stage Alzheimers PLUS injury, PLUS illness, and PLUS stress. That's unhappy math, no matter how you look at it.

There is no reason to think she will recover from this. And if she does, her dementia will be greatly advanced. That's the reality you need to face.

But, it doesn't really change anything, does it? The only thing you can do with dementia is live moment-to-moment with your loved one, and make every moment as good as it can be for them. That's your sole job; assess where their dementia is *right now* and adapt your care for them to accommodate their current state.

Your grandmother is coming to the end of her journey. All you can do - and all you can ever do with dementia - is make them as comfortable and happy as you can, in every moment.

Big hugs... this is hard now and isn't going to get easier...
This disease doesn't run on any sort of a reliable timetable.  Your description of your grandmother's condition doesn't sound good so it seems wise to prepare yourself.  However; it is indeed possible that she will survive against all the odds.
It's impossible to tell. With my mom, she stopped eating more than a couple of bites of anything before Thanksgiving. We were told she probably had a few days at that time, the nurse I spoke with told me she was seeing signs of lividity in her legs, that she'd be gone within 24 hours. Somehow that stubborn shell of the woman who raised me made it through Christmas, literally subsisting on a few bites of food a day, was still sassy as heck, and still foot peddled herself around in her wheelchair until the day before she died on January 4th. Even the professionals who work with patients like her every day couldn't make an accurate guess on how long she had.",2022-04-19 06:22:41,BarefootGOON,u71umh
Dementia,Grandpa Copying Sleep Schedule That Leaves Him Tired and Irritated,"Hi all,

My mom and I both live with my grandpa (her dad) to help take care of him and he's diagnosed with vascular dementia. Essentially, he copies my mom's sleep routine during the week and it VERY obviously doesn't work for him. Additionally, on days when my mom doesn't have to work, if he wasn't told beforehand and still gets up early, he is angry and will stay that way all day about the fact no one told him, frequently resulting in fighting. We try to tell him beforehand when we know she doesn't have work, but we can't always do that. The ONLY reason my grandpa needs to get up during the week is for his pills, which he can get up for right before my mom leaves.

My mom gets up around 4:45-5 AM and showers around 5:30-6. My grandpa gets up around 4 AM and goes into the bathroom before her. He also goes to bed around when she does at 9 PM. Hypothetically 9PM-4AM isn't the worst sleep, but when he does this he can't fall asleep, tosses and turns, and gets up to go to the bathroom frequently, so he isn't getting much sleep. He also refuses to nap, purposefully getting up to walk around, sit in uncomfortable chairs, or doing something to wake himself up. As the week goes on he gets more anxious, angry, and out of it from the lack of sleep. On the weekends though he'll go to bed around 10 PM, wake up around 6-7 AM, only get up once for the bathroom, and nap frequently throughout the day. When my mom has breaks from work that's the same sleep schedule he does. So 9PM-4AM is obviously not working for him and is causing problems.

We've tried to tell him he doesn't need to get up with her, but he refuses to listen. He'll argue he isn't getting up with her and that's just when he gets up, that he needs to get up because he has things to do, or he'll just get angry and say that's how he's always slept, it's never been a problem before, and that he's fine on less sleep. The longer this is going on the more angry he gets if he isn't told about my mom staying home before the morning. Even on days when we do tell him, sometimes he forgets and accuses us of not telling him and is angry. Sometimes when he's upset about it he'll say things like ""oh so I could've slept in,"" which shows he doesn't like getting up this early. 

We have a few guesses as to why he gets up this early 1) he wants to use the bathroom before my mom is up so he doesn't worry about holding it or not being able to hold it, but if this was the problem than it wouldn't change on the weekend and he would still need to go to the bathroom, and he doesn't on the weekends/breaks 2) he's trying to have a schedule/routine for himself but he isn't like this with anything else and on the weekends/breaks this schedule doesn't happen 3) he thinks he needs to make sure my mom is up for work and it's his responsibility to do this.

Due to other sleeping problems he's currently taking 3 mg of melatonin, and it's helped the other issues but it hasn't helped this.

Is there something we could do to help this? Has anyone else ever experienced this?","I'm wondering if you could let his doctor know about this with emphasis on his lack of sleep. Because he is already taking a sleep aid they may adjust it to help with this. My mom did a similar thing early in her dementia. I ended up giving her an herbal type sleep aid (Midnight, got it at the grocery store) after discussing it with her doctor. Early on I would ""go to bed early"" so she would go to sleep,I got a lot of reading done lol. She eventually got in  a sleep routine separate  from mine and as her dementia has grown she hasn't had to take it anymore. I encourage you to speak or send a letter/email to his doctor though.",2022-04-18 14:59:25,oregonredhead,u6knby
Dementia,leaving home while mom has dementia (cw// suicidal thoughts and self harm),"i'm the main caretaker of my mom (my parents are separated, but my dad comes to visit everyday) who i suspect has dementia but due to financial constraints, we haven't been able to get a diagnosis yet. i'm 19 years old and graduated high school last year. i deferred my admission to university so that i could help figure out what to do with my mom.

i've experienced depression since i was 12 and have recently developed what i think is anxiety. this whole situation and all these responsibilities took a huge toll on my mental health. my mom has become slightly verbally abusive too. when i'm in a depressive episode, i think about just not existing anymore and i've started to self harm a few times. i know that this environment is very toxic to me and leaving would save my mentality. it sounds immature, but i want to be like my other friends who've started their college journeys and are learning and experiencing new things. i'm supposedly due to leave in september but i'm not sure if i'll make it there since it depends on a lot of different factors. my dad has agreed to take care of my mom if i have to leave, and we are currently working together to think of a good arrangement.

every time i think of going to uni, i get excited to finally leave and meet people (i haven't met any friends face to face since the pandemic began in 2020) and just have a life for my own. but at the same time, my heart breaks when i think of leaving my mom. 

during one of our arguments, she got the impression that i didn't like her anymore and i was going to leave her right away which sent her into a big meltdown of crying and sobbing and screaming. that scene repeats in my head over and over whenever i think of leaving, and the guilt and frustration is eating me from inside.

what should i do? any advice on coping? i don't even know what to tell her when i leave :(

tl;dr being the main caretaker for my mom is killing my spirit and i need to leave to save myself, but thinking of leaving her breaks my heart","You deserve a life. Period. Full stop. And you are a kind, caring person who doesn't want to abandon mom. Also period. Full stop.

It sounds like you are working on a plan for mom, which doesn't involve you setting yourself on fire to keep your mom warm. That's essential. You are taking on responsibilities well beyond what you're ready to cope with just now.

It might help ease your mind to understand why your mom responds as she does. A few resources:

Alzheimer's Association, alz.org. There's info on the website, and a 24/7 phone number.

*The 36-Hour Day,* a book for caregivers that covers just about everything—both what you're likely to encounter from mom, and how to interact in ways that don't set her (or you) off.

Folks on this sub also recommend YouTube videos by Teepa Snow. There's an Android app if you search for that name, although cursory information. Probably on Apple too. 

Another Redditor on r/Alzheimers recommended an article, what dementia looks like from the inside; https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/u5ljqu/-/i53e297. Or if you'd like only the article, you can download here: http://www.dementiacarestrategies.com/12_pt_Understanding_the_Dementia_Experience.pdf
I’m sorry you are going through this. When your peers are being shored up by their parents you are the pillar for your mom. It wasn’t on purpose. 

Illness strikes when it does; her brain doesn’t work right. She will say things she doesn’t mean. Lash out. It isn’t her. She has a short in the wiring. 

Can you look for a crisis hotline? There are numbers you can call - 24 hours a day - to talk to a trained mental health person. They can direct you to local resources. 

It’s particularly hard at your age to find a peer going through the same thing. I had a similar situation. That too is when anxiety, panic and depression set up shop in my mind. 

Put your own mask on before you help others they say. How can you get that sliver out of your finger when you have a log stuck in your eye? Those are just ways of saying take care of yourself first. 

Eat. Shower. Dress. Mind your mental health. Take a walk. Reach out to a religious advisor if you are so inclined. Or a beloved teacher. Relative. People want to help. You have to tell them you need it first. Call. Write. Text. Email. 

I’m sending warm regards to you and hoping you reach out for the help you deserve. You’re climbing a mountain at 19! Your friends will be in their 60s when they will be on that mountain. You will hopefully be relaxing somewhere special as that part of YOUR life will be long behind you.
Go to school.  My mom was not herself the last six years and just died.  If I hadn't done things that I wanted, it would be one downward free fall.  

You need to get out and do things, find a good job, etc find happiness.
As a mom myself, I would want my kids to live their lives…to be happy…not stuck caring for me. Your moms brain is dying so she can’t express this but I believe she would feel the same. 

Don’t be afraid to live your life. Go to school and have adventures.
You must pursue your life.  Of course you should do what you can, with the help of your father and other resources, to ensure that she is safe and cared for.  But it is not your responsibility to forego your life and it sounds like your dad understands and is willing to help.  You might feel guilty but I can assure you, no matter what you do or don’t do, you will probably feel guilty.  It goes with the territory and you can’t let it guide  sensible planning.
It's great that your dad will care for her after their divorce, that's a very nice silver lining. OP, what do you think you'll study if/when you go to college? I think you should go or do something else to further your vocational skills and knowledge, as just going to college like your friends to attend anything can be a vast waste of time and money.
💙
Leave as soon as possible because you need to feel safe.  

My daughter committed suicide last week and I recommend that you go to a doctor for help and a therapist as well.   Suicide IS NEVER THE ANSWER.   We all feel sad at times but things will get better.  I am heartbroken and can't describe what I feel.  Please don't hurt yourself and please call the suicidal hotline 800-273-8255 immediately.  
It is so important to tell someone you love and try to be around people that love you.  Do not be alone because that is exactly what happened with my daughter.    
You can write to me and I will help you.   
PLEASE DON'T DO IT.  Pray a lot and God will help you.  You have all your life ahead of you and you can be happy.  
Do not put your family through this.   
You are a good person and you need to be strong and get help.  I recommend for you to see a doctor and have them do blood work to ensure check your hormone levels or chemical imbalances that can easily be corrected.  You have to reach out immediately  because depression might get stronger with time.  You need to act now.",2022-04-18 13:49:14,sushidumplings13,u6j0tv
Dementia,What's the average age when Dementia starts to set in?,"i'm trying to cross reference this with life expectancy, to see if the high amount of elderly dementia patients in the local old folk's carehome is related or correlated to increase maximum age","Check with Alz.org. if the website doesn't make stats easily accessible, they've got a phone number to call. Focus is  on Alzheimer's (~70% of dx'd dementia is Alzheimer's), but some coverage of other dementia types. Expect some slippage in numbers; not sure how fine-grained you want to get.

Edit: to the best of my knowledge, U.S. stats is also focus.

Dementia,Are we at the end already? LBD,"My grandad (75) only got his diagnosis yesterday, but I'm afraid it may have come to late to help.

For the last week he's been at the hospital and his symptoms have gotten so much worse. The fluctuations seem to come out of nowhere and the brief moments of clarity are heartbreaking for him and us. 

 In the past couple of months (after covid and a stroke in January) there has been a cycle. He will lose his ability to walk at home and go into a delirium phase with hallucinations (usually of dead loved ones). He goes to the hospital for a few days and regains lucidity while there. He can also walk again. They send him home. He's fine for a couple of weeks and then the symptoms repeat. This is the fourth time... Only this time his mind and motor function aren't coming back.

For at least 5 days now, he won't eat more than a bite or two of food, and only that to humor us. He barely drinks anything at all and has had fluids from an IV the whole time. 

The hospital hasn't said anything about this being the end. Before he went into afib yesterday, they planned to discharge him to a rehab facility (it wouldn't have worked out, because he isn't lucid for more than a couple of hours at a time and is pretty combative  his Medicare is just pushing for release) ...but his decline in function has been so rapid over the last few months, and I keep thinking that this is it.","Virtual hugs.  https://pmabraham.medium.com/the-dying-process-at-the-end-of-life-9804fe1e3b36 might be an informative read.

The majority of staff at hospitals are not trained at end of life let alone end of life decisions. There are exceptions for palliative doctors. Have you considered hospice? 

Hospice is palliative care at end of life. It cannot be provided in a hospital unless there are uncontrolled symptoms and they plan to go home whether home is a private home or a facility.",2022-04-18 09:38:03,Suspicious_red,u6ddng
Dementia,Easter wasn’t the same,"For Easter my family cooks a big meal (me and my mom) and immediate family come over to spend some time with my grandma. This year is different, and it hurts more than I thought I would be affected. 

My Uncle who was staying with us has been diagnosed with dementia. The past week he had to go to the hospital because he over all was not doing well. We received some of the most awful news and that is bad enough. We were not able to go to the hospital to visit him today for Easter and that bothered me tremendously. I thought about his condition and how he’s in a hospital room by hisself. He didn’t get to have a grand big meal, didn’t get to sit outside on the porch, didn’t get to see everyone. I don’t know if he is or is not aware of what’s going on or if it was Easter, but that hurts my heart so badly he missed out on so many of our usual holiday activities. I hope he wasn’t scared or uncomfortable or depressed. Everyone in the family are so wrapped up in their own things which I can understand to a point. I can’t drive and mom had to work so I basically had no way to visit. He isn’t allowed to have his phone as per the hospital but he can use the hospital phone but he’s not able to hold much of a conversation. It’s easier to visit in person than over a phone. It has been so hard dealing with him to be honest but it kills me thinking what if he thinks we abandoned him. I hope he forgive me for not being able to visit today. I pray he doesn’t feel abandoned I am so sorry, but I will try my best to come ASAP. I just feel like a terrible person for not being able to visit for Easter. I feel like a monster.","Please forgive yourself.

Unfortunately, dementia is marked by continuous loss, on the part of the patient and everyone else who loves them.  You clearly care deeply about your uncle and the rest of your family.  There will be times, like this one, where you feel inadequate.  You have to keep these “failings” (I.e., being human) from eating you alive.  

One of the things I have learned in my caregiving journey is that people who have been caregivers are very empathetic.  One of my friends who cared for her mother and her aunt in their times with Alzheimer’s disease will do anything in her power to help me.  You may find among your friends someone who has already walked in your shoes.  Ask for and take their help.  You cannot hold up the sky by yourself.",2022-04-18 01:13:12,exhaustedcaution,u65dom
Dementia,Two falls in 72 hours at assisted living . My mother has never fallen at home. For safety and better care and ease to my step dad who is her care giver - moved in last week. I get it’s a new place - is this normal?,Obviously staff told to monitor her - of course now wondering if moving in was a mistake,"My MIL fell practically every day after moving into assisted living.  She knew she was unsteady on her feet, refused to use her walker and refused to call for assistance when she needed to get across the room or into the bathroom.  She was just stubborn about that one thing.  Nothing anyone could do but have the staff check on her more frequently and take her to the bathroom, really, she never stopped falling until she was bedridden.
Falling can be common for some dementia patients. My father has Parkinson's / lewy body and falling is a very common situation for us. I cannot speak for all dementia patients, but for our family protecting my father from falls is ongoing effort.
What were the circumstances of the falls?
Does she have a walker?  Are they new surfaces that she is not used to?
Grippy soft socks, and ask for grippers to be put on the floor leading into the bathroom. Those two fixes stopped my grandma from falling in her new room.

That, and adjusting her rollator/walker.
You may want to get her to a doctor for some blood work. She may be dehydrated or have some other imbalance. Sometimes new circumstance disrupt routines and she may not be drinking as much
Facilities have a lot of restrictions in regards to preventing falls. Most facilities do not allow for side rails, fall mats, medication for the sole purpose of sedation, and sometimes do not even allow specialty wheelchairs that are heavily padded such that the pt cannot easily get out.

Furthermore, most facilities are extremely short staffed and it’s very hard to Provide one to one care and monitoring.

One consideration is to ask the providers if now is the time for hospice. Hospice nurses are specialty trained in dementia and other terminal illnesses and can often help the staff with ideas and treatment options to help maintain functionality and comfort through the end of life.
Hope the falls didn’t result in injury. New space may take time for her to get acquainted. I am a fan of 1on1 support for at least the 1st 48 hours is available (and can be afforded). I am also a fan of occupational therapy support in these instances to review her layout and fall risks (get an OT in ASAP). Hydration, sleep, medications all may play additional parts in the falls
Before she completely lost her balance and had to be in a wheelchair 24/7, our LO had several falls, one of which sent her to hospital with stitches and a brain bleed.  She’s had a few falls since moving to the wheelchair, when she gets out of bed in the night or tries to get out of the chair when there’s no one around to stop her. We tried a walker but since she had never used one she didn’t understand that it was hers or how to use it safely.  She doesn’t know or understand that she can’t stand or walk independently so that’s why she falls when she gets up, she doesn’t know to ask for help. 

In the weeks before she went into LTC her balance was very off. We’d go for a walk and she’d be clutching my arm so hard for balance that it hurt, and it was a physical struggle to keep her walking straight.  Not sure if it was an issue caused by the disease, medication, eyesight or something else, but it has been ongoing for her. 

The nursing home got her padded shorts to wear under her pants, and we got her a padded hat to wear, all for protection.  Falls are scary, and we’ve been lucky with her injuries being mild for the most part.",2022-04-17 22:50:10,kathc2021,u62xxu
Dementia,This easter is ruined,"Tw Cw for animal death +srry for mobile+srrt if confusing thisjuat happen and upset 

For years now it been clear my grandfather (mid 90s) has something going up there and he has at least dementia and after my fathers death and him getting covid bad it worsen. My grandma and siblings want to deny it but theres no more denial he forgot my kitten was on the floor and he stepped on her and she died and im just so upset and anger and he littertly did forget she was on the floor and he’s upset and crying because he adored her too but he just killed her because he thought everyone was taking too long so he was in a rush, he forgot she was there and then didn’t relized and she was so small and he is not a super big man but he didnt relized. 

I just feel so helpless watching this progress for years now especially with being so young and him and my grandmother were the one to raise me and the culture of machoism saying not to get aid from doctor or others and my silbings scared of loosing him too which lead to their denial and now we all saw what happened and my poor kitten suffered and they will still deny it despite me being the main one aiding in the day to day with my grandparents and just loosing my poor Chupala","This situation is so terrible. I am so so sorry this happened to you :(
I’m just so sorry for you, and of course Chalupa. Often those who deny (and probably now he can’t even realize it) hurt everyone and everything around them.
So sorry for the situation.  maybe grandfather DIDN'T SEE the kitten..

It is very sad that the kitten has died in this accident and yes your grandpa may need care.. but he may also need forgiveness and maybe try to reduce his 'fault'.

Take some of the blame off him and onto yourself...out of kindness and love of your grandpa..  ""letting a tiny kitten run around a lot of adults?""  I'm not saying it's your fault, not in the least,  but your kitten is gone and your grandpa is suffering for an accident.  better to hug and weep together.

None of us can help getting old and losing memory, agility, strength and our senses.

Be kind to grandpa.

Dementia,Anyone have experience with agitated/uncooperative dementia family member?,"Hi, new to this subreddit.  My grandmother was diagnosed with dementia about a year ago, but no actions were taken early and now it is overwhelming.  I am NOT the main caregiver for my grandmother, her husband is (he's 92).  No one has POA.  Recently she beat my grandpa up with a maglight (a heavy flashlight) because she thought he was someone else.  She throws away her clothes, because 'they aren't hers', she refuses to take any medication for the dementia because the first one she took made her VERY sick.  After the incident my cousin took her to his house where she stayed until they got her a place at a skilled nursing facility.  She was at the skilled nursing facility for maybe 4 days and then had to leave because she was trying to wander and leave the premises, she was being combative, and uncooperative.   So my family (her son, grandson, and husband) brought her to a behavioral health unit for 'medication management'.  Now she is highly medicated and can barely speak to us.  Our family Zoom called her today and I couldn't believe how bad she looked.  She was sitting up in a chair, could barely open her eyes or talk to us.  I was NOT prepared for something like that.

My questions for people who have been through something like this..  Is this a normal process?  What are your experiences with something like this?  What was the next step?  How long did this 'process' take before they were able to get the meds needed and get to a nursing home?

TDLR: I've got some questions for people who have a dementia family member who is uncooperative, combative and trying to seek a resolution outside of being a 24/7 caregiver at home.","You or grandma's Power of Attorney should ask to speak with the social worker on staff.  They will explain what is going on (my guess is that they got her on some meds that work to calm her down, now they will work to find a dose that doesn't zonk her out so much).  

When she is stabilized on meds, they will have a care plan meeting where all the professionals she's worked with will discuss what type of setting is best for her (is she safe to go home, or does she need a memory care place).   

The social worker (also called discharge planner) will set up a plan for a safe discharge.  If it's back to your home, they would set up caregivers to come in and help care for her. If it's to a memory care facility, they would find her a spot. 

Just re-read that she doesn't have a Power of Attorney.  You or cousin should talk to the social worker about how to get that set up for her and grandpa.
Agitation is pretty common, unfortunately, especially depending on the exact diagnosis. 
It sounds like she was not placed in the right kind of facility (you said skilled nursing, but I’m guessing it was assisted living, as skilled is for rehab or other patients that are expected to improve). With her level of dementia, a memory care unit sounds much more appropriate.
Medications that I have seen used for agitation are typically antipsychotics. These make a person sleepy, so they cannot act agitated, to put it simply.
Yourself or a family member should talk to a social worker at the behavioral health unit. They should be able to help with placement options by at least informing you of what level of care is needed. Getting that set up may help get her out of there, as she needs a safe place to return to. Just continue to work closely with the unit she is at now. Talk to them about her extreme sleepiness and ADVOCATE for your loved one!! She cannot advocate for herself anymore, so this is so so important!",2022-04-17 19:30:11,CheeseCreese,u5z5db
Dementia,"So sad, trying to not be mad","Just venting
I’m sad, 59yo husband with early dementia, decided to warm yesterday’s leftovers over the dinner I had cooking (all afternoon) in the slow cooker while I had a bath. 
I’m not sure if he thought I was not going to make dinner or just forgetful. I’m not even mad, 
It just makes me so so sad.","I'm sorry.  (hugs)
Oh geeze, I get it.  I made plans with him to go somewhere the next day, I bought tickets and was excited for our plans.  Got up and started getting ready when he took a call from one of his friends and decided to head out and visit this friend.  He had totally forgotten we had plans, I didn't bother to tell him we had plans, I was just so deflated.  The memory loss can be so hard to take and he is at the point where he really doesn't ""see"" me anymore.  I'm sorry this is something you are experiencing.  It's just so hard.
It’s one of the most awful things for the patient and the family involved. They aren’t trying to forget you, it’s just the disease doing it’s job. It only gets worse from here. If u have anything to say, say it now. Don’t regret saying goodbye before it’s too late. Took care of my father for 6 years till he passed a couple months…it’s been the toughest 6 years of my life. It doesn’t get easier. Ur loved one doesn’t get better. They only decline. I’m so sorry for what you’re going through. You are losing your loved one and in a slow fucked up way. Nothing I say will make it better. Just hold on and make sure to remember the good times.
Really feel you, my dad had dementia and my mom was his caretaker. Towards the end he did not really know who she was. To him she was the lady that took care of him and he would tell her stories about when he was a young man and had all these lady friends.

Now my mom is getting this same way where her memory is slowly slipping. Looking at all this i think this is likely at some point my fate also.

My in-laws both had cancer and passed, this is not any better. For them they were both mentally good but that cancer just got them.

All I can do for you'll is to pray for you. From everything that I have read is to stay active both physically and mentally. Plus also eat a well balanced diet.

Dementia,Won't sleep,"Dad is 72. Was diagnosed 3 years ago but on set was probably a few years before that. 

My sister and I are his primary careers. He lives with her and I'm there every second day. We generally cope well. 

Recently he's started sleeping approx 2-4 hours a night. He'll go to bed exhausted and then instantly he's wide awake. He'll get out of bed every 5 mins- 1hr and yell until someone comes down to settle him. 

This has been going on now every night for 2 weeks. We can cope pretty well with everything else but this is unsustainable. How is not tied. We're both exhausted and he's fit and perky in the mornings. 


Any suggestions would be helpful. 

Australia","If its possible to consult with his Dr about a sleep aid or supplement like melatonin or I've heard trazadone is used for dementia patients who can't sleep. This is very difficult for you and your sister and I wish y'all best of luck. I also know for some people with dementia having to give them pills is an uphill battle so I don't know if its within reason for you or your sister to get him outside for walks or an activity that may help with restlessness. Sometimes daylight exposure helps. I live in the states but I hope this helps some❤
Quetiapine (Seroquel) helps settle them down and go to sleep. I would mention it to your Dr. You can also try melatonin. We tried CBD chocolate on my mom with some success (legal in Canada).
We had to use Ambien when my father was alive.  But we were allowed on so many prescriptions. Definitely see a specialist about his sleeping.  When you're sleeping and a dementia patient is awake.  Unpleasant things can happen.",2022-04-17 16:41:47,2341leg,u5vqjx
Dementia,i (23F) think my dad (63) is manipulating my grandmothers (88) will while she is alive,"or some context, my grandmother has dementia and i live with her and have been her live-in caretaker for nearly two years now. my dad lives 8 hours away and visits a few times a year. 

6 months ago my grandmother approached me and told me she wanted to get her will changed, to leave the house 50% in my name and 50% in my dads name, so it couldnt be sold without both of our consents. i knew that this was going to be a problem, but she started expressing these concerns to me when my dad kept trying to convince us to renovate the house and move her to his state. i understood where she was coming from so i set the wheels in motion. well we met with the lawyer, got the stuff she wanted changed. 

my dads visiting for easter and he handed me the property taxes for the house, a bill that ive been paying for two years now, and its all of a sudden under his name after 50+ years of it being under my grandmothers. it lists him as the owner of the property. at first i didnt think anything of it, but i couldnt stop thinking about it, so after a few hours of fixating on it, i asked me dad how this could have happened. the tax collectors office wouldnt make a mistake like this. and my grandmother doesnt have the faculties to do this on her own. 

as soon as i brought it up to my dad he blew up. he gave me the middle finger 3+ times. started screaming and swearing and calling me names. (very incriminating, i know). i told him that logically it doesnt make sense for this to have happened wwithout him knowing about it and without my granmother signing something. she is very easily manipulated and would sign anything my dad put in front of hers. however, he told me he has no idea how this happened and is very offended that i accused him. 

well he told me he wrote me out of his will a few months ago. (i'm his only child and he is not married or has any siblings) because of what ""i"" did with grammies will. but thats besides the point 

am i crazy to think that there is something fishing going on here and does anyone have any idea how this could have happened?","We had to have my grandmother's will fixed. She had changed it, I believe without my Mom's knowledge (her POA). Luckily we knew the lawyer who handled it and he was able to rewrite and have everything changed to the correct information. 
I'm not sure what to suggest besides talking to a lawyer. Unfortunately legal issues get really complicated with dementia/issues of aging.
I would call Adult Protective Services where your grandma lives and ask what they think.

On one hand, this could all be legitimate.  If your dad has grandma's power of attorney, then once she is declared incapable of governing her own affairs, then he could transfer her property, etc.   Some people do transfer property and assets as a way to protect them--when your grandma needs to go on Medicaid to help pay for her long term care, Medicaid looks back 5 years.  Any assets transferred more than 5 years before she appplies for Medicaid is not counted against her asset limit.

But you said she went to a lawyer 6 months ago and got her will changed, so she was capable of making her own decisions 6 months ago.    Your dad would have to go to court to get her declared incapable of making her own decisions.   I guess he could have done that?

Tell the APS call taker that your dad wants her to sell her house and move to where he is.  Him taking over house ownership might be a way of forcing her out of her house and forcing her to move.

Also tell her how he flipped out when you asked what happened.  That looks suspicious as heck.
Wow this sounds like a dicey situation..

If your grandmother does not have the mental faculties to change the deed of the house to your father's name then she does not have the faculties to change her will to include you as 50% owner of the house either.

Both of these actions are likely invalid and can be reversed if a lawyer brought this to a court.  

It seems there is a lot of family stress over changing her will and now this change to your father as owner of the property.  

What is truly relevant is who has the financial POA? If it is your father then what can actually happen is the will change may be reversed but the ownership of the house change will likely stand. It it is you then vice versa.

If there is no POA then this will be quite difficult to workout and the court system will become involved.  Hopefully things cool off so this can all be avoided.  My best advice is to try to get yourselves on the same page so your grandmother's intentions can be upheld.
Did you go to an attorney to get her will changed?  If you did then go back to tat attorney and show them the tax document and ask him/her to look into it for you.  Yes, if the house was changed into his name your grandmother would have to sign off on that usually in front of an attorney.  So, something is fishy.",2022-04-17 16:32:56,poisonivy4444,u5vk86
Dementia,Support group for patients,"I see tons of support groups for caregivers, but can't find any for patients. I think it would be good for my mom to talk to other people who also lose things, have to quit driving, get confused, have anxiety and don't know why, etc. I've seen one phone call group, but i don't think she can focus enough to get anything from a conference call. Has anyone seen a group (either video or in person) for patients? I'm in Texas.","It’s not a support group, per se, but you could see if there are any Memory Cafes in your area. They are social gatherings for folks with dementia and their caregivers.
Hmm… could you call the Alzheimer's Assn chapter in your city or area? Alz.org, the main office can help you find the more local area contact.
Any senior centers in your area, many have programs which may be beneficial.
Has your mom asked you for such a thing?
My wife asked me why there was no group for people with Alz. This happened right after I joined a group for caregivers. I spoke at length with the organizer of the group. We could not figure out how to make it work. But I still think it would be a good thing. Some vetting may be necessary. Or matching, if you prefer. If we could get a number of people together who are more or less in same stage, so that conversation could flow. It really is a good idea. I envision it working as a zoom meeting. Right now I am in a support group for caregivers long-running (about 1.5 years now - once a week). We settled at 7 people and have become good friends.",2022-04-17 15:51:36,ash753,u5uqgt
Dementia,Dementia plus difficult relationship,"I don't know if anyone else is in a similar situation. I live in a different country than my family and haven't seen them in person for a while. About 4-5 years ago, my mother was diagnosed with dementia. My dad is taking care of her. As is pretty typical of his generation, he doesn't really talk about her condition or answer questions about how he is doing. My aunt recently wrote to me to say she is in decline and isn't recognizing people. The point of her letter was to get me to come visit, which is not going to happen for various reasons.

Anyways, my mother and I have always had a strained relationship. She has a lot of narcissistic tendencies and I was definitely her least favorite child. Our video calls always consist of her scowling and making rude comments - even before the dementia set in. Discussing our relationship was never possible. Due to her narcissistic behavior, she is not capable of admitting to being anything but a perfect mother.

Knowing that the disease is advancing has brought on some strong emotions for me. I guess I feel like I am mourning the fact that there is now no possibility of getting any sort of closure with her. I didn't have much hope she would apologize or listen to my side of things, but there was a sliver of hope. With her mental state deteriorating, there is no chance of that any more.","There is definitely grief for what might have been. But the rational part of you knows it was never going to happen. There are quite a few of us with difficult relationships even prior to the diagnosis. You definitely aren’t alone in your feelings.
Let it go. My  step mother was dying and I went to the hospital every day hoping she would apologize for all of the vile things she did to me (physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse). She never said she was sorry, she died.  Later I found out she did not include me in her will!  She just couldn't resist sticking it to me one last time.  Don't bother, she's basically gone now and you should move on.  Peace.
I can relate. My mother and I had a strained relationship before, and now that she has been diagnosed I have to navigate this new phase while being unable to reconcile with the issues that were there in the past. 

Today when she’s violent, angry and starts getting enraged, I can use my same boundaries I set in place before like leaving or hanging up the phone, but now it seems counter-productive. Why would I hold a grudge on someone who doesn’t even remember what they said or did an hour prior? I don’t even know how to deal with it and It’s SO infuriating.
I could have written your post! My mom is bipolar and suffered major depression most of her life. She was not a supportive parent. It has hurt for years. Now that she is losing it and has to be cared for it is SO HARD to put away my anger and be kind. I try and remember the good times and enjoy what moments we get now, knowing it will probably only be a couple of years until she passes. I do go to therapy and highly recommend you find someone to speak to about this. Also a book called healing the child within.
There was never any chance. And now you are free from the burden of possibility.
I know what you’re going through. My whole life my mom was an emotionally abusive narcissist.  To say our relationship has been strained is putting it mildly. She started showing signs of dementia several years ago but of course refused to acknowledge it or do anything about it. Cut to early 2021 and my Dad passed away, who was her caregiver and basically only friend/companion. I ended up having to move my Mom across the country to live close to me and be her main caregiver (although she is in AL because she needs way more care than I can provide). After my fathers death she has rapidly declined. The worse her dementia gets, the nastier and more manipulative she gets. She tells anyone who will listen that I abandoned her, I never visit, I never call, I just want to take all her money, I’m a horrible person, etc. all of these things are not true- I visit weekly, talk to her daily, and couldn’t care less about any money she has. Sometimes her vitriol becomes too much and I have to take time away from her. She doesn’t remember when I visit anyways so I figure it’s more important to take care of my mental health than to let her drag me down with her. These are murky and dark waters we are trying to navigate.  Do what’s best for you.",2022-04-17 15:06:27,Zeca_77,u5ttol
Dementia,I’m bone tired & sad (TW: suicide),"Hey everyone. I just need a place to vent. So I’m a single childless woman in my 40s who moved in with my mother to care for her, which meant leaving behind my community of friends several states away. In addition to having dementia, my mom is also a narcissist. Since relocating to my mother’s, I’ve been busy managing her care while also trying to set up a life for myself: searching for jobs, trying to find social groups to join, trying to get enough exercise to support my mental & physical health. I hate being unemployed, I feel like such a loser, and it’s so draining to spend every day hunting for & applying for jobs. Anyhow. Friday was my birthday. I told myself I could have the day off from job searching and exercise and all the “to-do’s” I assign myself. I didn’t have any plans and I don’t have any friends here to celebrate with, but I at least wanted to be gentle and kind with myself. Of course my mother forgot my birthday. And I reminded her. And she went out to the drugstore and got me a Hallmark card and a bag of shitty chocolates. I know I shouldn’t have expected anything but it still made me so sad. I’ve sacrificed so much for her and I’m so lonely and have no idea what the hell I’m doing w my life other than caring for a thankless old lady and a dog. I ended up going for a hike on my birthday. It was fine. But when I pulled into the driveway of my mom’s house, I just sat in my car…contemplating what the point of it all is. Telling myself I did not want another birthday like this next year. Feeling just pretty hopeless and tired. Thought about not going on. I have a therapist who I see weekly, thank god for that. But otherwise I am completely alone, despite my efforts to meet people. There is no other family involved in my mom’s care. It’s just on me. I thought I’d reach out here because I’m sure at least some of you can relate. I’m sorry for such a long post. Thanks for reading.","Can you use mom's $ to hire some companion care to give you some hours of the day to yourself?
This is highly relatable to majority of caregivers the exhaustion,the energy draining unrelenting insanity and I'm more sorry than words can express that you are being worn down by giving up so much to caregive. I wish I could tell you things get better but they don't honestly, the disease worsens and especially when you're a sole caregiver the hopelessness grows as a loved one slowly goes. I hate to sound all doom and gloom because surprisingly there are days I'm kind of grateful and proud of taking care of my loved one and somehow surviving the worst of days dealing with this. It is Hell though OP as you already know. Thank you so much for coming here to vent your frustrations and sharing what you're going through. Sending you hugs from this internet stranger who gets it❤
Im so sorry. Happy birthday, a day late, but with the best of wishes for a better year for you. On that note, what would happen if you moved back where you were living? That is an option, you know.
I hear you. That is a rough to upend your life like that. And it is so hard to connect with new people after a certain age. Please try to stay in touch with your friends and therapist. And I know the exercise is hard to keep up with when a person is so sad/exhausted it feels like too much work just to inhale, but we both know it does help. I wish I had some fabulous advice for you but all I can say is if you slog through the bad, usually things get better with time. Or maybe ""better"" is wrong. Maybe it's that with some distance, we get a bit of perspective/clarity. I also want to say, if this situations is killing you, no one would judge you harshly if you moved back for your own sanity. Sending hugs. ❤
I’m so sorry. Happy birthday! I too have a mom who has both dementia and is a narcissist. It’s eerie how the two diseases blend. My mom seems to conveniently forget things that suit her narcissism… like my birthday.  

You are amazingly strong for what you are doing. I am not taking care of my mom and I have guilt about that.
Virtual hugs and happy birthday.  We don’t know each other but you’re one of my heroes for what you’re doing.
Happy birthday. You're not a loser; you're a kind person, a survivor, a Child of The All That Is (God, if you prefer). I know nothing I can write is enough to help, but hugs and a listening ear from an internet stranger.
Happy belated birthday 🎂 walks with my dog kept me sane last year. Now the house is extremely quiet. You are doing an amazing, thankless job. A year from now will be totally different. Don't think negative thoughts about yourself, think of all the ways you are beautiful.
I'm sorry.  I know that even with family and support caring for your parents with dementia can be soul scouring.  If there's one piece of advice I give *everyone* who finds themselves in this situation, as they tell you on the plane, you have to secure your own oxygen mask before you help the person beside you.  Finding some source of pleasure and regular human companionship is so important.  I also want you to consider that you don't have to sacrifice your life for your mother. Is there any possibility of a residential option for her?
I hurt for you and hope you can make changes that will fill your life.  There is no rule that says you have to sacrifice your life for someone who is ill.  If I were you I would start looking for an assisted living facility for her. I would tell her that you can no longer stay with her, you need to get back to your life but you want to stay long enough to get her situated in a new living facility and take care of selling her home (if she has one) and anything else that needs to be taken care of.  You are in such a bad spot right now and she's not even at the stage where you will be caring for her 24/7. Take action, don't let this overtake you, don't give up.  You don't owe her your life and with this disease she will take over your life.  Please don't let that happen to you. You deserve to have a life, happiness, joy and freedom.
I'm an only child and my mother (a self-centered woman) with dementia's been widowed since '87. We have no family nearby, or at all, really. My husband was a help when it came to visiting and helping me care for my mom, but it really became too much.

She rented, and my husband and I rented, so it's not like we could have moved in with her or vice versa. So a year before the pandemic we finally moved her into assisted living. Less than a year later, she had to be moved to a nursing home after a short stay in rehab from a bad fall/seizure.

Before the move, we were able to get her a visiting aide a few days a week for a few hours a day. It started out ok, but eventually, she needed more hours and Medicaid wasn't budging on offering more despite her doctors basically telling us she needed a nursing home. Some of the aides are also terrible, so it's important to still be involved somewhat.

Is a visiting nurse service something your mother may be entitled to? Are all her assets in the house alone, or does she have long-term care insurance? Have you talked to her about assisting living options? Have you considered visiting these places on your own to get an idea of what they offer and how they are paid?

You may want to look to see if she qualifies for Medicaid benefits. If so, services that she may be entitled to may offer to pay you for taking care of her after some training. So at least you'd be getting paid something for what you're putting up with (which is what it feels like for me most of the time). It's not ideal, but it's a way out.
Do what you have to do to protect your mental health.

My suggestion would be to find some respite care, and book a flight to where “home” is for you.  Call your friends and tell them you want to spend your “birthday” with them.  (Maybe one of them would step up and arrange everything.). Spend a weekend in the company of people who love you.  Don’t for one minute feel guilty about what you are doing.
I would never live with my mother with dementia. Ain't no way in hell. It's just not the natural way of things.
Is it your dog or hers? Does he go hiking with you? Dogs are good listeners.",2022-04-17 12:25:08,SuchMatter1884,u5qiwg
Dementia,Mom keeps getting in bed with the caregiver - anybody ever use a safety gate to stop wandering?,"She is late stage dementia, speech is a word salad most of the time.  Already on Seroquel for past year and doing OK with that. Due to increased sundowning and wandering at night  added low dose Depakote sprinkles at lunch and dinner last Thursday. I visit everyday late afternoons and she seems to be responding good to the depakote, not wiped out like the first week with Seroquel.  

The crawling in bed with the caregiver only happens on weekends.  During the week it's a husband and wife team so no room in the bed I guess?  On the weekends it's two single ladies who each have their own rooms and mom always goes in with the one closer to her room.  The caregiver isn't upset and willing to work this out.  I'm hoping mom will start sleeping thru the night with the depakote, will give it a few weeks to see how things go.

I also understand her wanting to be close to someone. I'm there everyday 1-2 hours and I sit next to her, hip to hip, and touch her a lot. We go for little walks arm in arm, I do her nails or hair, and try to engage her as much as possible.  Yesterday we played outside with the bubble machine, picked some buds off the blooming oleanders and I drew a sidewalk Easter egg for her. She does have a baby doll that she carries all day but doesn't seem to mind abandoning at night! 

It's such a tough decision to medicate more, you don't want your loved one to be a zombie, but you don't want them spending their final days anxious, afraid and confused.  Locking her in her room is also not an option but I was wondering about a child gate?  When she lived in my backyard casita (up until last year) I had an interior screen door with a slid over the door handle that I'd shut & I put a sign on it that said 'Don't go outside at night'.  So it was never locked but she'd read the sign and stay inside.  (I did have a door sensor that notified me if she did open it.) 

Anybody have any ideas on reducing the night wandering or using child/safety gates?","I wonder if giving her a body pillow would help. Maybe if she has something to snuggle up to she'd stay put.
One tip I've heard is to put a black floor mat or rug in front of places you don't want the person to go. At night it looks like a hole in the ground and natural protection instincts keep them from crossing. 

We also used an alarming floor mat to know when our dad got out of bed in the middle of the night. Might be worth it as a warning system so they can be diverted back to their own bed.
My mother did this in her late stage, as well. The facility she was in had no suggestions besides our paying for a 24 hour attendant, which we did, with no good results (they either left the room or didn't show, and it was quite expensive).
Ultimately, it made sense to have mom go into the hospice program, which meant she could be in her own home, as the nurses made daily visits for medication, changing her position, etc. She was so much more relaxed, although still confused about some things.

She passed easily within 2 weeks after starting hospice. I think she was too anxious in the facility, but she knew she was safe in her home, so she relaxed and eventually passed with family nearby.
That's why I gave CBD to my late mother in law. She wasn't a zombie and could still do stuff while she stayed with us.
per below Body Pillow - yes, and if it can be a great big stuffed animal, better. You can also put an electric pad on the floor that sends a remote alarm to the caregiver that mom is out of bed.
We used to use a child/pet gate across the hallway. My grandmother could get up to go to the bathroom or my bedroom, but couldn't go into the rest of the night while I was sleeping. I had a really tall one and would put it about chest height. Our cats could still walk under it and my grandmother wouldn't be tempted to try to step over one placed on the floor.

That seems forever ago as she's now needing help to get out of bed or to walk even with a walker. Usually she needs the wheelchair.
I had a friend who installed a screen door w a hook latch on her mother’s bedroom.  She could see and hear easily and it kept her gently contained.  My concern w baby gates is that they are low and an attempt may be made to climb over it- and attempting that can result in wrist fractures in people who fall over baby gates.
Can the caregiver just use a baby monitor to listen for her and lock her door?",2022-04-17 10:53:46,gmmiller,u5onql
Dementia,Advice about dimentia stubborness,I'm at my wits end now I don't know what to do. My grandma (who lives with my uncle) has been wanting to do less and less and doing anything to her makes her scream her head off. I watch her whenever everyone else is either out busy doing something or working so I'm with her by myself. She won't talk without crying so no one can understand what she is saying and usually when she does talk normally she usually gets her words mixed up so it's still not understandable. She also has mobility issues so she only sits in her chair all day. I've tried to keep her busy with toys and stuff but she wants nothing to do with them. Simple chores like folding laundry to keep her mind busy sets her into a screaming frenzy. What's worse is taking her to the bathroom. Its impossible for me to make sure she gets her diaper changed every few hours because a lot of times when I try to get her up out of the couch she starts screaming and pushing herself back onto the couch. She's a little overweight (probably around 160) so picking her up isn't easy either. I know it's really bad for her but there's been times where I had to have her sit in a soaked diaper for 5 hours waiting for someone to show up and help me get her to the toilet because I couldn't do it by myself. I'm the only one who can really watch her because I'm the only person who can 1.I'm patient 2. Don't have any kids 3. Don't go to school 4. Don't have a job,"Could it be something physically causing your grandma pain? UTI comes to mind. Could you get her in to see her doctor and explain the situation?
Where is your mom or dad?
It's expensive, but look into a Purewick. It will reduce the number of changes dramatically. It will keep her dry. And unlike a catheter it won't give her a uti.

For us, it improved all our lives.
Not practical when people are around but if you can get her to stand you just rip the pants down and have a pad on the chair for if she sits right back down. Then put a clean one around her feet, get her to stand again and pull it up and do a wipe.",2022-04-16 22:12:10,Jigglypuff2cute,u5d0vw
Dementia,Changing Facilities?,"My bride of 50 years has been having memory problems for a number of years. We started her on memantine (Namenda) 7 or 8 years ago, and progression had been slow-ish until recently.  We were across the country visiting our son & family for the holidays when she experienced an event of some sort that left her unusually confused, but absent any stroke signs.  She seemed to bounce back quite a bit in the next few days, and we were able to fly home.  However since then her dementia has accelerated and she began to become delusional at times.  We have consulted with a neurologist who seems to think she has Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy, which is consistent with a diagnosis her sister received at a similar age.  We got an initial prescription from her PCP for mirtazapine, an antidepressant.  When that failed to provide much help we started her on small doses of quetiapine, an antipsychotic.  This seems to help quite a bit, although there’s still a fair amount of “going home” talk.

My guess is that she’s currently somewhere in the stage 5 or 6 area.  The neurologist recommended transition to a facility.  My sense (based on very little actual information) is that the professional class seems to favor early placement rather than later.

The reality is that our only son and his family live across the country.  Up until now we’ve been able to go visit them several times each year.  Naturally they would like us to move near them.  One problem is that there is no way I could manage a move while continuing as full time caregiver.  But if the long term plan is to move, is it realistic to think I could place her in a facility here and then move her across the country in, say, a year?","It's possible she wouldn't be able to handle a cross country move in a year. Have you considered moving her out there now, and then relying on your son to handle things with her while you plan to move?

I also have to ask, will you have help moving? My husband and I are currently in the process of downsizing, and it's hard, hard work, both physically and emotionally. I hope you have someone (or multiple someones) who can lend a hand.

I'm sorry you're in this situation. This is such tough stuff.
My sister placed my mom in a facility in their town so that she and I could move mom's stuff out and sell the house with mom in a safe place with the stuff she was going to keep. It worked out for us this way.",2022-04-16 16:31:15,JollySaboteur,u56ip3
Dementia,Peed bed,"Anyone have any tips on how to get the smell out of the mattress? Grandmother peed bed and didnt know until I checked 30 minutes later. Saw wet spot went close and felt wetness kn the carpet. Anyone have tips on how to get pee smell from the mattress?

She is still in the bed and refuses to get out. My nearest help either isnt coming right now or is supposedly too busy (grandfather retired and in pasture)

Mother is on her way but 15 minutes away and need to get ready.","We have used a portal carpet cleaner - it has worked super well. 

Monitor her behaviour closely- this may be linked to a UTI which can cause psychosis in dementia patients. If you notice dramatic behaviour changes, work with your health care provider.
Yes I would try the salt and baking soda. Soap and maybe a fan directed at it. Working with dementia patients sometimes we have  to extra super tape the attends so it can't be removed easily. Definitely invest in a plastic mattress cover. Definitely a challenging time. As others have said monitor for UTI symptoms. If she just had a procedure done, bacteria could of been introduced at that time? Frequency is a UTI symptom.  Not sure what you refer to as cleaning something, perhaps a vaginal pessery, which is a device for vaginal prolapse.
This won't help you now, but possibly in the future.  I use a disposable underpad on my mom's bed.  I've tried a couple, but my favorite is one made by Walgreens ([https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-certainty-premium-underpads-ultimate-absorbency-x-large/ID=prod6272476-product](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-certainty-premium-underpads-ultimate-absorbency-x-large/ID=prod6272476-product)).   The pad is 30"" x 36"" and I place it under the bedsheet.  If there is an accident, I do have to wash the bedsheet, but the pad protects the mattress.  I also place a pad on her recliner chair.  It's pretty absorbent.

Enzyme cleaners for pets like these work
I don't know how to clean pee that's already been soaked in.  I've tried pet urine cleaners before.  If it's small,, that will work but large amounts where the urine has already crystallized won't work..

Can you just rip off the fabric part since it sounds like it's part of the bed itself?

I know there are waterproof matress protectors, blanket protectors, pillow protectors.
Salt and baking soda usually can do the trick
Do you have a cover for it?  Get one that encases the mattress and flip it until you are able to get a better fix.
I second those suggesting a mattress encasement cover. You may also want to look into getting absorbable under pads for the mattress to further protect the mattress.
Bissell spot cleaners work well for upholstery, cars, any accidents.  I would get a rubberized mattress pad as well.  If you have removable seat cushion covers, you can slide a plastic garbage bag over the cushion and then put the cover back on over the bag.  This worked on my sofas and any seating you want to protect.
This stuff is the best I've tried to remove urine odors. https://www.mypetpeed.com/

Dementia,how long can my grandma live? (last stage),"It's heart breaking, the prognosis of the disease was so fast in the last year. She is 77 now, symptoms started in 2014,it's been 8 years but in the last year she lost the ability to walk, talk and eat alone. My aunt takes care of her. I visit her every 2 weeks, and I can notice that her condition is ditoraiting at a fast rate. In the past month alone, she couldn't sit straight, we must support her with pillows on both sides, and food should be delivered crushed or liquid. She also hurts her self, her hand was badly injured (we still can't figure how). She is definitely in the last stage dementia, however I found conflicting information on the average duration of this stage.","It’s impossible to know for sure. It accelerates after an injury. Being bedridden creates more opportunity for infection via UTI and bedsores, heart strain, pneumonia. 

She should be eligible for hospice if she is not enrolled already. There’s no treatment to stop so it can’t hurt; the support and point person to contact can only help. 

My neighbor (a PT in nursing homes) said he had just seen a bedridden patient enrolled in hospice for 2 years and he was working to uncurl her limbs.

My 90 y/o grandmother had her dementia accelerate rapidly after her hip break. Three weeks before she died, we didn’t know if she would live bedridden for possibly months. The last time she left her bed (with tremendous help) was two weeks before death. She had difficulty swallowing the last 10 days. Her vitals were fine. Only the final 36 hours was she breathing poorly. The CNA said “she’s in the final 3 days” at noon on Monday and we found her early Tuesday morning.
You really never know. My mother fell last October and broke her leg. We never thought she would make it through rehab. She did and returned to her baseline of stage 6, walking and eating fairly well. I asked about Hospice and was told to wait she likely had a couple of years left. Toward the end of March she started getting more confused (like how to sit down or forgetting how to walk while walking).  Near the beginning of June she got a UTI and pneumonia treated with antibiotics at home. She was silently aspirating. She declined slowly but steadily the entire month, eating less and less and weaker. July 11 she woke up and could no longer swallow anything. Hospice declared her actively dying the next day. 21 days later she was gone. 

It really is so different for everyone. We were ready, but we weren’t. A horrible disease that just can’t totally be predicted. I’m sorry for you all.
[deleted]
I work as a hospice visiting registered nurse case manager and the stages only tell you where your loved one is currently at. Since everyone is different, from stage to stage and even at stage 7F… Can be anywhere from days to years. And the one thing to be clear about when we talk stages is the fast scale is met specifically for Alzheimer’s. We do use it for other forms of dementia but it’s not as precise.
Check to see if she has a UTI.  They are common in this stage.  My mom is in the last stage of dementia currently and she couldn't sit up straight or stand without pain for the past two weeks.

Dementia,A morning with Teepa,"Let me start off by saying that while I do not care for a family member with dementia, I do spend a lot of my week with it. I'm a caregiver with Home Instead Senior Care so I go into a lot of people's homes to give respite care to families and help dementia patients go about their day.

A few days ago I had the amazing opportunity to see Teepa Snow at a seminar as part of training for work. I have been at my job for almost 4 years and I came out of there knowing so much more than I learned in this years. She was truly brilliant and engaging and easy to follow.

I highly recommend anyone who is around dementia to look up her videos and resources.

And remember that you are doing an amazing job! It is not an easy path. When I'm done with a shift I get to walk away. Most of you don't have that luxury. You will have good days and bad days. You will have mini victories and days where you just shake your head and want to cry. You are not alone on this journey. We are here to help and support you!","Thank you for doing what you do too! While seeing my mom go through this is hard on me in many ways, my mom is in a wonderful facility that is taking good care of her right now, and that wouldn't be possible without people like you who take on that work. I know you're doing home care, but it's the same sort of thing. (Home care just isn't an option with her currently due to a brain injury that's left her in extra bad shape.) 

You're doing work I can't, for a loved one or anyone honestly, and I am so glad you're out there.
I love Teepa!!!!!
Thanks for the tip! My mom with dementia has a caregiver from Home Instead that she absoululty loves, you guys do great work. Wonderful to hear the offer continuing education for their employees.
As hard as this can be, it’s pretty heartening to know people like her (and you tbh) are out there doing good work to help people through it.
I use to work for home instead, really use to love it. Keep up the great work",2022-04-16 09:48:07,LionHawk93,u4y6pz

Dementia,does anyone know of an insurance company that helps pay for a home health care specialist to come and sit with a loved one while you're at work?,,"My experience with home healthcare through Medicare is that they only did brief visits/checks with my mom.  I had a private sitter for my mom a few days a week.

Check to see if there is an adult day care near you.  And some assisted living places have respite care.
You might check out Genworth Financial. My mom has been very happy with the guidance and assistance she’s received, and some of the clients I’ve cared for also have used Genworth. I don’t know all the details, but I understood that you can be reimbursed for a certain number of in home caregiving hours. And they were able to tell us about other resources we didn’t know about, like how my mom can receive compensation from the state because she is the primary caregiver for my dad. Good luck, I hope you find something that works out.

Check with adult social services. Sometimes there are programs that subsidize home care workers to come in. You can also call a home care agency and ask them how it works and how to get help

Dementia,Keeping key info about grandma,"So, my members of my family have been keeping things from us relating to my grandma with Dementia.So that when happens at our house we’re taken aback by it.  I really hate all this secrecy BS because it’s unhealthy to do so and now my mom is playing this BS game of keep away(she got mad for asking my cousin about the situation)This bothers me because my grandma actually attacked my mom a couple months back and we found out later that she had done the same thing to another relative. I’m just so sick of this AND this relative is dangerously in denial…I try to empathize but I can’t do it anymore",,2022-04-15 20:00:16,ThatGrangerGirl32,u4l9is
Dementia,My mom is slipping back into her addictions with dementia,"Before my mom's dementia, she was sober for 20-something years. Clean from alcohol or any substances. With this dementia diagnosis and even a bit before diagnosis but presenting symptoms, she began drinking again. 

It is so incredibly difficult to see her slip back into her alcoholism and she has a major weed addiction. I know plenty of people will say you cant be addicted to weed, but she absolutely is. She'll steal money from us family members to buy it, she'll sneak out and hide it around the house, cry, beg, etc. for it. Just now she's threatening all of us with hurting herself if we won't buy her weed and alcohol.

Her doctors say she cant have weed, she has a really bad heart and lungs, she shouldn't be having coffee either but she's stubborn as all hell and refuses to change.

I guess i just want to know if anyone is experiencing similar things? Has anyone else seen a parent with dementia fall back into their addictions?","Yes.  My late mom was a chainsmoker for decades and finally quit when she was in her 40s. 

I went to her house one day (at this point she was in her early 80s and had recently gotten the dementia diagnosis) and I found cigarettes in the toilet.  I assumed some contractor had been smoking in the house and I was PISSED!  It turned out that it was my mom. She was finding old half smoked cigarettes in public ash trays and stashing them in her purse, then smoking them at home.  Disgusting!!!!

That’s hard I’ve never thought about the intersection of dementia and addiction. This isn’t an answer to your question but would it be safe for her to use low dose edibles? Should her anxiety be treated in another way? 

My grandpa tells a story about getting his mom to stop smoking when she had dementia by acting shocked to see her with a cigarette and saying “mom you don’t smoke!”  Apparently she was like oh shoot I better not start now. I think she’d have to be pretty progressed to buy that though and you’d have to really sell it. But something creative in that vein might be better than trying to reason especially if it’s just making her upset.
> I guess i just want to know if anyone is experiencing similar things? Has anyone else seen a parent with dementia fall back into their addictions?

Yup. 

Even worse, my mother never really stopped until it played a part with putting her in a hospital 7 months ago. Then I had to move in, and she started drinking again about 2 weeks ago.  

I was pretty adamant with her about not drinking while I was her caregiver. But two weeks ago I just gave up with trying to persuade her to not drink, and walked with her to the store to get it because I had to get back to work.   

I tried.  Now time to take care of me.
It went 100% the other way with my great aunt, who'd smoked (tobacco) for at least 60 years when she developed dementia - we visited her once she'd moved into a care home and were surprised she wasn't smoking, but didn't ask her about it in case it was a touchy issue. Talked to the staff, turns out that she just accidentally quit because no one gave her cigs and she never asked for them, she forgot she was a smoker and I guess she just dealt with whatever withdrawal symptoms she had without knowing what they were. She never seemed to miss smoking at all. Just wild how dementia can work in such different ways. 

I wonder if it's much more difficult for people who quit prior to dementia, because I understand it may well leave you with a craving for it, and once your inhibitions start to wear down, that craving could well end up center stage. It takes *so* much not to cave in to addictions, and dementia takes away so many parts of your brain that allow you to do that. 

Is there any chance that you can give her something *else* and claim that it's weed or alcohol? Like, buy her gummi bears and say they're weed gummies? Because the human brain is **amazing** in its ability to respond to placebos. Generally about 25% of people in drug studies report that their symptoms get better *even on the placebo,* and that's people with more critical thinking skills than your average dementia patient. Heck, if you tell a bunch of college kids that the nonalcoholic punch is spiked with everclear, they're going to start feeling and acting drunk even though physically they can't be. So I wonder if some creative misdirection like that might work in your case. 

I mean, it's worth a try. Give her some OJ or cranberry juice and tell her it's been made with vodka. Get yourself an empty vodka bottle and fill it with water, and let her see you making her ""mixed drinks"" with it. Tell her smoking weed is too hard on her lungs but you've got gummies that will do the trick. If you're in a legal state, buy a bag of gummies, take the actual gummies out, and put non-THC gummies in. I'd say there's at least a 50/50 chance it'll work, and will make everyone feel good about it.
i don't have any experiences with this, but i can understand her perspective, a diagnosis such as dementia or other incurable neurodegenerative diseases would definitely set me into a ""don't give a shit, i want to feel good"" sort of mentality, knowing that i am slowly slipping away, that there will not be any coming back, i would also go and be as hedonistic as i could, enjoy things, even if they are bad for me, while i can.

i don't know what to say or even if i have any actual advice, just that with something like dementia, wanting enjoying yourself while you are still you is an outcome that is very understandable and predictable, even if it hurts you or people around you.
Anecdotally, I have noticed in several people and a few celebrities in the news that a seemingly-higher-than-average number of long term sober addicts and alcoholics relapsed about 2 years before the dementia became apparent. Memory loss is stressful and so it doesn’t surprise me that some relapse, sadly.
Get her some edibles?
Try getting her THC or CBD in any other format.

Dementia,Early warning sign that I missed...,"I can't seem to find the right way to search to see if this is something that is well known and it's not something I've found in reading yet, but I wanted to share one sign that I've now come to see that I missed earlier on. (That whole hindsight thing y'all, it's really a hard hitter with dementia decline, isn't it?) Is this something any of y'all have seen? 

About a year ago, my mom started telling me that she was worried about my *stepdad*, that his mind was going, and she was scared for the future because of it. This was before I'd cued in that *she* was starting down the path at all, and it didn't really strike me as much to worry about, as my stepdad is 83 to my mom's 72, so it wasn't something that sounded all that left field to think that his memory might be going. 

But I wish now that I'd talked to my stepdad in some way about that; that was an early sign that her mind was slipping that I missed. 

The main reason I wish I'd said something to him then is for **HIM**. I've spent a lot of time with him in the last month now and he's as sharp as he ever was, save repeating himself a bit. (And to that: he's also handling a LOT since my mom fell and has been in rehab that he's not used to handling, and I've been doing the same thing honestly just trying to keep everything straight in helping him - my husband has said ""Yep, you told me that already"" at least a dozen times in the last week.)

But he's still very sharp. He just hadn't realized what was happening with her; he was too close to it. 

One of the conversations I've had with him since her fall (that escalated everything) is how he actually thought he *had* been doing things wrong and he just thought he was doing dumb things that made her mad so when she would get super agitated with him he just felt bad. It broke me when he said that and he teared up trying to tell me that; for at least a year now he's been struggling thinking he was screwing things up, when really, it's been her. I feel so rotten than he's had to endure that - they've been together for almost 40 years and he loves her so much and to think that he'd been facing that alone and not knowing it wasn't his fault just hurts my soul.   


I know there's not a lot of good wallowing in what I could have done or said, but that one's gonna stick with me I think. I guess I'm partially saying this as a ""here's something you might see"" sort of thing too. Apologies if it's well known -- I'm learning a LOT right now but I haven't mastered it all yet. 

Thanks so much y'all for hearing me out, and for being here. This sub is partially responsible for my ability to hold my shit together right now; I thank all of you strangers for being kind folks silently all the time.","Yeah, 20/20 hindsight is a bitch.

Although if it's any comfort, it likely wouldn't have made a difference if you had aired your concerns to a healthcare worker. I had my suspicions when my partner started going batsh#t crazy angry at me 10 years ago. I started voicing my suspicions more loudly 2 years ago when she started slipping her clutches on cognitive tasks, ability to follow movie plots, some bizarrely dumb decisions.

I got patted on the head, told I didn't know what I was talking about, shut up and sit in the corner. Hell, I showed them peer-reviewed refereed articles from top notch medical journals. 

Dementia is bad enough, but the ""what if"" questions from being gaslighted by ""trusted medical professionals"" is the icing on the cake.

(Edit: yes, the rages are a sign. Have lost the citation, as it was a while ago. Don't think the docs ever read it.)
so what is the warning sign, the short temper and general anger?

ya, that was one sign i saw early on and didn't really attribute it to anything until i added up other symptoms of alzheimer's, and realized the anger was due to the person's own confusion and denial of declining memory and general cognitive functions, especially the executive function skills.
Hindsight, such a wonderful thing! When I think back I remember when I opened the fridge and the milk container wasn't there.  So began a search of ""where's the milk"".  Found it in a lower cupboard where my husband had put it.  Getting ready to travel overseas and went to get the passports, not there, so began the search for them which I never found, this was around 2009. When I look back there were so many little things that happened, not all at once, spread out over time which were little hints of what was to come.  He wasn't diagnosed until 2020.  He had neuro-psych testing in 2018 and it showed no issues.  Re-testing in 2020 showed a dramatic change.  So, he had been going down the dementia path for years before it was recognized.  Even if I had thought, those many years ago, that there was a problem nothing would have been done because it had not advanced to a stage which could be diagnosed. AND, when I realized something was really wrong it took me two years of doctors visits before anyone took me seriously.

Dementia,Just Jotting This Down Before I Forget,"I really don't know where else to say anything about this.  I'm not looking for sympathy.  I've had a couple doctors say that I may (no actual testing yet) have the beginnings of early onset dementia.

I'm a 54 (and a half!) year old male.  I'm not married, but I've been with the same woman for 18 years.  

I have a degree in Accounting/Computer Information Systems, but haven't worked in those areas in many years.  In 2016 I went back to school and got a degree in Culinary Arts, graduating magna cum laude, while also studying Brewing and Software Development.  I also have not worked in food service in many years.  

I started to notice a problem when I was in a biology class and a Java programming class.  I couldn't remember any of what was taught, especially when it came to tests.  It's not a problem with testing, just a complete loss of information.  I ended up dropping out of both of those classes.  There was one programming class which I completed with a 4.0, but have literally no idea what was taught anymore.  Since most of the culinary classes were hands-on, I was able to muddle through, but still had problems remembering techniques and I became less enthusiastic about it.

I notice that I have less problems when I wake up, but as the day goes on, I have problems finding my words (sundowning).  When I went to bed last night, I couldn't even think of the word 'dementia.'  I could think of 'senility' and others which I can't remember now (surprise!), but 'dementia' took at least half an hour to come to mind.

I don't hold a typical job.  I work as my partner's caregiver, as she has many medical issues.  We get by with a stipend which I get quarterly and her disability and alimony.  This means that I am technically at work 24/7 with no vacations and the worst type of boss.

It seems like my memory problems revolve around what I've taken in over the last five years or so.  A week ago I was able to tell my partner off the top of my head a bunch of stuff about an old Simpsons episode, including the title and a bunch of other stuff.  No problem there.  But something like the word mirepoix from cooking 101 (2 parts onion, 1 part carrot, 1 part celery), I just had to look up the name, and it isn't the first time.

I've had problems with depression most of my life and I am currently seeing a psychiatrist and taking meds.  I've gone to psychologists and therapists and the like for many years.  Suicidal ideation has been an issue for quite a long time, and presented itself as a solution to this current problem, as I doubt that this situation is going to get better and I don't want to become a strain in the end.  I've had an MRI on my head for headaches, which showed nothing.  Well, there was a brain in there, but no physical damage.  The headaches are just a symptom of stress, it is assumed.

I don't have any children, but I have ""adopted"" my partner's adopted 30-year-old daughter as my own step-kid.  

I'm not sure if this is a side effect of everything, but over the last couple of months, all my body wants to do is sleep.  I've been working with my shrink to tweak my medications to see if that's the problem, but it hasn't seemed to change anything.  I've been up 3 hours and could fall right back asleep if I allowed myself.

That's all I can think of for now.  I have to take the doggo for a walk because he keeps bugging me.

Y'all have y'allselves a great day!","Sorry you are dealing with this in your situation. It's rough. Do you have a psych/neurologist yet?

Any other symptoms besides the cognitive?

Keep your head up, see doctors and don't be afraid to ask people for help.
You sound like a lovely person. Don’t check out on us! Some antidepressants are related to memory I believe. Ask your doctor about that possibility. Sleepiness could be from stress or from tweaking your meds. Starting Zoloft had me thinking I’d lost my mind for the first week. So maybe try to get all that straightened out and give it time. You seem to be extremely intelligent. All your time spent learning might give you a cushion. Your brain can probably accommodate pretty well so don’t panic until you know what’s up.
You might want to have your thyroid checked.
Have you gotten a sleep study? you could possibly have sleep apnea. Briefly stop breathing while you sleep, wake up, fall asleep again, repeat. Thus feeling exhausted and scramble-brained, forgetting words and such because you’re never actually getting into a deep sleep.
I’m sorry that you’re suffering suicidal ideation. I think being more informed about what is going on will help you. TL, DR at the bottom. 

I know or know of several people your age with dementia. One has Alzheimer’s and the other has Lewy Body Dementia. The guy with Alzheimer’s had to quit working but they think he had it for as long as 25 years. Imagine if a brain issue was causing your long-term depression! Idk if that’s possible but it should be considered. 

It’s super important to see a neurologist and get tested to see what you have. My husband has Lewy Body and the Exelon patch has really slowed his decline. 

At the same time, there is a long list of medications that he cannot take. I don’t allow him to have any sedation, for example for his cataract surgeries. You shouldn’t be taking any anticholinergic meds such as Benedryl, Elavil, bentos like Xanax or Klonipin. These all inhibit formation of memories. 

To me, your brain capacity is like hearing. You can try and preserve what you have but once it’s lost, you can’t get it back. 

I question why the psychiatrist is not referring you to appropriate medical care. I wouldn’t call your aphasia sundowning. In some dementias, this lack of ability to find words is a characteristic. Sleeping a lot is also a symptom of dementia but it sounds like yours is worse that normal. 

A very standard test is the MMSE. My husband scored 13 when he first took it. His score is now 22 out of 30, so his treatment is working. He is in a decline but he is 79 and 1/2. 

A neuropsychologist exam will help determine your cognitive functioning. For example, my husband scored very low on verbal processing. That would make learning new things quite difficult. There are other tests like a DAT scan, so many tests to determine the cause. 

Finally, a good diet, exercise, and sleep will also benefit you. Stop smoking if you do - I smoke and I’m very motivated to quit as it contributes to vascular dementia. The stress of being a FT caregiver isn’t good either. In my support group, we joke that we all have dementia as well. It’s just so exhausting to be a caregiver. 

TL, DR: see a neurologist and insist that they determine if you have mild cognitive impairment and what exactly is the cause or type of dementia. Proceed with appropriate treatment.
Thanks for all the suggestions and support!

I met with my shrink today.  I'll be going in for a thyroid and blood workup test tomorrow.  When I go back in a couple weeks, we'll discuss the neurological testing.

Dementia,Suggestions for a first visit?,"My wife just entered a memory care community a week ago (see “After 5 years…) and their policy is to have no visitors for about 14 days, which I totally understand , and based on two phone calls, agree with. 

Now I’m looking for suggestions and thoughts on that first visit. Of course, there’ll be the “I want to go home”, etc. How can I beat handle those? What’s been your experiences in this situation?

Thanks to all.","Acknowledge the suck. When she says ‘I want to go home’ validate those feelings. Let her be sad because it IS a sad thing she’s dealing with. Grieve with her about this change.  Yes there’s a time to focus on the good, but let her grieve the bad too without glossing over it.
I like going about an hour or hour and a half before meal time. I usually bring my dad some food and a chocolate shake/ Coke Zero. He doesn’t have eat well with their food and that keeps us busy for a while talking about all the family and getting updates on life. It’s sad seeing him there. Sometimes I give him a hand massage because he talks about his hands cramping (could be lack of water or less function) The little things they can no longer enjoy because they don’t have people around to stop and smell the roses. They say touch is important. I Hate when he asks me to leave. Some visits are worse than others. Some are great with no “take me to the car” references.  My dad has not fell in love with his place yet and it’s been 3 months, although they are changing a med this week and I heard it’s waaaaaay better already. Wish me luck this weekend. We will see.

Edit: oh yea, first point, going before a mealtime like that allows you to tell them bye but “sit them at the table with friends” as it’s time for more food. Gives them a distraction when you leave.
I try to visit during the mornings because that is when my grandmother is ""at her best."" I also try to keep the visits relatively short to avoid getting to that point in the conversation where she asks how long she has to be there. But, if the question does arise, I simply tell her, ""As soon as your doctor says it's okay to go home."" That answer seems to satisfy her.

Honestly, after about a month, my grandma stopped asking all together because she really did start to love the facility and she became better acclimated to her new home. I bring her flowers and a treat with each visit to start off on a positive step. She's just happy to see me.
I'm sorry you and your wife are in this situation. We're in a very similar one here. 

I take care of my father at his home (we realized that he wasn't able to live alone when I came down for my monthly visit and things had really taken a huge turn) and my mother was placed in a MC community in July - Dad's decision. The first month was really rough. Dad finally went to see her after 3-4 weeks (the calming down period took a while) and I wasn't able to see her for a few months (I was in the doghouse for almost a year previous because, well, I was the one taking care of them and that's how it goes sometimes). Definitely validate her feelings, but deflect the decision to the doctors and/or change the subject. 

The suggestion to show up close to mealtime is a really good one. You have an ""excuse"" to leave, and you'll appreciate that.  The first visits work better if they're short visits. 

We try to bring her something to do - not every time - but large print word searches are something she enjoys even though it's really challenging because her ability to discern letters/words is decreasing.  You can bring in coffee and donuts or something she enjoys that is not complicated and easy to eat as long as she's not on any dietary restrictions. 

Enjoy any good times you have, and remember them when things get a little wild. This disease is like riding a rollercoaster. I wish you the best.
So sorry to hear about your situation. It’s always sad and heartbreaking. 

Try and bring some familiar things for your wife. We outfitted my dads place with some souvenirs he had purchased on trips over the years, and photos of him and family members. We also always try and bring a little treat when we visit- a soda, a chocolate, some candy, etc. 

Also- it’s nice to go to the dollar store to grab some decorations for holidays (Easter, Halloween, Christmas, etc)  - we have my dad help put them up each time, and it’s a nice activity we can do together at his new hope. 

We also made a photo book so that he can keep referencing his memories. Which has helped.
OP here. I should be able to visit this coming Wednesday or Thursday. Thanks for some very good thoughts and suggestions. Not sure if course, how it will be. She’s refusing any meds, so we’ll see. The important ones are the Olanzapine and her statin (her cholesterol was 331 when tested in San Diego). Thinking she’s just giving up?",2022-04-15 14:28:29,barryaz1,u4ehi1
Dementia,She's barely eating,"My MiL is barely eating.  We've been letting her (read: giving up fighting her about it) eat toast during the day (because we are not with her then and it's all she would eat, even if we, or the carers, prepare her anything). But she has tea with us every evening. She usually eats a small portion of whatever I prepare for her (I do her a separate dish to us, old fashioned 'traditional' English food). But just lately she is only eating 1 or 2 mouthfuls before announcing she is full.

She is looking a lot more frail, which I assume is nutrition related. I have tried making tea earlier, making tea later, going for stuff where she cleared the plate previously! Nothing is working.

She does seem to be eating some biscuits and sweets during the day (not many, but that in it's self is unusual). She has never eaten much of anything. She admits she is never hungry, but won't talk about it. She says if she didn't have to she wouldn't eat because she doesn't enjoy eating, never has. She also always thinks we have just eaten (as in, she think we had lunch recently).

I don't think it's about my cooking. and I make the type of dishes my FiL used to cook her. I go for soft and easy to eat foods (She has dentures).

Any suggestions for what to try her with? (Currently I give her Shepherds pie, fish cakes, fish fillets, pasties, mac & cheese, jacket potato's).  


**Edit -** The responses have shocked me. You all feel its quite significant and bad news. I wasn't prepared for that. I think I need a bit of time to get used to this. Ty for the helpful suggestions.  


**Edit #2** \- No more 'end stage' comments please. She isn't end stage. She looks after herself all day, she has never had a fall, she uses full sentences, can discuss her interests, dresses herself, can use the phone, can operate a TV remote, etc. ""one swallow doesn't make a summer"" (Pun intended)  


I will try less bland food.","This imo is one of the hardest parts of dementia. I know with my grandpa we got to a point where all he would eat is cookies and ice cream, that's it. We eventually had to figure that eating that's better than nothing, and if I ever get to be 95 I'll want to eat cookies and ice cream all the time even if I don't have dementia! Liquid supplements like smoothies and protein drinks are always good too if you can sneak them in. Just remember that this is the disease process and even if all she eats all day is toast, sweets, and tea, then that will at least give her calories. Wishing you all the best
Eating difficulties are [typical with dementia](https://www.scie.org.uk/dementia/advanced-dementia-and-end-of-life-care/end-of-life-care/eating-drinking.asp), especially toward the end-of-life stages.  She's likely just not feeling hungry or thirsty.
My mother is in hospice with dementia.   She also eats very little and I've been told it's okay. She's not feeling hungry and also, refusing food is one of the last things that people can control in their lives.   Having some control means a bit of dignity.

My mother, if she eats, tends to eat sweets.  Any calories at this point I think are fine.   It sounds like you are doing a good job in providing good meals, familiar dishes.
Yes to all of these.   Lost my mom in March after a slow 2 years and a really fast downhill 7 months.  She stopped eating a little less than a month before the end.  My blessings and sympathies.  Its time to consider comfort/palliative care
Chocolate protein shakes, you can freeze and blend to make them more like a milkshake, and grind her meds to put them in there too.
I've been buying Jelly Drops for my Mom (I'm also in the UK!) If you search for them online they're a company that make jelly sweets specifically for people with dementia. They are colourful and look very appealing, but they're just water and minerals, so it's a very easy way to get people to take fluids because most people are very happy to eat the 'sweets'! I know you mentioned that this issue is more food related, but I would highly recommend Jelly Drops as my Mom gladly eats them and I think that helps. They're not cheap but I don't really care at this point.
My great-aunt was in a similar period before. She would claim she's not hungry, even if she didn't eat the whole day. She only once asked for food, a very weird very rare type of dessert to be specific. Only grandma knew how to make it and when she ate, we made like a whole batch. Everyday we would try to trick her as ""(grand) Nephew/Niece X is trying to learn how to make, taste and give feedback please."" It worked for a while. 

Also, nutritional shakes are useful usually. I suggest talking to their principal physician for suggestions on what would fit their dietary requirements. 

Sorry you're going through this as a family, it must be very hard.
I'm going through something similar, and she's lost so much weight so fast it's concerning. At the moment, she also eats 3-4 spoonfuls and then she's declared she's full. So we give her liquid meal replacements like UpandGo to try and give her more calories, and whatever she feels like eating - she has a sweet tooth so cake or ice cream are her go tos for her difficult to eat days.
Dementia can cause long held likes and dislikes to change, including favorite foods and disliked foods. Sometimes family members get stuck in the rut of “she’s always liked this” or too hung up about nutrition, and this is inadvertently contributing to the lack of appetite. I have witnessed this with my family member. He loses weight and says he’s not hungry when staying in a particular environment and when he comes home to me he has a healthy appetite and gains weight. It’s not about being a good or bad cook. In general, people with dementia will gravitate to more strongly flavored foods. Sweets are a favorite. I hesitate to give specific food recommendations because I’m not in the UK. Don’t ask what she wants or expect her to come up with ideas. This is too tough for someone with dementia. Pick up a variety of prepared foods: plenty of snacks she can graze on and plenty of sweets. Rich, sinful, or the stuff you’d want to eat if you didn’t mind getting fat. Definitely cookies, ice cream, puddings, pastries. There are foods that tend to be sweet and extra flavorful too - such as Asian noodles and things with dipping sauces, fried sweet potato with sauce, etc. Experiment. The goal is just to get calories in her, regardless of the form they come in. 

If you have zero luck, there are medications that stimulate appetite. 

You haven’t said anything here that sounds like “end of life”. These food issues are common with dementia in people who are nowhere near end stage and there are solutions.
Virtual hugs... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRCV7DaiatI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRCV7DaiatI) might be an informative watch and listen.  It's always ok to encourage someone to eat/eat more and drink/drink more, but the decline in eating and drinking is natural.
My mom would eat lime yogurt. And liked sour stuff, like those sour popsicles they sell.
I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned this yet, but one thing a lot of people don't realize is your taste changes as you get dementia. Your sweet and salt receptors get duller. Your sour and bitter receptors are the last to go though. So food isn't going to taste as good. It's going to taste bitter instead of sweet. Everything will be bland and boring.

Unfortunately it could also mean she's reaching end stages. If she has a nurse that comes to visit, see what they say.
In patients with dementia, it’s possible that their interests in food and eating habits fluctuate. Unless she is starving and becomes very weak, it is okay. Try giving her a variety of things to eat and meal supplements such as Ensure.",2022-04-15 13:45:37,PerplePurp,u4djo6
Dementia,cameras in the room?,Anyone done this? Did it help you or your lo? Did you keep it hidden/secret?,"I got cameras and have to put them up. I have to walk dogs and this way I know if she falls. She can’t go out the door because we have chickens that will not let her all the way down the front ramp and chase her back in the house.
We have a camera in MIL room and will give us notifications if she gets out of bed in the night. Before this she has left her room and out of the house a couple times in the middle of the night. We have also added a baby gate at the top of the stairs for when  ( for what ever reason) the camera fails. This has all helped very much!
We don't have cameras in my MIL's room, but we do have a camera pointed at her door to alert us if she gets up, and a camera in the exit hallway if she gets past the door camera.
We put cameras around my MIL's home.  They were in plain sight and we had signs posted to inform her caregivers and visitors.  We only used them when concerned there might have been a problem (she wasn't answering her phone).  She knew we had them and it let us know when she was trying to change channels with her cellphone.  

Once we moved her to AL living the facility didn't allow cameras.  It makes things much harder.
I use an Alexa show.. I can drop in any time and look in and talk to him.
We had cameras on front and back doors. Also in the living room and kitchen. This was a small detached back house behind my sister’s house (50 feet or so). The cameras caught most of the common areas as it is a very small house. We also had Alexa which could “drop in” if necessary.",2022-04-15 11:39:03,BotherKey6043,u4asm1
Dementia,Talk to me about a sacral wound,"My father, 79yo with pretty severe dementia got several bedsores at a hospital back on Jan, this year. The ones on his heels (!!) are slowly improving (one is almost closed/healed), the other not so good but getting smaller weekly. 

The one at his sacrum is stage 3 now (into the muscle?). He has a wound dr that sees him weekly and nurses at his rehab facility do bandage changes daily. Depending on who I ask, this wound is large and ""pretty bad"". Not infected, just a large area and deep apparently.

I've been too afraid to look as I think I won't be able to ""un-see"" it afterwards. This is really traumatic for me already and I'm trying to safeguard myself :( 

Can anyone tell me about theirs, or their LO's, experience with one in that area? It seems like ANY position would be painful. Have any of you experienced improvement or healing with wounds like this? Is their any advice, encouraging words, etc...?

He is not currently mobile or else standing/walking would be the obvious move to take pressure off. We have been waiting months for heels to heal enough to allow weight to be put on his feet! 

Thanks","Do you have to look at it? If you don’t want to, try to give yourself permission to listen to your own boundaries.   If staff are doing dressing changes and he has a wound doctor it sounds like he’s got what he needs. They typically will up his protein intake since protein helps heal wounds. You can confirm that they’re doing this (with special shakes usually.) Staff should also be turning him every two hours but with his advanced dementia he might be turning back onto his back on his own because he can’t remember he’s not supposed to.
Skin is the largest organ of the body and often the first to show signs of the body starting to shut down. 

Can they reposition him every two to four hours to take pressure off his sacrum?
Sound like an alternating pressure air mattress topper would help.  I'd be surprised that one has not already been prescribed or provided by the care team.  They are cheap.  I bought one for my grandmother who had reoccurring pressure sores.  The one I got was about $80 on Amazon.

Our dad had dementia and we took care of him at home for 2 1/2 years. I was cleaning after he used the bathroom (he was still ambulating) and notice very small red spots. My CNA cousin told me to use butt paste, which cleared it right up. When he was no longer mobile, she and the hospice nurse stressed turning him and moving him every 2-3 hours, to prevent pressure wounds. 

Yes, the facility should be responsible for making sure it happens, but some facilities are short staffed. We were fortunate to know how to reposition him, how often and even learned to change the linen with him still in place.
It obviously will be uncomfortable.I worked with a lady who got an ungradable pressure sore on her lower spine so I have similar experience.
Lying on his side or on his back with a pillow along his lower spine to keep him off the wound. You can keep him in this position with some pillows.If you change sides regularly this can help him feel more comfortable. Maybe even invest in a haemorrhoid cushion with a hole to keep him off the wound

Don’t beat yourself up about not being able to see it.It’s an incredibly difficult thing that you’re dealing with and this is never something you could have been prepared for.I’m very squeamish myself and no you will never be able to unsee it. You aren’t doing him a disservice by not seeing it,you aren’t detached from his experience because you can’t see the wound. You’re struggling too and please don’t put more on yourself under a misguided sense of obligation.
Unless you have to, avoid it. Every sacral wound I have seen so far has been brutal and most smelled rancid. Nursing student that got assigned patients would already had wounds. Nobody developed any while I worked with them. Do keep a sharp eye on your father and gently hound the staff to take proper care. Talk with his wound team to get an idea of where he is at and what the next steps are.
I've seen a few pressure wounds in my time as a Nurse in Aged Care.

Honestly, sounds like a lot of actions are being taken which are appropriate....air mattress, regular offloading and repositioning, good and regular wound care.

Here's some further suggestions,
1. Ask if a wound swab has been taken at the site, often an infection will delay healing
2. Supplements added to fluids, for example enprocal
3. A referral to a wound care specialist
4. Good pain management!!!
My Dad was in hospice care and they swapped out his cheapo mattress with a deluxe air mattress when he could no longer get out of bed.  We were so proactive preventing the bedsores.  Yet the nurse ignored his constipation issues until it was too late.  A giant softball had grown inside him and they couldn’t get it out.  They sure tortured him at the end.
I used to be a CNA at a nursing home. If the administration and staff aren't helping, document the issues then call the health department. 


Keep a log. Write down every single time they come in to reposition him. When there's a gap of 121 minutes or more, report. Keep doing it. The health department can exert way more pressure on the nursing home than you can. 


It won't make you popular, but it works.
Please look at the wound. My mom went into a rehab and came out with a heal wound. The most up setting part is how your loved ones go for healing but come home with something or worse. The heal they claimed wasn't serious but it did get infected at home not sure how but it did. But you can't see how things are going or ask questions if you don't how it changes. Hopefully you have a A1 facility. As much as I hate look at my
Moms wound I hate when something goes wrong and we have to start at square one.
Take this with a grain of salt because I might be jaded from being an EMT but pressure wounds (to me) often don't look horrendous. I've seen ones that were, but it was mainly because they had not been cleaned and re-bandaged correctly for weeks. A clean and well-tended pressure wound essentially looks like a huge bursted blister, even the stage 3 ones. I'm not suggested you go look at it, that's totally your call. 

Yes they can heal from that point if the person is willing to cooperate fully with turns every two hours and trying to get sat up in a chair. When people are at end of life (like weeks or days left) they probably won't heal though.",2022-04-15 08:16:06,BotherKey6043,u46qho
Dementia,My new spiritual perspective,"I’ve been grieving mom’s dementia for several weeks now and recently I had a moment of grace where I thought the following.

Mom isn’t gone.  She’s still here.  But the parts that aren’t have ascended to a higher level.  Call it heaven, soul, nirvana, enlightenment etc.  she gets confused because she’s beyond the world I live in.  It’s not that she’s losing it.  I’m 44 and if you put me in a group of teenagers, chances are I wouldn’t understand much of their dialogues and dynamics, because I’m no longer a teen.  So it makes sense that if I partially moved beyond this world that things would be off for me.   Honestly I am excited to be exposed to her world more.  Today I overheard her talking about the color of the trees swirling.  That sounds beautiful.  I realized this evening that I fully believe this to be fact and with that i have acceptance and am no longer traumatized in grief.","There’s a book called “On Vanishing” by Lynn Casteel Harper that I’ve been dipping in and out of that gets into a more spiritual lens on dementia I find interesting (I’m about to turn 41 and have a mother with dementia so I’m right behind you…hugs). I’ve tried to find the grace in it alongside the grief. In these early-middle stages, at least, she has been vulnerable and open with me in a way she never was when I was younger, and letting me return the care for her has been humbling. She said to me a few months ago, “sometimes I can’t remember if I’m the mom or I’m the daughter,” which still makes me tear up with both grief and gratitude that she feels safe with me.
Exactly! Our dad died from dementia. We learned to meet him in his world, wherever he was. It changed from day to day, even hour to hour. This really became important when he couldn’t find the right words to say what he wanted, we learned his language💔",2022-04-14 22:10:53,ImpersonalLubricant,u3xh08
Dementia,mom not making any sense anymore,My mom has been rapidly declining over the past few months and it’s getting to the point  where I get frustrated because I don’t know what she’s saying. I really try to understand what she means but it just doesn’t make any sense. I’m trying my best not to get discouraged since I know this is a clear indicator of her alzheimer’s getting worse. Does anyone have any advice on how to have a conversation and not get frustrated? Thanks in advance!,"No real advise, my moms at the same point; declining rapidly and speech is a word salad.  So far I just roll with it and build a back and forth banter but I think it's frustrating her.  I'm not sure if she doesn't know what's going on or if she just can't express herself.  I was thinking of getting or making a small set of cards you see used for helping kids with autism express themselves but for general conversation.  

Maybe like:   I like, I need, You , plant, flower, drink, candy, dinner, nap, etc.

Everything with mom is a moving target.  You figure out one thing and something else pops up.
It's so hard deciphering what they're trying to say and it's also exhausting. I wish I had advice but I think it's more about reminding yourself that they't sick. It's also scarier and worse for them than it probably is for us. It's hard. I snap all the time and its not kind of me \~ still trying to figure it out myself
New to this reddit.

My Mom had a massive stroke a few years back which manifested itself in declined cognitive skills once she recovered.  Her dependence on others for daily tasks required that she be moved to assisted living.  Last Christmas she seemed the most talkative she has ever been.  I actually felt like she finally was coming out of her shell.  Sadly today she has been moved into hospice and has a FAST score of 7A.  In a matter of a couple of months her dementia escalated to the point that she no longer recognizes anyone in the family and conversations are a jumbled mess of words if she even attempts to speak at all.  Our family has a history of AD, so between the stroke and AD, she went from a vibrant outgoing woman to this in just a few years of time.  She is 81 now.

The hardest part is trying to talk to her.  Not knowing if it is her brain not connecting the dots or if there really isn't anything in there anymore.  With the stroke, her brain had to rewire itself just to relearn how to talk, swallow and the like.  So for a while she would be doing one thing in her head, but her body would do something else.  It was playing tricks on her.  Now with the advanced dementia, it's far worse than it was after the stroke.  I can see why she would not want to say anything if no one seems to understand what it is she is saying anymore.  

The idea of picture cards seems to make sense, but that assumes her brain is capable of telling her hand which card to show.  With her stroke in the past, the brain didn't make the right connections, so I'm thinking the same may be happening as well now.

I just don't know if she's trapped in her body being unable to communicate with us or literally non-communicative.  So many things I would have liked to say to her but am unable.  Much like with my father who passed back in 2015.

If I've learned anything through all this is that waiting to say anything to your loved ones for the right moment is a mistake.  That right moment may be too late.  You think you have time, but you don't.  My family was never all that communicative about such things, so it was only natural to put things off.  It was just the way we were.  Now it's like, so many missed opportunities.

I know this isn't much help, but maybe knowing that things could already be far worse might help you to navigate through this time.  I found that letting her talk, incoherent as it may be, and nodding as if I understood, made her feel part of this world.  This of course was before the decline to where she is now.  She doesn't even attempt to talk anymore.  So it's more me having a conversation with myself.  I picture her staring at this stranger wondering why they are here talking to me about things I know nothing about.  As long as she isn't getting frustrated or agitated, I think it gives me some comfort knowing that I am at least there.
Well if she can’t keep the conversation you can just keep it going on your side as if it were normal. Like how you’d talk to a baby? Not quite like that obviously, not with the baby voice but you know like people talk to their babies in pretty much a conversation that only has one person verbalizing. But it’s still a connection and could still be really nice for your mom. So I guess just like keep talking to her and if she says something you don’t understand give it a pleasant acknowledgment “oh you think?” “Oh I see!” And keep going.
Just smile and agree. My mom is in year 6 now. She actually does not even say much now. The answer for so many of these things is patience. When I think of all she did for me, I find the will. She would want me to pay it forward to my kids and would be mortified at all of this.",2022-04-14 19:40:46,mangooomadness,u3ulvd

Dementia,Dad is becoming combative and abusive,"My parents live on a large piece of land that slopes down. Lots of vegetation. It gets slippery. Dad enjoys moving rocks from one spot to another. He can do this for hours. 

It would probably be ok if the ground was flat. It would probably be ok if he was steady on his feet. But a month ago it looked like he wrestled with some thorny branches and the wounds on his legs got infected. I’m talking green puss infection surrounded by bright red skin. 

A visiting nurse was sent because we couldn’t get him to the doctor. He refused to get in the car. He also wouldn’t stay out of the back area of the house. There’s a gate halfway. My brother and I bought locks and chains. He was able to break the gate hinge  off the fence. 

We fixed it again made it more secure and hid anything that he could potentially use to break through.

This morning he began a tirade directed towards my brother. Then he grabbed my brother by the front of his shirt and began screaming in his face. 

He has threatened to slash the tires on the car. The other day I caught him just before he swung a metal pipe at the windshield of my rental car. 

He regularly tells me to go to hell. Said he doesn’t have a daughter anymore, says I’m the devil.

And here is the heartbreaking part…he has started to force himself on my Mom. She even bought him his own bed and set it up in the main living room area. I know he has dementia but this is abuse. 

I don’t know what to do. I leave next week and the guilt of leaving is tearing me up. I’ve been here 3 weeks. He needs more care than what he’s getting. 

In February he fell 3 times in the span of a week. I can’t keep flying here - this is my 3rd trip in a year. 

Just venting really.","I am so sorry. Respectfully, for your mother's safety he needs to be removed to a safe and secured facility. By all means, contact Adult Protective Services. Respectfully check into a legal process to see if he can be declared incompetent. A physician visit would be mandatory.
Oh boy, I am so sorry.  If you're in the US, maybe call adult protective services for help? It sounds like your mom is in a dangerous situation...
If he is hell-bent on self-destruction, there is not much you can do short of calling adult protective services or getting him on the  hospital on a mental health hold when he has an episode. If he refuses to leave and see a doctor, please take your mom with you. Next time he could swing that metal pipe at her head.
My father was becoming abusive towards us and threatening his own life and ours. We ended up getting him admitted into a mental hospital for a hold to be evaluated. Baker acting him was the best decision for us to get help in regards to his dangerous behavior
An infection like the one from his injury tends to lead to bizarre behaviors, hallucinations, and outbursts.  

If the infection is still present in some capacity, it may be causing these severe changes. Or at least exacerbating them.

Medications like Seroquel will typically calm these behaviors down significantly in the interim.

If he is already falling often, other antipsychotics like Abilify, Risperdal, Haldol, zyprexa, geodon, etc should not be used at all.
We took my grandfather getting combative as a sign that it was time to move him to memory care, because they have security and such. It ended up working out okay, aside from a few fist fights he got into with other residents. Though luckily for us, the combativeness was a phase. (Mostly - he was still trying to fight the EMTs two days before he died, but it was getting less frequent.) He got easier to handle as his memory got worse. Is that an option for you?

Dementia,Dad resistant to any help and in denial,"Looking to vent but also see if anyone has been in this situation. My dad (68) is adamant that he is healthy and doing just fine, but obviously that's not true. He is barely functioning from day to day and is just scraping by in life while living alone. I often hear all about how my siblings and I keep on visiting and abandoning him (not true, we live across the country but have local family members we rely on), people are always ""in and out"" of his house, and he has been talking about those who have passed like they are here. He thinks I live down the street, and has reverted to talking about ""his wife"" who he divorced over 20 years ago and previously hated. All this is to say that he is often confused, talking about things that never happened.

Dad is simply DONE with doctors. This was an attitude he had before we noticed the signs of dementia. I contacted his doctor a year ago to explain what we were seeing. He found out and thought I was incredibly out of line and lying. This was the nail in the coffin for him getting medical help. It is listed in his records that he does not want to pursue any help with his cognition (I have access to his account). The MRI is showing large dead spots, including a big chunk of his cerebrum. He is suffering from vascular dementia, but smokes a pack a day, doesn't eat, and is no longer taking his meds. But he is FINE and everything is GOOD and he is just so BUSY all the time living his life! He doesn't want help, doesn't need it, and will get incredibly nasty if you overstep and make it impossible to help. We have been noticing a decline for almost 5 years.

We are now at the point where it is completely unsafe for him to be driving and living alone. The other night he thought his phone was broken and went out looking for a pay phone, which he didn't find obviously. We're very lucky he ""found"" a convenience store he frequents, and the owner helped him contact us. He is going to start a fire with his cigarettes. He is unsteady on his feet and is falling; refuses to even entertain the idea of a cane. I have no idea if he is still on blood thinners, but he is still bleeding everywhere with the smallest cut. We are in a precarious situation where SOMETHING is going to happen, and god forbid it affects anyone else. 

Any ideas on how we can navigate this? If we send a caregiver over, he WILL turn them away. He will not sign any POA papers. He will not give up his license, and I'm not sure he would even respond to a notice to come in and get tested at the DMV. He will not move to an assisted home. He is answering his phone less and less. And if any of us kids take him in or move in, he will not listen to rules like ""you cannot chain smoke in the house"" because he believes he is justified to do what he wants, when he wants. He will not allow family members to check on him. Couldn't even get him to go to the doctor with a trusted friend. Many family members have talked to him nicely, I've cried to him, brothers have yelled at him. Can't kill him with kindness, but also can't force him to do what's necessary.","Unfortunately you can’t control dad or save him from his own self-destruction, but you do need to try to prevent him from driving. Whether by changing the locks on his car, or somehow otherwise making the car fail to start up. A car is a 2-ton deadly weapon, if he hits and destroys property or even kills people, you could find yourself liable for having known about the dead spots in his brain and “allowed” him to continue driving.
Are you in the US? This sounds like a situation for adult protective services
If you're in the US, you can report your father to the DMV. As a former police officer I have seen too many instances of avoidable death and injury when someone who should no longer be driving causes a terrible accident. One time we managed to stop a man in his 70s who was driving the wrong way on a major interstate ( he didn't notice that he was seeing the back of the signs) on Christmas morning. Can you imagine if he had hit a minivan full of kids on their way to see Grandma?  We got his son to come get him (had the car towed) and he said that they'd just ""let Dad drive in the neighborhood"". Yeah - no. I reported him to the DMV because I wouldn't have been able to live with myself if I found out that he ran over some kid on a bike or something. 

My Dad will DEFINITELY lose his license when it's time. We had to do it with Mom 5 years ago. It's really hard because it takes away so much of their independence, but it's the responsible thing to do.
I am so sorry, our dad died from dementia. Respectfully,  I would try, thru the courts, to have him declared incompetent. A medical exam would be mandatory, and it sounds like your dad would lose. It sounds like he would not show up or show up and not be able to defend himself properly. We were so blessed we had no problems with our dad at all other than sundowning at night. We took his car keys early on and made a set of ""keys"" for him and $10 one-dollar bills for his pocket. We had decided when he was unable to live alone, we would rotate in and out to take care of him, but didn't know ""when"". He latched the screen door on his way in the middle of subzero weather.  A neighbor saw him, pried the door open and called me. That was our ""when"".
Someone in the family needs to go see an Elder Attorney.  The attorney will be able to tell you what can and can't be done.  Most important though, as others say, the car needs to be disabled as soon as possible.  He is an accident waiting to happen and no one would want him to hurt or kill someone. Good luck.
Can't you report him for his driving so that he HAS to take a test in order to keep his licence? Not sure how it works where you are but that's how it works here.
Maybe try calling the ALZ association. They're very kind and might offer more resources/ideas. Or honestly just a genuine listening ear. Because he's potentially a danger to himself/others they might lead you in the right direction",2022-04-14 12:14:12,muttmuttduck,u3l3tx
Dementia,"Father with Parkinson's calls late at night, poor relationship (long ramble sorry)","My 68yo dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease around 8 years ago. He had to retire from his main job but I think he is still quite active. I live quite far away from him. He has issues with short-term memory and comprehending complex things. He lives alone but has a girlfriend who lives in a neighboring town. Their relationship is awful and they seem to fight whenever they have contact. She's a pretty horrible person and I don't know why they have stayed ""together"". He has always been quite narcissistic and psychologically abusive to his girlfriend and also previously towards my mother (physically and psychologically). We have never had a close relationship and he was not really involved in my upbringing, except when I used to visit him as a child for school holidays.

During the past couple of years he has been through some periods of really dementia-ish behavior but probably more delerium, like night-time anxiety and calling at crazy hours like after midnight, freaking out because he is having normal (?worsening) Parkinson's symptoms. He hadn't been taking his melatonin and wasn't sleeping well. That seems to have settled down. He frequently fails to take his Parkinson's medications on-time. It's probably partly forgetfulness and partly denial / not thinking he needs to. He will often wait until his symptoms get bad which is then too late. He says he sees a different doctor each time he visits the medical practice but I still think he would have been advised about the importance of taking the meds regularly and on time regardless of current symptom severity. He has dyskinesia now (involuntary movements). He won't allow anyone to accompany him to the doctor.

He has generally refused home help even though he does not cook - his kitchen doesn't even have an oven and his girlfriend says he won't even microwave himself something. He just eats out for every meal, basically, or goes to his girlfriend's house. He does not use the pill boxes we bought for him to carry his meds so that he has some pills handy in all the places he goes such as the car, his home, his girlfriend's home, and previously his work briefcase. Back in around 2018 I had to write to his doctor about his driving as people from his church noticed him driving home late at night, weaving all over the road ""as if he was drunk"". He passed his driving test anyway. For years his teeth have looked terrible and he clearly wasn't brushing. When I visited him I saw a very old, mangled-looking toothbrush in the bathroom when I had recently ordered groceries for him which included a new toothbrush. When I asked him where it was he said he had already used it up and thrown it away (clearly not true as the one he had there looked ancient). Years ago I ordered him some assistive aids for Parkinson's such as buttoning loops/hooks to help with doing up buttons, key and tap turners, a Liftware spoon which compensates for tremor movements, etc. He has stashed all these things under the bed and they have never been opened.

My sibling and I have really tried to help in many ways over the years, like trying to help him fix issues with his home that for some reason he hasn't been able to organise himself, and arrange an assessment for in-home services but it didn't really go well and his doctors don't seem interested in assessing his cognitive function. If you call or write to them they regard you as a controlling family member and nobody has any power to make him get assessed, so nothing happens. Everyone gives lip service to ""early diagnosis"" being important but nobody ever actually seems to want to assess for or diagnose dementia. I have also found this in my work life (I work in health). We have kind of given up. When we have tried to make suggestions and help him in the past he's become combative and mean and we have never really had a close relationship anyway. I feel a bit guilty for not picking up every time he calls but I cannot for my own sanity.

He has been calling me quite often, not every night but sometimes consecutive nights in a row depending on what's going on at the time. For the past year-and-a-half, I would guess that his calls to me are averaging once every 2 days but he will often call me multiple times in one day. I have a child to look after and I don't like talking to him. He always expects me to stroke his ego and repeats the same things, wants to talk about his time in the Army and asks me about my life which I don't really want to share because he then blabs things to my other abusive family members. In the past we have never really had frequent phone calls and it just feels inappropriate and weird now. It's just awkward and unpleasant for me and a chore, and he will go on and on and not understand that my child needs me. Talking to him is draining and he still treats me like I am a child (I'm 38). He always wants to bitch about other family members, evaluate everyone's life-choices and talk about himself. I still feel like I have to do what he wants because of how authoritarian he was when I was a kid (and still is). I understand that in his situation he's isolated and trying to hold on to his dignity and self-respect and wants to feel heard and relevant like his opinions matter, and I do do that for him sometimes. Often he will call under the pretense of ""seeing how I am going"" and put on this excessive fake concern about me when he has never really asked or cared in the past because he has had better things to do and I find it really uncomfortable.

I don't really know what I want with this post, maybe just support? I just needed to vent about how frustrating the situation is and how sometimes you can't really do anything. He has lots of acquaintances, goes to church, has always been very extroverted, even forcefully so with people. He kind of pressures people to be his friend and talk to him. He is a skilled manipulator and good at appearing to be a ""great guy"" who everyone likes but deep-down he is very self-centred and does not feel remorse when he is abusive towards others. He will never apologise for his actions and is now more prone to emotional outbursts if you try to hold him accountable for things he says or does.

Just wondering if anyone else has a similar situation and anything that's been helpful? Basically I understand he's lost many outlets including his work and a significant amount of function (eg., he doesn't drive much now), and expects me to fill in the blanks for him. He is involved with the local returned serviceman's club and has reconnected with his old Army mates. I think that at times he just gets ""the fear"" and wants/needs to be talked down, but I can't do that for him every time he wants it. It does seem like a bit of a transition into him being more childlike.","It may be time to get him assigned his POA since he can’t care for himself .
Is your dad taking a dopamine agonist? Mirapex, requip, or neupro patch?  

A lot of what you said sounds like side effects of these Parkinson's drugs.",2022-04-14 11:10:50,Intrepid-Rhubarb-705,u3jq69
Dementia,"My dad is 64 years old. We just got the diagnosis, he has dementia. I’m devastated.","Title says it all. We’ve known for over 2 years something was wrong. Thanks to my mom and her stubbornness, now we have a diagnosis. Prognosis is bad. I’m devastated and heartbroken. Me (33F), my sister (42F) and my mom (65F) are his support system, but both my sister and I have been living away from home for +10 years. 

Advice and/or kind words would be appreciated.","Definitely make sure you and your sister take turns (or visit together) to give your mom a break on occasion.

Your mom will need to get all their financials in order, make sure their wills and advanced care directives are up to date, and include you and your sister as alternate designees on all important papers, in case something happens to you mom and she can’t take care of your dad.  She needs to add either or both of you on all documents.

Eventually your mom might need to put your dad in a memory care unit if he becomes too difficult to care for. This could be physical issues (if he loses the ability to stand, wrt going to the bathroom, bathing, etc) or emotional problems where he could become combative.
May Orion's stars shine brightly over you and yours.
Make sure all financials POA, wills etc are in order. Prepare. It’s hard. Make sure there’s enough money. Eventually you won’t be able to be her only caregiver and you’ll need help. Just prepare for the future as painful as it is. I’m a few years ahead of you on this.
Every caretaker has a different way of relating to their loved one and a different style. I can't get my mother to bathe, but one of her caretakers has no problems with that. Don't get into arguments about differences in how you guys take care of your dad: what works for one won't work for the other and you all love him and want to do your best. It's easy to see fault when you're not the one doing it.
I'm so sorry. It's excruciatingly difficult to watch your parent, someone that you've looked up to all your life as a great shining star disintegrate before your eyes. My advice is only that you stop whatever you're doing, no matter how important it seems at the time, when your father  shows any sign of clarity or lucidity, just stop and focus on him and interact, because those moments become less frequent and shorter as time goes on, and you never know when the last one is going to be so don't miss it.
Are the doctors working to diagnosis the type of dementia? Alzheimer’s, Lewy Body, vascular, fronto-temporal? These all have different symptoms and life expectancies. 

If the money is available, I would suggest introducing your father to caregivers now - either an adult day center or in-home caregiving. My rationale was to get my husband used to it early, before the dementia got so bad that he was resistant to having others take care of him. 

I also toured memory care facilities with my husband and filled out the paperwork so that he could be admitted to one immediately if necessary. He has Lewy Body Dementia and I know of cases where things deteriorated quickly and the caregiver was left to quickly search for a good facility. 

We are in the USA, it may be very different in your country.
This is very tough. You have my sympathy. My Dad was diagnosed quite late into his illness (long after family had seen signs) and I was his caregiver for his last years. He just recently passed after a long “battle”. 

I do not envy you the journey you are embarking on but perhaps could offer some suggestions that would make your experience better than mine (if only slightly). I should mention that these are mostly practical suggestions and are not “kind words” or intended to be hopeful. 

First, be honest and transparent with your father about the situation — especially early on. Later on, it’s not going to matter whether he understands his diagnosis. But, for now, honesty and transparency will help really optimize the time you have left with him. And, by that, I mean the time you have left with him as you remember him now. Enjoy it! Enjoy spending time with your Dad. 

I would give anything to be able to spend time with my Dad as he was before this awful illness — even in the early stages. 

Second, start caregivers as soon as possible. Normalize having care workers in the home while he is still relatively lucid. Setup a schedule for physical therapy (for balance or anything physical), occupational therapy, etc. Your Mom should not try to take on the entire burden as I did. It only gets harder to bring in the care workers later. Do it now.

Third, your mom is still around so that’s helpful but make sure financial affairs are in order. Setup a durable power of attorney right now and have that in place for the inevitable.

Fourth, if you haven’t already, setup a medical power of attorney and make a decision on a DNR. Trust me when I say that by the end, there will be no need for extreme measures or life saving efforts. There is no quality of life for the dementia sufferer to come back to.

Finally, just be involved. It’s difficult for everyone but make sure everyone is included and that they understand the situation. Do not sugar coat things and trivialize his condition. Be honest with everyone involved in his care (family included) and explain what everyone can do to help. All too often, family let’s the burden fall to one member and resentment builds. Help each other. It’s horrible for everyone but share the load.

Again, my sympathies. Truly a horrible situation that I would not wish on anyone. Take advantage of the time you have with your Dad now because dementia will silently steal him from you (and from himself) day by day, month by month.
Devastating news indeed. Stay strong and support your mom if she will be the primary caregiver. Also, create and execute a plan for caregiving and other important tasks/ decisions.
In kindness I will say please don't call your Mom stubborn.  She is the one living with your Dad and I can understand her not wanting to confirm what she probably already knew.  You think you are devastated, think what it means for her.  Her life, as she knows it, is close to being over as she moves into caretaker mode.  You have no idea what it takes to be a caretaker 24/7, or what it is like to watch your husband slowly deteriorate day by day.  It will be a time for you and your siblings to step up and help her as your Dad progresses. The most loving thing you can do is to be supportive and make it a rule between you and your siblings that you will be proactive in giving your Mother a break on a regular basis.  What she will need is the gift of your time. It can be very lonely, it can be very sad, it can be very depressing, it can be very tiring when you are the only one taking care of a loved one with dementia. Be her support while she cares for him.
Dementia sucks.

 Our dad died in June, there were 4 1/2 of us that took care of him, round the clock, in his home for 2 1/2 years. We decided we did not want to place him, all but one of us was retired (she was the 1/2!) We could only manage 4-5 days each, then rotate out. It was a challenge. Fortunately, he had signed POA and POHC papers years ago and I was on his checking account. It was hard for us, but we would do it again. His primary doctor was an angel and supported us with whatever we needed.  He told us when it was time for hospice. Your mother will need a lot of support. Caregivers burn out is real. Try to spend as much time with her as you can to give her a break. Our dad was 90 when he passed
It's definitely a one day at a time journey that will challenge everyone in his support circle, no way to sugar coat that but here are the biggest tips that have helped our families. Highly encourage mandatory 24 hour breaks for the mental and physical health of the primary caretakers to recharge and renew. And activities in the early stages like completing The Old Untold. A book with a 101 questions about a person's history i.e. their old untold. It has been helpful for caretakers to understand an event or a person that your dad may reference on the non-lucid days. Plus it's a great keepsake for you and the family share a part of his personal history. Surround him with tasks that he's use to doing. An example if he filled out forms all day long get him a bunch of blank forms and a fancy pen. Tasks or assignments are key to keeping him more lucid. Coded locks for all exits if he starts to wander and don't be alarmed if nudity becomes a thing. Clothing for some (especially men) can feel suffocating. I really hope this helps. This groups is full of supportive people that are in your shoes or have been there with their loved ones.
I’m sorry to see this … just be patient … that was my struggle at the beginning … my dad was always sharp, so when he started to struggle it was hard to get used to … and as the disease progressed, so did my patience … you can red about this disease but nothing will prepare you for experiencing it 1st Hand in a loved one … love them and care for them and DON’T refuse help … it was heartbreaking when we put my dad in a long term care facility, but we quickly realized that the nurses that care for dementia patients are incredible !!!
I don't have anyone in my family with dementia but I work with people with dementia daily. It's a really hard diesease for the family I find more so then the person in some situations. it can be really hard but my biggest advice is to find some positives in it. Some times the diesease can cause some funny moments, and try to find some connection when you can. Dementia is very different in everyone so it may be slow. 

If you have any questions, feel free to DM
Dementia is devastating, just make sure to not lie to him or let him get lost in his own world. Try to redirect him back to reality and don’t tell him he’s wrong. It’ll just confuse him even more than he already is. If you need anything don’t be afraid to shoot me a dm

Dementia,Anyone else in their young-mid 20's as a caregiver for their parent? (Venting),"My mom (67) has been showing signs of dementia for the past 5 years and ever since her mom died July 2021 the deterioration has been rapid. I don't feel like I can take care of her. For my mental health I am planning on moving out sometime with all the right measures in place so she is safe but boy do I feel like a shitty daughter. She's been in denial of these issues for the entirety of showing symptoms and has never been checked out properly. Before the dementia she was also extremely emotionally abusive and neglectful (narcissist). I lose my cool so easily over small things because it all just feels so unfair. Why should I now have to fill in this caregiver role when she was never a caregiver to me as a young child? Why is it that I say something she doesn't like I start receiving endless hurtful ultimatums, name calling, etc. I could go on of course but there really isn't any point. On top of that I'm not working so I don't feel like I have much going for me, fear resenting her for having to take a large pause on my life, and face her deteriorated decision making skills, long-term & short-term memory, inability to do simple tasks, etc. It's all just so fucking sad. I love her and hate to see her like this. She can't help it and I know it's only going to get worse. I know that this will be the hardest thing I have to face and it's also hard not knowing anyone my age who has gone through something similar. I feel so envious of my peers lives. I wish I could just focus on myself and not worry so much or have so much responsibility. The day to day interactions with her are the hardest. My patience has run so so thin and I snap so much and she doesn't deserve that! None of this is fair for anyone, and I am so tired. Grieving sucks and I wonder if it will get any easier.","I am sorry you are going through this OP.

I get angry with my husband every day, and I know I’m burnt out just slowing my pace to accommodate his.  Drs won’t give us a diagnosis, so we are in endless limbo (going on 5th hear). He is very limited in what he can do, and has a lot of issues processing instructions.  Conversations are slow, and difficult. He’s the one with dementia and I am the one with the outbursts of anger which seems wrong.

Try not to be hard on yourself OP. Have someone to back you up, get out with your friends so this part of your life doesn’t overtake you. Don’t feel bad if you feel you aren’t the best person to provide your mom’s care.
Don’t be upset with yourself
It’s a terrible disease
My father has just been deported from Indonesia (lived there last 10 years with wife and 2 kids under 6)
I helped get him back urgently and now he is showing significant signs of dementia
I had to do the hospital drop off two weeks ago and it was hard, waiting 5 hours in emergency for them to take him in for more testing/care as myself or my 3 older siblings didn’t have the time or space to care for him 24/7 as he just came back so quickly.

It’s a terrible disease- my father called me 30 times a day and each call is a different story 
If he seems me in person he does not remember me except for the prick who dropped him off in some hellhole of a hospital (it isn’t and the staff are amazing and caring and he is safe there)

Sorry for rant but don’t feel you are doing anything bad- you have your life and need to live it- living Groundhog Day will be detrimental to your health also.

Hope all goes well
28 here my grandmother is 71 and we just lost my old man which is why I now take care of her
Hey, 22 yr old here with 64 yr old dad with mid stage dementia. Me and my mom care for him but he's definitely a handful at times, I completely understand what you're going through.

Dementia,Is it OK to visit her old house?,"I'm not even sure how to ask about this. 

Short-ish version:

I want to know if it's OK to have my mom over to *her own house* for holidays. 

My only experience with this sort of thing is with my spouse's family situation. With their family, they do not let the grandma go to her old house any more. She gets upset and doesn't want to leave. I was told by my wife not to bring my mom back to her old home, as it would cause trouble or upset her like how her grandma got upset. Both my wife's grandma and my mom have to go back to their nursing homes each day, so they can't stay at their old homes. They both have Alzheimer's, but it hasn't progressed so far for them not to remember their old houses. 

Long version: 

My mother is in skilled nursing / memory care. I sometimes take her out to places for lunch, ice cream, or go shopping. I have to make sure to get her back to the nursing home every time, because it's important for her to always take her scheduled medicine (and have nurses available around the clock). 

She still owns her house, and I've been taking care of it for years.

Since she hasn't been there in a long time, most of her possessions are gone, things have been fixed up, some rooms have been repainted, there are new appliances, and the yard looks different. I basically tried fixing it up, just in case we had to sell it to pay for my mom's care. 

Well, Medicaid took care of things, and they said that we can keep the house. 

So then we had this nice house, all fixed up. We have been wanting to do more things there. We did Halloween there, and we want to do Easter over there. My wife and I have been looking into selling our house for a while (since before my mom went into memory care), so it actually works out well for us to stay at my mom's house. I talked to my mom about this already,
and she thought it would be a good idea for me to stay there to make sure it was taken care of. 

I was thinking about getting my mom for Easter and having her join us, but I don't know if that is a good idea. I don't want to make her upset. I would also feel real guilty about doing stuff with family but not have my mom there at her own house. 

But I'm afraid that she might see her old house and not want to leave. Or maybe she will see her old house, realize how much of it has changed and get really upset. It's also possible that she won't remember the house at all. 

Has anyone else been in a situation like this?","The one piece of advice that I got from probably 25 different people (including those at my mom's facility) is to NOT take them out.  For the exact reason you say - they won't want to go back.  Go and visit her.  Most of the time they don't even realize it's a holiday/birthday/special occasion, so it won't matter if you visit the day before or the day after.
If you host a gathering, at her house, I suggest you not invite her. Make alternate plans, e.g., going out the night before to a restaurant or your home.

My experience is my own. We had our grandfather in a nursing home, but kept his rental apartment, the controlled rent was cheaper than a storage locker. He was in his 90s, but my mom was reluctant to liquidate his belongings for some reason. Likely out of respect for Grandpa.

We kept the unit basically the same, with some well needed cleaning. Over the 20+ years he lived there with his deceased wife, the apartment was adapted to accommodate a wheel chair, with grab bars, ramp, etc.. However, when Grandpa came to visit he was distraught it wasn’t as he remembered it. Who knows what period in his long-term memory he was referencing.",2022-04-14 02:01:03,BitingChaos,u3aiaa
Dementia,My momma is on her finally journey soon. Please pray for her. Her name is Sandee.,"As incredibly difficult as a journey that this has been, I know I’ve given it my all, and I have no regrets. 

My heart is heavy right now but I also feel happiness and joy that her fight and struggles will soon be over. 

You have all been so amazing and I am forever grateful for this group. I will continue to be here for others that may just be starting their journey even when ours is over. 

Thank you all!

Update: Mom got her wings yesterday and thank the Lord she’s free from that horrid disease! Thank you again for all the wonderful support! She’s at peace now and yes I’m sad- but I’m mostly relieved for her.","Your job is complete. You carried her to the finish line. You did great. May her memory be a blessing.
You’ve done your part … when my dad passed, I didnt realize what a blessing it was until I was able to take a breath … I’m not saying it in a selfish way …, it was a blessing because he’s now with my mother, his wish the moment she died 3 yrs earlier … She died March 2017, dad died Feb 2020 … even in the fog, he wanted to be with her … his wish was granted and his suffering over
May her end journey be peaceful as she finally is released from this illness.  May you find joy in the memories of when she was whole.
I'm wishing your mother a peaceful voyage.  And I'm wishing you strength and grace to help her through.  Sending love through the internet waves.
God Bless you and peace to you and your mom.
I pray her passage will be peaceful for you both. I understand what you mean, I was crushed about no longer having my mother with me, but equally thankful that she was free.",2022-04-13 22:47:17,realblondee,u37aol
Dementia,I’m a activities aid at my local nursing home working on our dementia floor,"So many emotions. Sometimes the most beautiful moments in the world then suddenly your hit by like a semi with some of the most brutal things you can see, experience, and have told to you directly. I love my residents but my heart broke today after being told I’m a worthless pile of shit and should thrown my self off the nearest bridge. I absolutely know that is not who they are, and under normal circumstances they would most likely never speak like that. I misdirect, put on everyone’s favorite Elvis, and help calm them down from what ever it is they are going through… but it still hurts man.

All you need is love

Edit: thank you for all the love, I don’t normally have any issues with what I’m told but I need to develop better Teflon emotions and let what they say slide off me and give them all the love in the world.","Ugh what a hard hard job. Thank you so much for doing it. My mom doesn’t have anyone caring for her yet but I dread the day when she does. She has a personality disorder and can be a mean malicious lady. Right now my dad still has her under his care at home. But my hat’s off to you guys working with them because it seems so unpredictable and jarring the ways they can act. Thank you thank you thank you. It’s never about you personally- you just have to remember that and not go too far with the job if it’s too much to handle emotionally.
When I was a paramedic we had to go to a memory care unit,  some of the things they would say to us were outrageous!  It got to the point that we had fun comparing who this one resident had roasted the worse.  She would tell the guys to lick her pu\*\*y,  we of course are ugly, spit at us,  could out cuss a sailor, you name it, she said it,  it became just so funny to us.   For the record,  she had been a preacher in her earlier life.  I know she would have been horrified had she known what she was doing.

Hang in there,  you do a job most people could never do.
Pretty natural to internalize what someone says and take it personally. Even if you know someone doesn't know you, it still makes you think. You just have to remember that you are dealing with very sick people and the disease sometimes makes them mean. The underlying feeling to anger is fear and pain. Keep that in mind. Some people just act out like that out of frustration. Don't take your work home with you. You ll be ok.
Sending you love and good vibes. You are doing such hard but great work. 🧡",2022-04-13 22:46:31,PutinIsaimbecile,u37a6r
Dementia,Navigating Medical Care,"Hi there!
I hope you all are doing well!  Recently, I was approached by a few people asking how to navigate medical care and hospital stay without frustration.  I am thinking of starting a project to teach everything I know about this, given my insider perspective as a physician who takes care of a lot of patients with dementia. Would you or someone you know be interested in learning this?

If so, please kindly reply YES so I know whether it’s worth spending time on.

Thank you much!

Leslie","Yes.  Wish I had this 2 years ago.  😪
YES. After my grandmother broke her hip and was discharged to post-surgery rehab, she was not given any pain medication for at least 48 hours despite bellowing in pain all day “because she didn’t ask us for it”
Yes. I am fumbling my way toward a nervous breakdown.
Yes, thank you. Although a big part of my frustration has been with Mangled Hell Care and the 5,473 government forms (federal, state, county, city) and ""mother-may-I?"" foolishness. I know you guys get mad at them too, but anything you can do to help with that stuff would be greatly appreciated. 

Example: my PCP says to me ""you need an in-home health aid *now* to help with your dementia-dx partner."" I've been asking for help for her since Feb. 4th and am still no closer. Yes, I know private pay is an option. But we're having to private-pay for adult daycare, incontinence underwear, will need home upgrades & reshuffling, and I've just come off putting mom & dad in their graves.
Yes. This info would be invaluable. Thanks in advance.

Dementia,Easter basket for grandmother with dementia and diabetes,"My grandmother has both dementia and diabetes. She is late stage dementia. Hard for her to understand what we are saying as we say it. None of her sentences make any since. She is very childlike at this point. She likes candy and dying eggs so we are going to dye eggs. 

What could I put for a gift basket thing for easter? Ofc it would have candy (not sugar free since it upsets her stomach) what other stuff could I put in a basket for her?","Stuffed toy easter bunny. Bubbles—the kind you dip, blow into the wand, bubbles come out. (If she can't, you can make bubbles for her.) Wind-up toys. Small toy musical instruments—xylophone, chimes. Framed picture of the whole family, doing something silly.
And snacks she likes, nuts etc. maybe a soft throw. Socks jammies.
Cute fuzzy socks with grips on the bottom, nice-smelling hand cream? Sweets will be most popular as that’s the strongest flavor that she can taste
Plushies, uno, fake flowers dollar tree, a notepad.

Dementia,My relative escaped locked memory care floor,"She was able to get out via an alarmed door, which apparently didn’t sound, get past reception, out the front door and walked up a super busy street to a grocery store 1/2 mile away!  The street is almost a highway with. 3 lanes of traffic on each side.

I don’t know all of the details yet but clearly this is not acceptable.  My relative always wants to leave and has been a flight risk for a while, so it’s nothing new.  

My relative doesn’t even know the area surrounding their facility.  

I’m so angry that this could happen.  My family is paying a ton of money to keep them safe and this happens.  They could have been hurt or killed.

What would you do if it was your loved one?","If the facility is not following up with you about the incident and their prevention plan for future fights then you may need to have your concerns sent to a state oversight body. But I would definitely reach out to them to see if they are going to follow up with you. 

Something similar happened in a nearby area but it was an assisted living (not memory care) resident, who are free to come and go at any time, day or night. He wandered late at night and froze to death. 

The residence was very open about communications with the local media and basically there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it because the person was in assisted living and before the incident had never been a wanderer. It’s just sad and not an easy disease to manage.
I would consider hiring a consultant, or what I call an ‘apartment finder’, to help you find a facility better equipped for security. I’m working with a company that doesn’t charge me for this, they get a referral fee from the facility.
Wow, I would be flamed so hard if this happened on my floor most likely fired. I’m so sorry your loved one had that experience and what you are going through.

Edit: Always check the corners of the elevator everyone. Sometimes they love to hide in the corners and if that system goes down for some reason it can cause real issues. I never leave the elevator area  I came up in until I know it’s closed and completely clear.
My mom did something similar. Didn't quite make it out the second set of doors but rammed her wheelchair into the first ones for long enough the alarm shut off and the lock released because of some fire safety thing. We raised hell with them, they put an ankle monitor on her, she couldn't get close to the door after that without someone coming to get her.
I would.report them to whatever agency is supposed to regulate them.",2022-04-13 13:21:19,TheoloniusNun,u2vfux
Dementia,"Do you guys wish it was easier to video call with your parents, especially with ones in assisted-living facilities?","There seems to be a serious lack of accessible technologies for seniors, especially ones with tremors and vision problems, etc. Are there specific accessible technologies you guys use to video call with them?","Not in assisted facility but we use an Alexa Show as the drop-in functionality means my husband doesn't need to know how to answer, it just answers automatically.
I installed a Facebook portal for my grandparents and they love it. My grandmother is fine picking up the phone and sometimes even calling us, my grandfather has advanced dementia and he can't use the device on his own but he loves chatting to people through it.
Another thing is that they aren’t digital natives. Even genx grew up around computer tech. But boomers and silent gen not so much.
Yes, we even set up splashtop for their laptop but the biggest hurdle was getting an aide who knew the wifi password and could sit there for a minute to try and figure it out before being called elsewhere
The only way I can do this is if a nurse or a visitor helps (I live across the country). Anyhow, my mum is mystified by video calling (we only really get to see up her nose) and gets quickly bored.
I'm not sure how helpful this would be but there might be some things out there for people with tremors to use video calls. If you need specific things for that, you can try looking in disabled spaces and asking the people there how they use aids for their disability. There's also probably a lot out there for those with residual vision in how they also use technology.

I know a lot of devices nowadays have the ability to receive voice commands. Might need another pair of hands to turn it on first and then in theory would be able to do everything hands free afterwards, so long as someone has a voice.
I have an Alexa Echo show, I can drop in on my father and talk to him any time.

He can just say Alexa call (my name) and it will call me for him.
Fortunately, dad's facility allows you to schedule FaceTime calls with support to their iPad, so that part is easy, but getting on the schedule depends on their staffing levels. Fortunately, dad is still able to use a flip phone for now, which is great because I live half the country away.
It really does seam like an open marketplace. We have an Alexa device, it works alright for dropping in but my mom will push buttons randomly and sometimes turn the volume way down or turn off the video.
I've been looking at the Viewclix for this, which is designed with seniors in mind. Please add any reviews if anyone has experience with this device. Unfortunately, my mom's ALF has really poor wifi (which is very annoying) so I have to get that sorted first


Viewclix calls can be answered with a remote or automatically. Calls are made via the app to a tablet-like device that can be wall mounted or propped up. You can also add photos to rotate through when calls aren't being made and it has a post-it note function for reminders.

Dementia,sink lock(?) or equivalent,"So I live with a couple people one of them were pretty sure has dementia but not properly diagnosed the other one he is just a complete fucking idiot   


Both of them try to 'help' by doing the dishes which doesnt help at all and mostly causes more issues   


One of them literally cannot see what he is doing with the dishes nor has the physical strength to scrub the shit off the dishes so basically anything he 'washes' goes straight back in the sink   


The other one decides that running the hot water and filling the sink for very literally two bowls and a couple cups is a worthwhile use of time water and heating which is wasteful at the best of times but especially you know current global situation price of heating and all that especially when half the time he fills the sink with hot water and just walks off to let the water go cold   


Both of them tend to drop things and just generally clumsy which yea dont really want broken glass all over the kitchen especially considering they dont say anything when they drop something   


Ive tried saying do not do the dishes I will do them but neither listen ive tried being nice ive tried being firm but nothing changes   


So is there some kind of lock I can use to prevent the hot water from being turned on   


Unfortunately we have a combination tap so its not like i could just disconnect one like I could do in the bathroom   


Preferably any solution would just affect the hot water side not the cold water because I dont exactly want to be getting woken up at 4am because they want a glass of water   


So is there any product designed to slip over the knob and lock it because the only things i could find are for outside hosepipe outlets not sink taps or is there some way i could just jerryrig it","[deleted]
Not sure on the water part but I've experience with the other issues. You might have to switch out the glass and such for plastic or something easier to hold. My mom used to drop a glass once every so often and with her Alzheimer's, that was definitely not safe. We went with switching to lighter weight glasses and reusable plastic cups. She hasn't dropped any in a year.

My sister and I also had to stay on top of the dishes ourselves to prevent mom from ""doing"" the dishes. We made sure to schedule time in the evenings and mornings to get them done before mom felt she needed to. Another thing that helped us was to set a timer for a reminder to do the dishes. Also when we were in an apartment with a forgetful friend, we taped reminders on the counter and sink rim which help cue him to not be as messy.

Oh, depending on how the faucet handle is, maybe a door knob cover for young children might work especially if they are not very good with using their hands. If you have a landlord or a director you could talk to, they might be able to switch out the style of sink for something that'll work better.

Sorry it's kinda a long reply...
You might have some luck with childproofing products, depending on the shape of your taps. Amazon and Walmart both have an array of them-maybe you will find something there. Good luck-I know how frustrating this disease can be.",2022-04-13 10:42:06,CONE-MacFlounder,u2rvl4
Dementia,Central heating controls,"My dad likes to mess with any electronic device he can get his hands on (TV remote, landline, etc). We can usually mitigate the problem by unplugging/removing the batteries. E.g. we have a spare remote with no batteries and he is content with that. Now he keeps changing the settings on the central heating. I ask him if he's feeling cold but he says no. 

 The control unit is mounted on the wall, which he can easily reach. This morning I found it set to 32C (90F). There's no easy way to stop him getting at the controls.  Any ideas on what to do?","Hang a photo over it or something similar like a tapestry and in the general area put up a fake thermostat
Ask your local hvac company if they can install one of those secure thermostats like some offices have, so only authorized people can change the temperature.
Hotels and restaurants have a locked plastic enclosure for thermostats.  Perhaps one of those would work.
Ran into this issue with my grandmother.  If she’s cold, all the way up.  If she’s hot, all the way down.  Add to it that she seems to have lost the ability to judge temperature.  32c/90f in the house but she sees snow outside?  She’ll put on a sweater, wrap herself in blankets, and complain about furnace being broken because she’s cold.

What my family did was go with a smart Thermostat, Nest specifically but I imagine others can do this.  Honeybee is another popular brand.

It has built in locking into its software.  You can override the lock with a pin code if you need to, but being a smart thermostat you can control it with either the Google Home app or the Nest App.

You can also share access to your (his) home in said app.  This means if your dad lives with someone you can share it with them.  If by “we” you mean siblings and not a spouse, it means you can share it with them.
Couple of different options: 

Buy a lockable cover for the control panel, these are easy to find on amazon. 

Get a heating engineer to disconnect your current control panel and install a new one in a cupboard/your room/somewhere you can hide it.
Great suggestions! Thanks all
Been there!  My grandfather would wake up in the morning, go to the thermostat and punch buttons until something came on.  I woke one morning in August in Georgia and found he had turned on the heat and set it for 90°.  I ended up getting a new thermostat that you had to flip up the plastic door to access the controls.",2022-04-13 06:34:30,FinalBlackberry5,u2nb7j
Dementia,Has your loved one ever accidentally stolen something?,"My grandmother is starting to experience some early signs, but nothing preventing her from living independently. Her car is broken and in the shop. I work from home and my car is the same model as hers, just a few years older, so she asked to borrow mine to do some errands. No problem, she’s never had any issues with driving before.

While she was at the drug store, she put my keys down on the counter. Someone else must have put theirs next to mine, and when she went to pick up my keys, she thought both sets were mine and the keyring had somehow come undone. She took both sets, left, put them together so they were all together, and gave them back to me once I got off of work. When I realized what had happened, it was already closed for the day. So I am going to call first thing in the morning to ask if anyone reported a missing pair of keys. I also recruited my mother to post on Facebook about them. 

Have anyone else’s relatives done this while early on? I’m hoping whoever got their keys swiped is understanding.","Unfortunately yes my uncle who is now deep into his vascular dementia has stolen before. We were in the drug store waiting for his prescription to be filled so we browsed around the store. Once we got his prescription and got in the car heading home, a little bit down the road he pulls out a Hershey candy bar he 5 finger discounted from the store. I don't know how the heck he did that without my knowledge but since then I watch him wherever we go a lot more closely. I went back to the store and explained what happened,luckily the cashier was understanding and sympathetic about what happened. I was very nervous about the whole thing. It happens and our loved ones don't know any better.",2022-04-13 00:08:14,shy-butterfly-218,u2hq7n
Dementia,I miss him so much.,"i guess i don't really have a point with this post but i just had like a semi-normal conversation with my dad. he wasn't having any hallucinations, and he tried his best to listen to what i said, and we laughed at a stupid joke i made. then he went to the bathroom and came back out and that part of him was gone again. we didn't spend a lot of time together when i was younger, he was always at work trying to provide for me and my mom so i rarely saw him. i don't know where i'm going with this, i just wish we had more time together back then. hugs to all of you, dementia really sucks :(","I’m really struggling with similar right now. I miss my mom more than I can ever explain. I miss the hugs she used to give, I miss the way she said my name, I miss the special way she used to tell me she loved me. She can’t have any sort of an intelligible conversation and constantly hallucinates. I hate it so much.
I feel you.

My grandma raised me, and it’s been hard. I often think about what it would be like if this didn’t happen. shes only 76, which i know is not /young/ per say but I work with elderly who are much older than her and still functioning you know? 

Or i think ab if I could teleport back in time. I have a lot of trouble recalling what she was like before but I’m not sure why- unless I think about teleporting back. (I feel my brain is protecting me from the feelings atm) 

There are some days, far and few between now, where she’ll recognize me suddenly and her face lights up and sometimes she’ll start crying happily. She reaches out to me and wants to hug and kiss me and tell me she loves me and it’s the closest i’ll get to the real her. It’s so bittersweet. A feeling that is so specific to those of us who are going through it.
Man, this brings a lot back. I was in a similar boat. Dad who worked a lot, pretty quiet, we didn't talk a lot when I was a kid, then I moved out. I saw him a few times a year, but not really regularly until a couple years before dementia started sneaking in. We did get to talk once in a while, though, and when we did he was always the best listener and sounding board. That died long before he did. Sucked so hard to have him there but also so far away, so that any possibility of getting closer was erased.
❤️
Big hug to you, it is so tough when the lucid moments come as they tend to leave just as quick. Try to enjoy those moments whenever they come if you can, it's hard with all the other turmoil I'm sure. Lots of love to you and yours",2022-04-12 21:40:50,mochirepresentative,u2ey4u
Dementia,Not being ready for this. Dad has dementia.,"MY 75 year old father has dementia. Not sure what type, but the whole family is having a reunion next month and I've been designated the ""responsible adult"" to take care of him. It's a 6 hour car ride to the ""vacation"" spot and I will be expected to look after him the entire time. Keeping track of keys/wallet/other stuff.  

I'm not ready for my dad to have this. Like January he was perfectly fine, and now....WTF do I do? He thinks my sister is me, thinks that his sister is due soon to pick him u0p for the reunion.  If he calls me by my sister or stepmom's names, do I correct him or what?  I'm so...unprepared.","It’s really hard, I know. I recommend watching some of Teepa Snow’s videos for caregivers/families on making things easier for themselves and the person they are caring for. Disagreeing, correcting, or arguing with someone with dementia tends to make them feel ashamed, agitated, or afraid. Imagine someone telling you that the reality you are experiencing isn’t real. You would freak out, too. The best advice I’ve heard is to play along, change the subject, or ask them neutral questions about the person/situation they are confusing in order to understand where they are stuck (“tell me about a time you and your sister did x”—those memories tend to stick around longer and can be amusing/fun for him to think about). You’ve got this.
I would also just know that traveling and changing routines can be really hard on someone with dementia. It can really bring out confusion and fatigue. So I would keep your dad to any routines as much as possible and designate a space he can be in that is quiet and peaceful when he needs it.
Honestly as hard as it is, try and make the best of it. Take advantage of the time and if you find some lucid moments ask him about his life, his childhood, ask about memories he might still hold. Make a video or audio recording, take lots if pictures and be sure to try and laugh together. Trust me, you will cherish these memories in the years to come. My dad is too far gone to do things like that now 😒 and I'd give anything to be able to make more memories with him.
This sucks. I'm so sorry you are going through this.

But I can offer one suggestion to help out: Dad's always right. Just agree with him, or keep him talking about whatever he thinks is going to happen.

Your Dad's brain is not functioning properly, and it will only get worse over time. There is no cure for dementia, although how fast a person degrades varies greatly. It could be a couple of months or a decade... there's no way to know.

So the world your Dad is experiencing is only RIGHT NOW. There's no tomorrow. There's no yesterday. There is only the present moment for him.

And you have the ability to make this moment right now as good as possible and give him a moment of joy and happiness. If he is excited to be talking to your sister - but he's actually talking to you - go ahead and play along. Be your sister for a minute. Ask him a leading question that gets him talking. Anything at all...

Because the honest truth is that he won't remember later, and his brain will move on other thoughts throughout the day.

All you can do is make each moment you are with him as easy and comfortable as possible, and to do that, just try to agree with him and move the idea along. Pushing back is pointless... he won't remember he was wrong or confused, and - in the moment - he won't respond well to the pushback.

Finally, find a dementia sufferers support group. I'm in one that meets via Zoom once every two weeks. We all just talk with each other about our experiences and our loved ones, and share techniques and ideas for how to deal with the dementia journey. It is incredibly important and valuable to talk about your experiences with others. You gotta refill your compassion well constantly, and a support group will help.
Hey y'all, thanks for the support and advice.  Another worry I have that just popped up.  My cousin's wife shares a first name with my dead mother.  They were divorced for like 35 years at the time she passed, but I'm really uncomfortable thinking about it now.
Who decided that you're the one responsible for keeping track of him the entire time? Can the family all pitch in to hire an aide to manage him for the weekend so you can actually talk to people? Just driving with him alone will be exhausting",2022-04-12 20:32:03,serenepoet1,u2dltw
Dementia,Dad with dementia can’t/won’t care for himself at home but miraculously recovers when doctors are watching.,"I am so frustrated. 

My dad (62M) has vascular dementia and is cared for solely by my mom (61F) in their home. They can’t afford in-home help (which their insurance barely pays for) or assisted living (which it won’t cover at all). Although he is incontinent, can’t take his meds on his own, falls regularly, and can’t independently shower or use the bathroom, he is deemed too independent for nursing-home-care coverage by their insurance or Medicaid. 

He is currently in the hospital for sepsis, acute kidney injury, pancreatitis, and an infected pressure sore. My mom has taken diligent care for him for almost a decade, but his condition has deteriorated, and it’s just too much for her now. We were both hoping this hospital stay would lead to rehab and eventual admission to a nursing home. 

But my dad is showtiming and seems to have the ever-rotating cast of providers fooled. They even judged his ability to transfer from his wheelchair (he’s an amputee) to the toilet an 11 out of 13. But when he’s at home, he almost always falls doing that maneuver alone. 

In the hospital, he’s claiming to have no nausea, no pain. But he’s done nothing but complain about nausea and abdominal pain for a week. And his test results support that. 

They’re going to end up sending him home with her, aren’t they? She’s going to kill herself caring for him. I mean, he outweighs her by 50 pounds. This is madness. 

This has happened before. In the hospital and rehab? “I want to walk again! I want to wear my prosthesis!” Real life: I have literally never seen the man wear his prosthesis. Ever.","Every time he falls on the ground at home, call the fire department to pick him back up again. It will be annoying as heck but it will establish a record to pack up your claim that HE IS NOT SAFE LIVING AT HOME.
You are right. This is exactly what will happen.

I suggest seeing if you can get hospice on board. They can send someone out daily to help bathe him and change him and help your mom out too. I know they need much more help than that, but it's better than nothing.
No advice but just wanted to share that I relate. My dad has vascular dementia and is in an aged care home. He’s been on the phone with me, crying, saying he wants to kill himself, ranting about how mean we all are and then a carer walks in and he’s all, ‘Hi sweetheart, how are you?’ and cracking jokes and telling them how good he is. As soon as they leave, he’s back on the emotional rollercoaster. 
Also, it took several falls before he went into the home. Had to call the ambulance every time as he’s on blood thinners and any fall can cause internal bleeding. My mum still runs after him and I worry it’ll kill her long before his dementia takes him.
Ego and pride are usually the last things to be broken down- in a good way or the bad way.

My grandma is clearly declined, however when a new person is at the house she will be her absolute best self. Trying to engage in conversation, listening, laughing. When she can talk, she will talk about her kids, her husband or me just endlessly gassing us up. When it’s just us, the swearing and “i hate you, i hope you die” ect comes out. 

I second calling when he falls, something to keep a record since it’s dangerous for him. If you’re there while doctors ect are present, tell them that he still has ego and pride. If they’re good, they’ll understand what this means.
It's super frustrating.  My mom was able to hold it together for show, too.  Then one night she ended up in the ER because the residents of her apartment complex found her wandering the halls all night long.  She insisted to the staff at the ER that I was there with her (it was against the rules because of COVID - I couldn't even be in the waiting room), and she had to get out to go to work in the morning (she was retired for 3 years at that point).  There were 2 ER visits before that where she had everyone fooled.  All 3 visits were in a 2-week period, so I think we just caught her at the ""right"" time.  Maybe keep calling 911 every time he falls and maybe you'll be able to catch him when the mask slips.  I'm so sorry - I wish I had better advice.  \*\*HUGS\*\*
So my mom is 67. She was in the hospital for exactly 3 weeks today and today they transferred her to a skilled nursing home facility. She only had Medicare. The first day she got admitted to the hospital (for very low blood sugar level) I enrolled her in Medicaid and we got approved for it. I spoke to the hospital’s case  manager and social worker and explained everything to them about us not being able to properly care for her at home. We were getting burnt out. The problem was she would definitely refuse going into a nursing home. So they suggested I get guardianship to make those choices for her. They made some calls and got me paperwork to fill out to petition to become her guardian. They also said they were getting the doctors to testify and do their part. My court date is next month. But after Medicaid approved her and we got the ball rolling for me to become guardian and a bed opened at a NH, she was able to get transferred there today for long term care. I’m not sure if this info will help you and every situation is different but please tell the nurses that you need to talk to the case worker or social workers at the hospital!
When she is at home and not able to do something I record it on my phone. When we have her appointments and she pulls the I'm fine card, I show the recordings to her doctor (away from her seeing). This has helped immensely. I actually started this years ago with our older dog so I could show the vet what we were seeing. Never thought I would be doing the same thing with my mother.",2022-04-12 15:52:41,LowOvergrowth,u27sl5
Dementia,How to get your loved one to shower,"The title says it all. My mom, 81, and I am her son and primary care giver. We do have a part time caregiver that helps and showers her on the days she comes by (twice weekly) but on the days she cannot her has other commitments, I have one hell of a time getting her to shower. Any ideas?","Does she really need the showers on these other days? if not, you might be causing her more distress, and yourself more stress, than is worth it.   


I feel like we just have to accept some of their refusals.
I would observe your twice weekly aide (from a distance) and see how she manages to do it. Even ask her for advice directly
What worked for my dad:

A bath poncho made out of a sheet or towel.  We'd slip it over his head while his clothes were still on and then undressed him.  This stopped him from feeling cold/vulnerable.

Get the bathroom screaming hot and steamy, like steam room level stuff.

Have music playing.  Weirdly, Jimmy Buffet for my dad.  (Even though he never listened to him any other times)  

A shower seat and handheld shower so the water didn't come down from above.
Showers and baths are pretty vulnerable times.  You're naked, you may be afraid of slipping and falling, you might find it painful to get to those hard-to-reach places.  And getting help bathing can be humiliating.  So bathing can been a little intimidating and not a pleasure as we might think.

My mom uses the excuse that she worries about the lack of much of a lip on the shower (purposeful to eliminate trip and fall hazards) and getting the bathroom floor wet.  We've explained over and over that the floor is linoleum and won't be harmed by water.  She still uses it as an excuse not to shower.  

We've decided we won't push it unless she's actually reeking.  If it's just a few days without a shower, it's not worth getting her upset to push the issue.

Getting her in clean clothes is battle enough.
My dad refused to shower for months. We hired a shower aide but he still refused. It was one of a number of reasons why we took the gut wrenching step of moving him into memory care. To our shock, they managed to get him to shower the first day. However, it’s been 2 weeks and they haven’t been able to get him to shower again. 😖
You can look into getting extra large bathing wipes for this purpose. No-rinse shampoo and spray in, brush out dry shampoos are also available for home care use.
We do showers once a week, and light bed baths a few times a week with a wash cloth.
My grandfather got that way.  He would claim he bathed when he had not, and he was starting to smell.  Thank goodness his doctor recommended home health care.  They came twice a week to help him shower, and I could get the clothes he had been wearing for several days in the washing machine.  When he would say he had already showered, I’d tell him I wanted him looking nice so we could go out for lunch.  He would say “Oh, ok!” and wouldn’t argue anymore.  Then I would keep my word, and take him to lunch.  If that didn’t work, I would call my great aunt and ask if we could come over.  I’d tell him that Aunt Dolores called and asked if we wanted to come over, and that worked too.
We used to try for twice a week, but it's hard. Now we usually do once a week unless there's am appointment. I haven't noticed any odors, but it's rare she does much these days. My aunts say older people don't need to shower as often as their skin will break down. One, a nurse, has suggested bed baths instead of a shower, but so far the shower is still working weekly for us.

What works for us, is when she's already in the bathroom to use the toilet, we move her into the shower. When we tried to ask her to get a shower, she would tell us she already had one or she would take one later. Already being in the bathroom was a big help and and she's half undressed usually. After she's done using the toilet, we move her to the shower chair, then move that into the shower enclosure. I, or someone, now have to sit in on the shower bench with her. I either direct her to wash herself, or have to physically do it while she holds a wash cloth over her eyes.
Thank you all for the comments. Skipped the shower and just reheated left overs and she was happy as a clam watching soccer (her team real
Madrid was playing) so just let it be. The wipes are a fantastic idea along with the dry shampoo and will go down the route.
I am a caregiver in home Healthcare. I drape a towel over their shoulders and put one in their lap to help keep them warm and covered. I also change the phrasing. If bathroom, clean up, or other phrases trigger extreme no's then refer to it as a spa/sauna.

 If she is capable then let her clean her face and hands, it will make her feel more in control and less like a child. When cleaning the areas covered by the towel, just lift the towel up and go underneath it. Then wet the covering and use it to rinse the area (if you don't have a handheld shower head). 

Once you're ready to dry her off, replace the two wet covering towels with new ones and use them to dry her. I always tell the client thank you for letting me help you after the shower is over, and if they got upset during it then I apologize while recognizing how hard what theyre going through is. I hope some of this is helpful!

I know this takes a lot of towels but sometimes using a few more towels can be the difference between someone being clean and having a skin issue or smelling. It's worth it imo
My husband only showers once a week now. I have to tell him to soap himself up and to rinse his hair. I just don’t worry about it. I can hardly get him to change his boxer shorts. He used to shower every day, even just a short year ago. 

He goes to a day center and I’ve had pneumonia. I realized on Sunday that he hadn’t shaved all week bc I usually shave him. Took me forever with a safety razor and an electric razor. I have to help him brush his teeth too. 

I highly recommend a bidet toilet seat. My husband doesn’t know how to use it but I can turn it on for him. Oh, yeah, he doesn’t flush the toilet anymore either.
My mom refuses to shower as well. Wears the same shirt over and over. She almost slapped the CNA that tried to help her get a sponge bath. It’s a nightmare!
I don't know how many people this applies to, but with my mom, she hated taking showers because she hated water touching her ears. Even in memory care, she refused showers. I finally got her to talk to me about why and I got her some silicone ear covers. The staff said it was like night and day. There were no other issues with showers after that.
You can buy no-rinse soaps and wipes that your mom can use to clean. You can buy special deodorant for all body areas like by lume.
My mom is 94.  She does not complain as much as she used to about baths.  She was shy at first, but not so much anymore.  Things changed once I started helping her bathe.  I'll tell her it's bath day and she'll usually say okay.  Before, her excuses were she was either hungry or she was full, or she was cold.  I think that it was too difficult for her to bathe herself, raising her arms to shampoo her hair, and other parts of her body.  So now, she sits in the bath seat and I'll wash her while she holds the shower wand or the washcloth.  I make sure the water is at the temperature she's comfortable with.  The funny part is that I can't get her to take a bath before 1:00 or after 3:00 p.m., so I have my two-hour window to get her to bathe.
I do good to get my dad in q day a week. He says he doesnt do anything so he is not dirty
Unsure if this will help your mom but my mom and I hired a part time caregiver that recommended that we pretend that there's construction scheduled on the water pipes on the day we want my dad to shower, and that they'll turn off the water for the entire day (or two days or whatever you want to say) and that we all have to shower before, say, 12pm, when the construction is going to start! 

If my dad doesn't believe us usually my mom or I will shower first and then he goes in haha
thanks for starting this topic.   My mother, age 76, has been like this for about a year now.  I tell her she needs to shower and she says she already did.  I live here and know she did not.  

I do not really push it, but try my best to get her to shower every few days.  With Covid I figure she is not hurting anyone as she rarely goes in anywhere and is really not visiting with many people these days outside of her brother.
I feel this frustration and struggle with this too. My loved one will no longer take showers but 2 times a week I fill the sink in the bathroom up with warm water and baby wipes to clean him if he'll let me. I makes sure the room is warm and give him a bathrobe to keep on as I clean him quickly as I can. Again it comes down to him allowing me. Sometimes I have success in showing him his clean clothes that would look good on him,you know a lot of buttering up and putting the idea that getting clean is something he wants to do. There's only so much you can do and I wish you best of luck.
Does she have a shower chair or other mobility aids?
My dad loves to go out and eat, so we just tell him we're taking him to breakfast/lunch/dinner so he needs to hop in the shower. He always does it willingly. Before we hit on this ""reward,"" it was a huge struggle.
Dry shampoo for the hair. You just spray it on and brush it out, baby wipes for pits and privates. It's how I get through some days to not fight with my mom or distress her. It's not perfect but it's better than nothing.
I suggest the book “Bathing Without A Battle” it’s a great book.
I tell my 89-year-old MIL that her grandson (my son- 22 years old) is coming by for a visit. For whatever reason, she wants to look nice for him. Hey.....whatever works!
I’ve read that the elderly don’t really need bathing as frequently as we might think. Once a week can be sufficient, and it has something to do with their skin being thinner. Of course, certain circumstances require a bath. Grandma used to play with her food and try to hide it in her undergarments or rub it in her hair. Oh god, I just remembered a spaghetti incident.

Dementia,Yesterday was Mom's birthday,"She turned 82, and she had no idea it was her birthday or how old she is. She kept forgetting, and every time we gave her a card or she received a phone call with birthday wishes, we had to remind her that it was her special day. 

I hate that I dreaded it.  I'm so tired, depressed, and, anxious that I put in minimum effort.  A card, a small cake, a couple of sets of PJ's.  I hate that I was cranky with her when she insisted on spending every single minute with me - it's getting to the point where I have to hide in the bathroom AND SHE WILL STILL KNOCK ON THE DOOR while I'm in there.  I need so much space from her and it felt shitty wanting it on her birthday.

The thing is, I'm pretty sure that this will either be her last birthday ever or, the last one that she will be even able to talk and understand anything said to her.  Her decline is happening so quickly now I'm absolutely certain next year she'll be in skilled nursing because I can't do this much longer and I won't have the skillset needed to care for her.

Sorry for the word vomit, I know I'm all over the place, I just need to get it OUT.  I hate my life right now, and I feel terrible complaining because it's so much worse for her, and all I can think about is how I wish I could have my life and sanity back.  

Thanks for listening.  I needed to vent.  I'm glad I have therapy today.","Everyone needs to vent. And everyone needs a break. I completely understand. Sending hugs. ❤
Your feelings are valid. Holidays are so hard sometimes
My wife and I are are dealing with very similar issues with her Dad. It sucks. Dementia sucks and right now everyones  lives  suck. Hang in there, I think anyone who has to deal with this has had similar or worse issues to deal with. Watching someone go in reverse is brutal. Good luck!
You did your best.  And minimal effort is a good thing at this point- presents aren't remembered and often too much at a time is sensory overload.   I'm doing a minimal amount for my mom at Easter- a small chocolate rabbit and a card.  She loves candy but if she opens it, she forgets she opened it and then five minutes later tells me ""that's been sitting out FOR MONTHS"" so no point in buying too much.

Please, vent away.  Dementia is the absolute worst and it is so draining.   Hugs to you- I know you are are doing a lot and it's thankless work.
I find those celebratory days hard, too. You did a good job.  And yay for therapy.  I believe it is essential because this disease is so hard.",2022-04-12 12:00:42,PowertothePixie,u22h7r
Dementia,Is it time for skilled nursing?,"My dad is having a rough go of it lately. Just having these bouts of aggression and attacking people. Apparently he is looking for his mom who died many years ago. He’s hitting staff and patients. We keep adjusting his 
 meds but nothing changes. Last night he was admitted to the hospital and he smacked me and my bf a couple times, although not hard. The doctor there suggested that his dementia has progressed to the point that he needs skilled nursing. But the Alf is trying to argue that he just needs more med adjustment and he will fine even though he is upsetting all their residents. 

I’m just lost and the only one making this decision. It also doesn’t help that I’m in a massive fibromyalgia flare and it’s hard to function, much less be a person right now.","Yes, he definitely needs a level up in care to keep him and others safe. Remember, it’s normal and he’s not the first one to run a muck like this. I love patients like your Dad because there’s so much that can be done to work through his combative behaviour. Love and patience is the key, as well as routine…meds are awesome too obviously but when put themselves in his shoes and figure what’s causing his anxiety (this is the cause of aggression basically always) then he’ll find some relief.

He misses his mum, so of course he feels like shit, do what you can to bring him maternal comfort ie soft blankets and toys, calming and familiar sounds and smells, and again…no surprises because he’ll benefit from routine. If he wants to eat chocolate mouse for breakfast - let him. 

Pain symptoms will definitely set off his temper so a pain treatment plan needs to be established. Pain is scary when you’re in a confused state like he is. 

Psychiatric meds work too, but hopefully he’s got a doctor that knows what they’re doing. 

I can’t stress how much his aggression is most likely caused by fear, anxiety and or pain. Being angry feels a lot better than feeling anxious hence why we switch into battle mode. 

You’ve got this!! X

Skilled nursing can be prohibitively expensive so I wonder if assisted living is trying to save you from that. But a short 2-4 weeks stint might be enough to get him settled into a new medication routine. Is he in assisted living or memory care currently?

The other option is finding a memory care facility that specializes in caring for dementia patients if his current facility doesn't offer these services.

I'm sorry you're going through this. There is no easy decision when they become violent like this. Safety is the first priority, and you should do what you feel will create the safest environment for you him and his caregivers.
This is always a difficult decision. The main benefits of skilled nursing versus assisted living if they have it at minimum license practical nurses sometimes referred to as licensure occasional nurses or LPN/LVN and typically have a minimum of one registered nurse on duty. Personal care homes in assisted living facilities typically only have med techs and potentially an LPN. I was a med tech during nursing school and you literally get anywhere from one day to no more than two weeks of training. Very minimal. So unless there is a third-party like hospice involved providing for medication recommendations it’s very difficult for a personal care home or assisted-living to determine to what level of medication is effective or not. At least at a skilled nursing facility, if and I do repeat if the staff of skilled on reassessing the effective medication‘s after being given versus just being so understaffed that they feel overwhelmed just getting out the med pass…, They can adjust the meds more accurately.
I hope your Dad is seeing geriatric psychiatrist who works with these patients daily. Which medications is he on? Respiradone and seroquel are often used. If the aggression continues and all physical reasons, such as UTI and pain have been ruled out, then a stay at the hospital may be needed. They will assess him and figure out where he will need to be placed. He may need to be put on a 30 day formal psychiatric hold.",2022-04-12 11:47:03,Adverbage,u225yc
Dementia,Dementia Caregivers in Florida - support group soon,"I found an online group program with a therapist that takes Medicare and PPOs that's just for caregivers.

Dementia,"Demented family member refuses medication and is very agressive. Please, help!","Hello, it’s my first time here and this will be quite a read. But I ask you kindly to help. We are at a loss. 

I will start with all the basic information. 
We have a family member who suffers from dementia, she’s 88 years old, lives on her own, and in poor health. Mentally, atleast. We live in a big house, in a flat above hers but we do not get along at all. She was always rude and obnoxious even when not demented, but now it has only gotten worse. We are her only family left, she is the grandma of my mom. So in this house there is my mom, dad, me, my little brother and our great grandma (the demented lady). 
She refuses any kind of medication, we’re constantly at the doctors begging to do something because we can’t control her (it’s illegal). She goes out on her own, is in constant dispute with neighbours, calling the police 5x a day, getting into fights, getting lost, she is rude to us, screams at us, threatening us to leave her house. She’s very, very ill. And yet there is nothing we can do. 

I am a nurse, I started noticing the symptoms a long time ago, and notifyed her doctor. But there is nothing we or they could do. They gave her medications, had the talk with her, so did I and my mom. We tried to get her to a psychologist, but she refuses to go anywhere, getting worse each day. She talks with herself most nights, we can’t sleep. 

So now I am turning to you, reddit, I don’t know how to give her medication so she won’t notice because if she won’t take them, she will most likely go insane. She doesn’t want to talk to us and won’t listen. I don’t know what to do anymore. We also don’t share a kitchen so we can’t put it in her food. What else is there left to do? Where do I go and who do I turn to? Our medical system doesn’t allow us to forcefully take her anywhere, so there is nothing much we can do. 

Thank you for your time.","If the tablets can be crushed (ie not slow release) then they can be mixed in with food. Refusing meds is common and nurses commonly mix meds with Jam, Nutella, custard ect.
Maybe putting her in a home would be best. For the sanity of everyone. Talk to your locally department of social services. If you can't afford care, the county will step in.
Does your country have adult protective services?
If she is phoning the police that much they will have a general idea something is wrong. I'm not sure where you are. Parts of our police force deal with the elderly because these things have happened before. There might be enough of a record of these phone calls to provide to her Dr to say, ""hey, I need help!""  I'm not sure if you have a POA set up. If you do, you will then be able to make decisions for the benefit of your great grandmother. I would be wary of dosing someone, most legal authorities frown upon that. The drugs that would probably help would most likely be available by prescription only.
Find out what is necessary to establish control of her finances and medical treatment.

If you can avoid being fined by calling the police on your relative, then you call the police. In addition to that, Call when she gets lost. Call when she screams and threatens. Call about fights.

Call an ambulance when she is out of control. Screaming? That's a psych issue.

You need to get to a point legally where you have control of her medical visits and finances, and you can get there by repeated raising the alarm. At some point you will get a doctor who can give you a letter that allows you to assume control medically. You need to know what the mechanism is so you can make that your goal.

Good luck!
Does she forget to take meds, or does she refuse to take them?  Ask about getting a compounding pharmacy to make gummy versions for her. She might be more willing to take them if it's presented to her as something she would enjoy.

Other than that -- I just want to thank you for referring to her as the ""demented family member.""  I refer to my mother-in-law as being demented, or, on really rough days, as the Dementor (on those days, blessedly few, she can suck all the happiness and joy out of a person).
Come over every night with desert.  

&#x200B;

Someone posted once how dementia patents LOVE milk shakes (can confirm), you can put it in that.  My grandma does hot cocoa every night with fiber in it, but other meds can easily go in it (add a bit of espresso powder and salt to cover the taste).  From what I've gathered pudding is a good one.  Anything that is a favorite.  I can see baklava being done with ease (homemade, pre honey soak).  Most of the meds have instructions for adding to food, if not ask for capsules so that you can open it to add it to food.  [Here's a vid on opening capsules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEEUzwXF41s).

&#x200B;

People with dementia also do really well with routine.  Keep coming over every night for dinner/desert, it might take a few weeks to get used to it but keep it up.

&#x200B;

Good luck!
Sneaking meds into someone's food is the shadiest thing ever and illegal. She doesn't want  help you can't force her until certain criteria is met and certain paperwork is filled out. If she's that bad, she needs to be admitted to the hospital voluntarily or involuntarily.",2022-04-12 10:29:13,PinxxDeath,u20ff3
Dementia,Do you have a relative with Dementia/Alzheimer's in India? Please help me!,"Dear community,

I am posting with a lot of hope here having exhausted all other sources. I am working on my thesis on dementia (Alzheimer’s, FTD, DLB, any type) in India. It’s been a tough journey finding and speaking with family-based caregivers (like spouses, children, or daughter-in-law/son-in-law) who look after relatives with dementia. There are over 5 million people suffering from dementia in India, yet the “log kya kahenge” syndrome that riddles our society only compounds the silent suffering of the caregiver. Today sucked even more because my faculty has written off my work stating that with my current sample size, they feel I am unable to back the conclusions I have derived. There are people going into depression owing to caregiving - the least we can do is build a safe space for them to share their problems. My study wishes to identify the roadmap for caregiver empathy. 

If you or someone in your network in India is going through dementia then please feel free to dm me or leave a comment below. You can also help by spreading the word around.

I’d be super grateful for your support!

Kind regards

P.S. Mod, I hope you'll permit this post.","Did you post this in r/India? Good luck, I'm sure there are many overwhelmed caregivers in India and I hope you find some of them.",2022-04-12 10:18:08,Financial_Race_6895,u206t7
Dementia,How often do you visit AL?,"My mom is in AL for a few weeks now. She has moderate dementia, with moments if lucidity but she’s not really self sufficient. The facility is good but sometimes when I come trash has built up, things aren’t in their place (she has a tendency to pull things from her closet and put them around her room), non trash things are in the trash, the tv remote is lost, etc… and I have to spend some time “resetting” everything to a good state. She hasn’t taken advantage of AL facility activities, just hangs in her room watching tv. She seems relatively content but the longer I stay away the more disoriented she seems to get and the more calls I get from her about things she can’t figure out that she forgets she can ask staff about (like tv, temperature).

I’ve been visiting daily but it doesn’t feel sustainable. That said, I’m not seeing how I could be away for too many days. Was hoping to learn more about how others approach these situations.","I visit 4 to 6 times a week. It’s getting a bit exhausting, so I might try to stick to 4. My advice to you would be to try if you can to have some sort of schedule. I generally arrive after dinner and stay approximately one hour. We sit in the same place and talk about the same things. The routine aspect of it helps I think. But then she might expect me on the days I don’t go (even if I told her the day before), because of that routine that is in place. In the end, I think that the important part is to find a balance. Something that works in your schedule and that is consistent enough to not disorient her.",2022-04-12 10:11:39,-emanresUesoohC-,u201pa
Dementia,"MiL always thinks it's dingy / ""going to rain""","My MiL was widowed 10 months ago, is undiagnosed (due to ""hating doctors"") but very clearly has some form of dementia (She repeats questions, asks where FiL is, etc etc). She's had it for at least 5 years. She lives alone (because that's what she wants and is safe to do so, with some adaptions), but we pick her up every day on the way home from work and she has tea with us.

Every day without fail she says ""it's going to rain"" or similar and will comment on it repeatedly, because she thinks its so dingy / overcast. even now, with brighter, longer days at 5pm, when its sunny. So it absolutely isn't overcast. it's like she's looking through sunglasses or something.

Conversely she thinks car headlights are stupidly bright, and that they must hurt us as much as they hurt her. So she is at both ends of the extreme. Lights are too bright, but every day is overcast (when it isn't).

Despite always being happy to be with us and to be picked up for tea, she then quickly gets anxious when not at home, and uses the ""bad weather"" as a reason to request to go home (""I don't want you driving in the oncoming storm"").

Is this something to do with the dementia? is her perception of light and dark effected?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Background / context

I know I am going to have to be 'bad cop' at some point soon and push / trick her in to getting medical attention i think. Just so we know whats going on. My FiL & husband never stood up to her about her refusal to seek any type of medical assistance. She used to be a very grumpy woman, so it was a lot easier to give up pushing than fight her on this stuff. The grumpiness has mellowed with onset as long as you don't upset her. My husband once tried to talk to her about her issues but she refuted everything and seemed genuinely distressed as to why he would make up such things.

She was primary carer for her mum who had diagnosed dementia, it sounds like her father had it too but he was gone before I became part of the family (25 years ago). Her twin sister has diagnosed dementia, and like i say, she clearly has it.  My father in law was hiding from us just how bad it was (Not sure why as we where/are very active in their lives) and until FiL death she put on more of a front for us (didn't always manage it, but managed enough to hide just how bad it was).",I would suggest getting her eyes checked.

Dementia,"After five years, sadness and relief","For five years, I and our children had been trying to get my wife to a doctor for her increasingly obvious cognitive problems. 

We’ll, as previously posted, the inevitable crisis happened and five days ago she (VERY unwillingly) entered a memory care facility. They do not want me to visit for about two weeks, and after two stressful phone calls, even those are out for the moment. 

Sadness and relief…these years could have been somewhat better (especially since it’s vascular dementia), but that’s not who she is/was and that’s now history. 

Hoping things will settle down and I can visit and even take her out for lunch, but clearly not yet. 

So thankful that we bought Long Term Care insurance around 15 years ago. I don’t know how the next years would be without it.","I'm glad you were able to place her. 

I really think people with dementia go through the stages of grief, conscious of it or not. My grandma went through something similar but at a faster rate. Luckily denial was the shorter phase and she sought diagnosis/treatment pretty early on. We are at year 9 of her diagnosis. Her anger lasted a year or 2. 

Hopefully with some time she can fall into a routine and find happiness.
OMG - I'm so sorry - your story sounds similar to my mom's.  It took about 8 months for her to finally settle in.  At that point, she was thinking that she was still living in her apartment.  She has now regressed to thinking my brother & I are small children.  I hesitate to go see her, because I don't want to confuse her - imagine thinking your daughter is about 10 years old, and a 50 year old woman shows up saying she's your daughter.  And my one biggest piece of advice that I've gotten from literally everyone from the facility staff, to her family doctor, to our neighbor who's mom had it - DON'T TAKE HER OUT.  She will only get more confused & just might refuse to go back.  I'm not sure how her facility works it, but at my mom's, if I wanted to have dinner with her, I just need to let them know and they will prep a dinner for me too for a small fee ( I think it's $10 or $15).
Oh my heart goes out to you- it’s a mixture of grief and relief when you place a loved one in memory care.  It was rough for my mom as well.  It’s a lovely well run place but she was using her landline to call 911, raging and trashing her room.  It had to be done, though, as you know all too well, sadly.

The anger is gone now, for the most part.  Short, more frequent visits seem to work the best.  I tried to take her out for lunch or to visit at my house but the experience was too overwhelming- the dementia makes car rides terrifying as she thinks cars are coming too close, we are going to be hit, etc.  So we just visit and I always have a small treat in hand to bring her- gifts brighten her day.

It should get better- but it’s dementia so things aren’t going to be amazing- but with time and a routine it will hopefully be more pleasant.  My mom enjoys the music and the scheduled programs.",2022-04-12 02:33:04,barryaz1,u1sit7
Dementia,Should my dad have to ask for pain medication? Nursing home not giving pain meds after hip fracture unless he explicitly asks.,"Last week my dad fell out of bed at his nursing home and badly broke his hip. He had surgery placing a rod, screws and a plate, was in the icu for a week and sent back to his nursing home. I saw him this weekend two days after he was discharged and he seemed really out of it. I assumed he was on lots of pain meds.  He told me he was in a lot of pain. He was just super sleepy and couldn’t stay awake, talked in a whisper. 

Today his palliative care nurse called and said he was doing so well and hasn’t asked for pain meds since he was discharged from the hospital last week. I told him about my visit and learned he had no pain meds that day at all. The nurse said they give them when the patient asks. 

I’m not sure my dad understands to ask for pain meds. For context he comes across very lucid at times. You almost question his dementia diagnosis until you realize he thinks he is working at the nursing home not a resident. Then he talks about how they are holding his hostage and refusing to pay him and he can’t find his car. And he thinks he’s owed a paycheck from a place he hasn’t worked for in 40 years. It’s strange. He has also forgotten he has a brother and sister. I’m not convinced he understands to ask for and can make a connection between pain meds and pain. Also worth noting the palliative care team got involved because he was very combative both physically and verbally prior to his hip fracture and refusing to take meds. They determined oral meds stress him so part of his care plan is to reduce unnecessary pills. Like cutting out his fish oil supplement and other vitamins. So the excuse was they don’t want to upset him by overwhelming him with pills unless he asks. 

Does this seem right?  Do I just not understand how this works?  I’ve never had a parent or any family member go through this so I may not understand.","Not a doctor/nurse but I work in an Assisted Living facility as the Activity Director. If the meds have been prescribed PRN or as needed, they won't give anything unless he asks. If you are his medical PoA, you can ask the doctor to change it to meds every X # of hours. The M.C. staff I've worked with have been attentive to our residents non verbal cues when it comes to pain and will bring it up to the nurse who then will try to get an answer from the resident (are you hurting?) in order to give PRN meds. You can ask to talk to the Director of Nursing at the facility to get a more detailed answer. Also, pain meds come in more forms than oral, some are creams, others are patches. 
Hope this helps.
Wow! Just wow! A dementia patient asking for his own meds? Ludicrous. I'm so sorry for you both to be going through such agony of body and mind 😪
Nursing home seems unfamilar with the way dementia-brain works. Or perhaps too passive and literalist in accepting without question the order for pain meds ""when asked for."" Dementia, at least for my partner, means knowing *something* is needed, but no clue what is needed, why, who supplies it, when… or possibly if ""what"" is known, then how to ask in words for it. Given that pills take at least 1/2 hour to work, and dementia attacks short-term memory, I think you're right to question dad's ability to connect ""pill"" with ""pain-goes-away.""
As a specialty visiting nurse visiting patients wherever they live including at facilities I find that PRN medication’s, those which need to be asked for, are not regularly given, regularly assessed in the correct way by the nursing staff and if you have somebody who has dementia like symptoms it’s not going to ask for them. So depending on the situation and family desires, I typically write A recommendation to give XYZ mad at X frequency as well as have a PRN dose for breakthrough.

Please consider talking with the doctor or nurse practitioner or a physicians assistant as to prescribing routine pain medication as well as having a PRN dose available for breakthrough pain.
We encountered exactly the same. Grandma had a hip replacement and we weren’t able to visit her in rehab at first because covid, she was kicking screaming that she was in pain etc then we realized she had been off pain meds cold turkey for several days because “she didn’t ask”!!!!  The surgeon to say “every x hours for y days AND as needed”.

oh i’m getting mad remembering that incident all over again.
It didn’t occur to me that the problem could be the way they were prescribed. I will talk to them about having them prescribed at regular intervals instead of prn. Not sure if it’s possible but I’ll try. Thank you all!
If you talk to nursing home administrator, simply explain they need it without having to ask, it is very simple for her to change order. They will quickly call doctor and make order. Takes 15 minutes.",2022-04-11 21:21:13,Big-Cat-3079,u1n2t1

Dementia,"Is your mother a ""wanderer"" ?","I'm working with an organization that's helping us finding a home best suited for my mum. Apparently one of the deciding factors in regards to price is the added security to the question of ""wandering""

I have a meeting with them tomorrow and of course in this context does wandering just mean leaving the home and wandering off ? Or is there more to it - like going into other peoples rooms etc.  If it's the latter, I don't have an honest answer for this due to the fact she hasn't been in a home yet and don't know if she is going to be walking into other peoples rooms. 

At home she is curious if I'm on the same floor as her she will come over to see what I'm doing on my pc in the dining room as she passes through the kitchen back to the living room etc.  But if I'm upstairs working she doesn't come upstairs during the day to see what I'm doing and will stay downstairs. 

She has no real desire to go outside besides to sit on the balcony and have a cigarette. 

Is that enough information to answer ""is she a wanderer"" ? I understand eventually as this progresses she may very well become a wanderer and may need to be move to something more secure.","It's mostly has she gotten lost before I believe. Like did she walk out of the house and down the street without telling anyone
Absconding is another term. It’s always a matter of safety ie falls risks, wondering off and getting lost in the community, if she goes into other peoples rooms is there a risk to their property or privacy. She hasn’t lived in a home yet so don’t worry too much because you don’t actually know what she’ll be like yet. Also, wondering around is extremely normal for someone who’s expecting cognitive decline, they all do it if they can walk.
My dad absconded (they may be losing their minds but they're sneaky af) and we had to put special locks on the doors that he can't get off, though he's tried.

Edit to add: The final straw that led to the locks is he got away and went walking a few streets over. He was walking in the middle of the street and almost got hit. He's pretty deaf so he can't hear anything coming.",2022-04-11 09:56:54,SoloPogo,u18cva
Dementia,Is there treatment for dementia? Can dementia be slowed down?,"I have recognized some changes in my mom who is nearly 70.  These changes are mainly in mood and aggression over slight things.  There is some senselessness too.   Memory loss and confusion is not a big issue. It's very mild and hardly noticable. The biggest issues that I see is mood and easily angered, and senselessness. 

It's only recently when I am piecing a lot of these issues together and I think she is going senile.   I have suspicions of maybe dementia but my biggest issue here is that it's not presenting with a major loss of memory and confusion that you would associate with dementia and Alzheimers. Every day is different with her. 

I am actually seriously thinking that maybe dementia might be coming in. It's early days yet. 

I'm at a point where I don't know how to proceed. I know she won't be open to me having a chat with her.  She won't welcome that and I think it will be met with hostility from her.  We do attend the same GP practice so I am thinking about chatting to a GP at my next appointment and give her my suspicions of the possibility of dementia and tell her what I am saying her.  Memory loss is limited and not an issue or a huge concern of mine.  It's other things presenting - mood, personality, aggression, some senselessness there's even a type of ocd setting in. She never had ocd when I was younger. 

My question here is -
Is there treatment for dementia? Can the progression of dementia be slowed down? 

If this is the case, It would be worth my while raising my concerns now with a doctor instead of waiting some years and seeing more serious symptoms of memory loss, confusion and losing the ability to perhaps care for herself. If the progression of the condition can be slowed down, I think that would help her and me too.","Can't stop it they can slow it down not to be a downer but   it's all down hill from here there are treatments in testing sounds great but nothing for the now enjoy your time while you have it
Yes, the progression can be slowed. But you first need her doctor to diagnose it, and determine what type of dementia she has. 

There are drugs, exercise, dietary changes, and mental exercises that can all help slow the progression if you catch it early enough, and have a diagnosis to work from.
First off there are many conditions which could be causing these issues in your Mother. If she hasn't had a regular physical in awhile it is probably time and you can also express your specific concerns to the doctor then. Dementia is a progressive disease and no it cannot be slowed down.  There are medications which can ease some of the symptoms, but it will progress regardless of medications taken. Regardless, she needs to be seen by her pysician to rule out an infection or possibly depression.
The best chance of this at the moment is amyloid monoclonal antibody treatment.  Clinical trials are available if your mother has not declined too far.  Donanumab, lecanumab, and aducanumab are the major contenders at the moment with open trials.  

Stuff like diets maybe helpful but aren't going to slow the disease.  Also be well aware of people trying to market their hope to a vulnerable population such as Dale bredeson and Dr amen.
Have her evaluated by a physician. It could be a type of delerium, which is curable. 
Be very careful with advice or suggestions from anyone suggesting a cure for dementia, it's all snake oil. Dementia is a terminal disease.

Mental stimulation is extremely important for slowing it down. My gran in law definitely is in early stages, becomes confused and talks about driving back “home” which is at the other end of the country and she moved a year ago, but when she’s taken out to a new environment for the day and is given something different to do, she becomes totally normal again.",2022-04-11 09:09:43,summerrosegarden,u17ema
Dementia,"My Dad is now home after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia. He doesn’t seem to bad at the moment because his medication is helping, he is forgetful and confused sometimes when he talks about things. But my question is how quickly have people seen dementia advance from this stage?",,"Virtual hugs. It varies from person to person. Even on the FAST scale which is very specific for Alzheimer’s, one could be at a given stage for almost any period of time. Everybody’s different.
No way to know. My mom went from diagnosis to hallucinating 12 hours a day in less than a year.

I wish you the best.
You should know that people are typically diagnosed once the condition has progressed to stage three or four of six stages. He might remain at a certain stage for a long time, years even, but he might also quickly progress.
Every person's journey is different. It could be 3 months to 10 years. There's no way to know.

But getting the diagnosis from his doctor is key to making sure his quality of life is as good as possible for as long as possible. You can now research what to look for, on a day to day basis, to help every day be the best day possible.
My dad was diagnosed about 7 or 8 years ago and his decline has been gradual. He can still feed and dress himself and take care of his own hygiene when reminded. Knows his family members on sight but may not always recall their names. He's pretty dependent on us overall and is never left alone, but we have plenty of good family support.
its very different and depends person to person. Get your dad to walk around if he can, being immobile and sitting all day will make it come on faster. Regular check ups as well since infection can also make It come on faster
May i ask what medication he is trying? My mom was diagnosed a few weeks ago and also looking for info
Just be advised that Alzheimer’s medications can actually worsen symptoms.  I have seen it happen to my dad, MIL, 2 aunts, and it happened recently to a friend that became nauseous, dizzy, and emotionally unstable after starting Aricept.  She stopped taking it after 1 week and finally 2 weeks later she has greatly improved.  Side effects of these medications can actually be mistaken for disease progression.
I just want to say thankyou to everyone who has commented on this post it really means a lot during such hard times. I give all my love out to everyone who has and is currently going through the same.
My dad was pretty functional for about 6 years after diagnosis.  The last 18 months brought a lot of decline, and we just recently moved him to a memory care facility because he is quite disabled now.
It varies for everyone.  Sometimes better healthcare and activities can help slow it down. Sometimes it doesn't.

Unfortunately, dementia runs in my father's side of the family.  His oldest brother ""Bob"" had it around 2008 and died in 2016.  His younger sister ""Sara"" was diagnosed 2013, her husband, my Uncle ""James"" was diagnosed like in 2018. my father was diagnosed 2015.  My father was doing good for awhile, till he became resistant to take his meds from my stepmother.  And my space cadet of stepmother was afraid of crushing his meds and putting it in his food. Later on, we got a better handle  of giving him his medication. My father had moments where he seemed he was getting better. His dementia got bad in winter 2020 and died in 2021.  My Uncle James died later in 2021.  My aunt Sara is still alive and walking, she recognizes her kids and grandchildren, but is all over the place in her dialogue. So it's different for everyone. 

My Uncle James was diagnosed a few years after my father.  My Uncle James had better healthcare (had a general practioner & specialist for the dementia) then my father and had an aide, plus went to day programs.  He ended up dying months after my dad.  My dad didn't go to the doctors as much because my younger half brother got him a doctor extremely far from home.  We were only seeing a general practioner, no specialist. My father had no home aide and adult day programs.  My Uncle James stopped talked for a year or two before he died.  My father was talking till the night he died. My dad still remembered names of his siblings, children, ex wife, and wife.  So my cousins did everything they could do for their father and he died pretty quickly, while their mother is still alive and had the same treatment her husband had and got dementia before her husband. 

My Uncle Bob who died in 2016, stayed pretty lucid for a long time. I didn't even know he had dementia till like the last 3 years of his life. In the end, he couldn't talk and walk anymore, and wouldn't eat. They had to tube feed him through the nose.  

So I'm saying all this to say with every dementia patient it is different. I have heard people deteriorate like a few months after diagnosis and die 3 years later. While others get diagnosed and have a very slow mild systems for like 7 years, then gets worse by 10th year and die like 15 years after being diagnosed.
It definitely varies. 

Mom was diagnosed at the end of 2019, and I read that most people are diagnosed at mid-stage. She's now in late mid-stage, which seems really fast.  She's incontinent of urine, can't clean herself after any bathroom visits, and is starting to lose her words.  

There is also some stats out there with estimated durations of each phase of Alzheimer's that can give you a loose timeframe.

Dementia,Feeling helpless - any advice is appreciated!,"My family is 99.9% sure that my great grandmother is suffering from dementia. She hasn’t been medically diagnosed - because we can’t get her to agree to go to the doctor. She absolutely refuses. Her father and her sister have both passed away with dementia. She has good days, and then she has bad days. She is 87 and my great grandfather is 87 as well and he is so tired. We need home healthcare but we cannot get her to go to the doctor for referral. She doesn’t think she needs to go, but she is getting worse. She’s taking Prevagen (when she can remember to take it). Please, any advice on what we could do is appreciated.","Could she possibly be “tricked” into a doctor’s appointment under the guise of a routine physical? Let the office know what’s going on ahead of time so they know to do an evaluation. Some ideas off the top of my head- your grandfather can just remind her as if the appointment was made a long time ago, or say the doctor’s office called to say she is overdue to come in. You could try saying that insurance requires an annual physical and there is no cost for it (although if she hasn’t been this year, there’s probably a small Medicare deductible to meet). Or you could make the appointment and ask the office to call with a reminder and have her hear it from them.
I don't know how this stuff works but texhincally you may be able to call poliece or an ambulance. She is not cognitively herself and is at risk of becoming a danger to herself and maybe others on accident. She is a person but without that condition should she be the one making the choice to go to a  doctor?
You might be able to convince her to see the doctor if instead of focusing on her getting checked to maybe the two of you or another family member go do together. Could help since it's no longer a focus on her but another and be reassuring if both did a check up. It's an option if outside of the family isn't an option or would be more difficult. You could also check with a social service about possible assistance or resources.
Our dad had dementia. Unfortunately, until there is an official diagnosis, not too much help will be available. ALZ can offer community support services but help in contingent upon a confirmation of her diagnosis. We had quite a few options, because of referral services from his primary doctor. His primary had to certify him for hospice care.
Does she attend church or have other important people in her life who are not family? Because sometimes it needs to be an outside person (not family) that they trust and would listen to. Pastor? Favorite hair stylist? Idk that it would work but it doesn't hurt to try to get someone else to bring it up. 
""Have you seen the doctor lately? All this crazy stuff going on the last 2 years... I'm going to see --insert doctor name-- you should too. We gotta stay healthy.""
Can you hire help without the referral?
Depending on your local healthcare system she probably needs to see a general practitioner first, and then be referred to a neurologist to get a definitive diagnosis. 

I agree too that the easiest way may be to just make the appointment, take her and tell her something like the doctor’s office made the appointment, insurance requires it, etc. Therapeutic lying goes a long way with this disease.

Also, if you can, email the doctor beforehand and detail all the things you are concerned about. Or write a letter requesting it be placed in her medical record. I did that with my mom because I knew we wouldn’t have time to cover everything during the visit. It helped the doctor focus on specific aspects of her memory loss. It can also help because dementia persons can often “showtime” for a short period of time, which is basically they are able to hide their memory loss and appear to be fine. My mom is really good at that.
Check her insurance medical coverage, many now have home visits available If she does then get one set up, maybe less resistance if she is seen in her own home..
My mom has been denying the disease and refusing to go to the doctor for 5 years. Suddenly she lost 20 pounds and my aunt took her to a general care appointment to which he told her that yeah, she needs to gain weight (and that she most likely has some form of dementia). I've now set up a neurology appointment telling her that it is a nutrition appointment to discuss her brain to gut connection since it seems to be not working as well as it used to, especially because my grandfather has the same issues. Ive been waiting 4 months for this appointment and it's now about 2 weeks away. It's a major struggle to say the least, but calling the ALZ association has been so comforting and helpful to me. They're so kind and have a lot of great advice and comfort.",2022-04-10 19:47:37,g00dvibezzz,u0ub9z
Dementia,Looking for a GPS/tracking watch for my parent with dementia.,"My family has been watching my father progress with dementia for years now. He's got good days, and bad days. More often good minutes and bad minutes these days. He doesn't drive anywhere or do much, but sometimes he's sneaky and will get up and start walking away while someone is either in the bathroom or kitchen. He doesn't have a phone anymore because the ringer just made him scared or upset.

He's recently been asking for a watch and my family is trying to find something that not only tells time but they can also live track location on GPS in the off chance he ever walks off or figures out the locks. Does anyone have any recommendations for a good GPS watch for an elderly parent with dementia? 

My mom would like something that could call too, but I don't think he'd understand the calling piece of a watch. The GPS piece feels like the most important. 

Thank you in advance.","Look into something called AngelSense.   It is not a watch but a gps device.  Originally created for kids with autism, it also works great for wandering dementia adults.  We had this for my dad and he was able to walk his  dog independently for probably an extra 9 months.
My dad had dementia. Don’t waste the $$ because he’s gonna take the watch off anyway. He won’t remember what it is and take it off.
Another thing to consider is installing cameras on their property’s entry/exit points. We used Ring and it was super easy to set up.   This will let you know if and when they leave, plus alert you to who visits.
We kind of use an AirTag for this.  We removed the speaker from it.  They don’t have a smart phone so no phones alerts.  I hate using it this way, but it is the best solution I could think of.

We have it attached to their purse, but if she consistently only wore one set of shoes we’d have hid them in there. Being on the purse also makes it easy to find when she misplaces it.

Why we went this route is batteries.  Most active GPS things have a day or so of charge.  At that point you’re hoping someone in the house remembers to charge it.
I bought a LandAirSea 54 vehicle tracker for that purpose, but it ended up being bigger than I expected. It's about the size of a hockey puck. I can put it in her coat pocket if we're going out in the cold, but otherwise its too large to hide. If you could use it in a fanny pack, that might work. There is a monthly subscription fee.",2022-04-10 19:37:10,BayouButters,u0u41c
Dementia,I need advice from those who have been here.,"I am caregiver to a family member. She is forgetful and often can’t repeat what she just said. Sometimes yes is really no and no can be yes, you just to have to figure it out. She doesn’t want to bathe or wash her hair. It is difficult to get her to drink enough water which leads to constipation. She recognizes her grandchildren but has trouble recalling their names. On the dementia F.A.S.T. scale she seems to land into level 6, but not all of the way in. I understand she will need to be in level 7 before hospice will help. I think when the test results come back she will be diagnosed with vascular dementia. I know no two people will deteriorate at the same rate or in exactly the same pattern, but could you give me some idea of what to expect and how long the stages will last before the next level. Thank you for reading my frazzled description.","My grandma has vascular dementia. She is stage 6 approaching stage 7. She also has aphasia that impacts her speech. In her case it seems to be 6 or 7 months before we see a new decline. Usually she forgets a skill that she did okay on previously. 

Example- toileting herself. 4 years ago: She would go to the bathroom. 3 years ago: She might need to be reminded and needed very little prompting in the bathroom. 2 years ago: She began to need more reminders and prompts. 1 year ago: She would rarely take herself and might not know her clothing was wet. This year: Now she very rarely will know she needs to toilet and sometimes doesn't even realize she is soiled. 
Last few months: She has less understanding of what toilet paper is for and that she needs to be wiped to be clean.

As the disease has progressed the plateaus have gotten shorter. I pretty much figure every 6 months to look for something else to fall off. This time it was folding laundry, which she used to enjoy. She understands folding things in half but that is as far as it goes.
Vascular dementia is one of the types of dementia that cannot be a primary hospice terminal diagnosis.  The FAST scale is mainly used for Alzheimer's where it is a linear scale such that there is not skipping around the scale to identify the level.  Other dementia's typically involve taking the worse reading to have a ""general"" idea of where the person is at.  Hospice typically considers FAST 7A (stages 6 and 7 have substages) to be a starting point of terminal, HOWEVER, the idea of terminal is a prognosis based on ALL the related diagnosis, not just the primary.  Therefore, the patient's PCP can present an order for hospice eval and treat and hospice may find the person is indeed terminal based on several criteria.  

What typically helps is a journal keeping track of any weight loss, amount of time spent sleeping vs. awake, how much help the person needs, etc.
My mother was diagnosed with mixed dementia (VaD + AD) in 2020. Before that, she was a resident in a local hospital until the govt found her a place in the aged care facility.  That's where she is until I could travel (we live in diff continents).
We facetime chat twice a week and I could see the changes during these conversations.  In less than 3 months after moving to the facility, she lost all her mobility (thanks to the understaffed clinic). She has had a series of falls (5 last year and 2 this year <and counting>). I've seen her hallucinates, her episodes of sundowns, her deliriums, her rashes and scabies, her weight loss...

All these changes I've journaled and shown on her youtube dementia channel. You can check her out here: 

https://youtu.be/3HiFXpBH9rg

Though no two people are similar, I cannot tell how fast and what changes your loved one could decline. Depending in what type of dementia and other health condition she has may be helpful in estimating her dementia  stage and life expectancy.

One thing I could tell is there is never a time when I don't feel like crying..it hurts to see them struggling. We tend to see our struggles as carers (it's Hell) but it helps me by reminding myself that she is all alone, navigating what little life she has with her dementia. And that she is slowly dying. So, I'm packing up and will travel in a few weeks to care and be with her.

It will be long goodbye.

Thank you for posting. Take care of yourself, as carer, we need even for a few hours, time for ourselves.
Our dad had dementia, we were never told what type he had. We planned to rotate in and out to take care of him, we just didn’t know when. He walked out the door locking the screen door behind him in subzero weather. A neighbor saw him pried the door open and called me, we moved in that night. It was 2 1/2 years we took care of him round the clock. His appetite was good, he just kept loosing weight. His kidney function went down, his PSA was high, his primary said he probably had cancer. He gave us a hospice referral and daddy went on hospice 04/28/2021 and died June 5th. The last three weeks he just slept and refused to eat or drink which is common with dementia patients.
My uncle was diagnosed back in 2020 with vascular dementia but had noticeable symptoms prior to being diagnosed. He's seems to be declining at a monthly rate imo and if I had to put say what stage he's at then I'd say 6. He can not communicate with sentences that make sense,he is now fully incontinent and refuses to be cleaned mostly, he now argues with the tv so I play music or cartoons and I have to coax him to eat or drink sense his appetite had decreased. Some new things happening also is he can no longer tie his shoes which he knew how to a month ago and he's beginning to hate leaving his chair. Its such awfully slow process and depressing to watch a loved one wither away in this manner. I'm not sure what the next few months will look like let alone the rest of this year. I'm sorry you and you're loved one are going through this. I wish there was an actual time frame or scale to figure out how long this suffering lasts.
In my grandmother's case, each injury accelerated her dementia, particularly the broken hip. After first few injury rehabs she got better somewhat but never back to her prior baseline. Become bedridden, stop doing a routine every day, muscle memory for ingrained habits evaporated quickly and UTIs became constant.
My grandma was up and down for years. Now she’s pretty constant with straight up hallucinating all the time, incontinent, nearly always in bed. 

Her sis had dementia and was bedridden in the later stages for about 8 years. In my experience, it’s been very slow, but with sharp peaks and valleys that come out of nowhere. With my great aunt, I’d think “she won’t last another two weeks”, but then she’d be fighting with the staff and eating normally the next day. Crazy stuff.
Hospice helped my mom when she was at level 6. It's worth asking for an evaluation. The worst that can happen is they will say ""not yet.""",2022-04-10 19:30:33,KlaatuBarada1952,u0tzey
Dementia,Venting,"If the grim reaper showed up for my dad today, I’d gladly invite him in and offer him coffee and a plate of cookies. The dementia is eroding my soul.

Not because I don’t love him or am tired of caring for him (although that is often true), but I am so sad to see him suffer.  Outliving one’s brain is such a horrible way to exist.
My mom is at that brief stage where she realizes what's happening to her (sometimes) and it's SO damn heart-breaking to see her in terror of losing herself.  She wants it to be over already...It's damn cruel to make people live through dementia after most of who they are has already flown.
It’s just awful.  Awful.  Fun funny happy life-of-the-party best friend and hubby is no longer a hubby.   We waited for these days to have fun together and travel but no.  Now it’s just doctors and poop.  It is not a life for us or our terrific grown kids who love their dad.  Stinks. SMH
I was so relieved when my mom passed. Almost 12 years of watching her die from dementia and all the awful problems that went with it. Of course I cried and cried when she was taking her last breaths, but what was saddest of all was how a vibrant, active, intelligent woman slowly disappeared and became difficult, combative, incontinent (both ways), and faded away.
I completely understand this sentiment.
My brother keeps thinking “it won’t be long now” for our dad but he’s in decent physical health so actually, yah, it probably will be a long time and it makes me mad/sad.
OP, I’m so sorry. I’m with you here, I really am.

I’ll preface my post by saying that my mother was really difficult throughout my life—she had her fleeting good, lively moments, but she was more often angry, sadistically unkind, and sometimes violent. She had horrible depression and self-medicated with alcohol. Anyhow, her dementia began after a series of mini-strokes in 2000. When my dad died, ten years ago, she went into an assisted living facility where we ended up shelling out extra for a private nursing team. We got panicky phone calls in the middle of the night, so we stepped up her care to 24-hours (on top of the AL costs). Eventually she made it to the top of the waiting list for a memory care facility. She’s getting the care she needs, but it is a dreadful, depressing place. She spends most of her time in bed now and generally refuses to answer her phone. Every so often, my brother calls me up (I live across the country) with the “any day now” alarm, and out I come. By then she’s usually rallied, rallied meaning that she’s back in a wheelchair and saying that she wants to go back to bed. To all of you who are giving hands-on care, I salute you, and I acknowledge the privilege we have in having our mother in a safe place. 

I haven’t had the sunniest relationship with my mother, but it fills my heart with sadness to see her being drip-fed oblivion by this disease. 22 YEARS. The woman is 93. My brother and I secretly long for the relief of “that call”. My husband, who is a real sweetheart, comes from a more traditional Eastern European background where you just don’t voice that kind of thing, so I keep it to myself.

So OP, I feel for you with all my heart. What you’re feeling is valid and utterly understandable. Sending you thoughts of strength.

Dementia,No more weekend naps for me,"My mother is suffering from LBD. She usually gets a lot of aimless energy in the middle of the day. She walks back and forth, moving things, talking to hallucinations, opening doors, “cleaning”, etc. Most of the time I’m at work when she gets this way, but during the weekend, I’m home and usually keep an eye on her so she doesn’t get into anything too dangerous. This helps give my dad a break. I used to indulge in wonderful, cozy weekend naps on the couch that I looked forward to all week. I can’t do it anymore. Her dementia has slowly become worse and she requires more attention from caregivers now. If I take a nap on the couch, i have one eye open. I am still paying attention to my mom and have to listen to her marching back and forth for hours, so I can’t take my naps anymore. I’m not trying to sound selfish.

We live together and his demented mother lives with us.  I go to work Monday through Friday and he works on Saturday and Sunday.  He's home with his mother during the week and I'm home with her on the weekends. 

My husband and I can't have a normal conversation unless his mother is asleep. If we try to talk to each other when she's awake, she joins in with off the wall comments and questions, or she brings a card or magazine to read to us, or she gets angry that we aren't talking to her.

I hope you find a way to gets your naps. We need some normal.
It's good to have your Dad there to help. It was me and 6 cameras inside that I needed. Was impossible to keep up with my Dad. Had to sleep whenever possible. Especially when I was being woken at 3am asking why I'm not cooking dinner.

Well said.
Dementia sucks

Our dad died from dementia in June. Five of us, well 4 1/2 took care of him at home for 2 1/2 years. We talked to his primary doctor, who took exceptional care of our dad, and explained he would ""sundown"" pretty bad after dark. He did the walking around with his coat on, waiting for his ride to go to work or church. He held business meetings or prayer meetings, all at night, which kept us up. He prescribed a low dose Ativan 0.5, for him to sleep and us too. We still slept with one eye open, just in case(we still do out of habit). It worked out well for us. 

Maybe next appointment bring it up with her doctor? Caregiver burn out is real. We rotated in and out every 4-5 days. When I left, I came home, showered then slept for 12 hours
oh my gosh i miss naps so much !! i'm the type of person who will lie in bed for hours and hours if i'm allowed, and i haven't had any quality nap time lately. i just wanted to say you don't sound selfish at all!
I'm going through the same right now, except she does the wandering all night as well. I'm lucky to catch more than an hour of sleep most nights and try to take quick cat naps when she does in the day. I feel your pain and I'm so sorry",2022-04-10 14:44:18,Xellossthecutie,u0o1sx
Dementia,need advice,"my grandfather has dementia and due to a recent stroke, his whole left side cant move thus making him not mobile he also cants control his bladder and often wets the bed.

I don't think we can keep doing this forever and when he is at work I don't know how we will carry him. Were thinking of getting a maid but not a nurse or anything due to the cost but I don't know to what extent the maid can help.

Dementia,Family visit or not?,"Firstly thank you for any advice you can give. Apologies if this is too long, I'm not sure how much is relevant. 

My Dad was diagnosed with early onset alzheimers in Dec 2021. He copes fairly well day to day doing routine things currently but his ability to communicate has dropped off a cliff. Most conversations will include I Don't Know or I can't remember. Hes doing his best and can still drive and shop although only for items he regularly gets. He can't problem solve or follow simple instructions well and has lost the ability to communicate pain effectively. He does, mercifully, seem to have sort of lost the ability to be stressed outside of when he is fixated on something and cannot do it. 

He lives with my mother who is physically disabled 

He originally comes from another English speaking country and it is a relatively short trip over there. I have asked him and he says he wants to go visit. He has lots of relatives there who would appreciate a chance to see him before he deteriorates. I am willing to take him and be his carer for the duration which would likely be a couple of days at most. I know that I will be doing the brunt of social interactions and it would likely be staying with his brother, maybe a family dinner and some minor driving around (me driving). 

What I am concerned about is throwing him out of his routines and undermining him in his normal day to day at home. My mother would not be coming because she has no interest in going (separate issues). 

So can anyone give me some external thoughts on whether to go through with this? I'd love to be able to facilitate this but I don't want to prioritise his families desire to see him over his needs.","Take him on the trip.

It will be good for him to see his family AND for the family to see him in his current state (both for support and to establish a baseline in their minds regarding his decline).

A few tips:

Know & respect that he may pull the plug on the trip before you leave if he feels uneasy. Likewise, he may ask to go home sooner.

Watch that his routine for meal times, medications and sleep are strictly adhered to.

Have lighted paths to the restroom, kitchen, etc. at night so he doesn’t become disoriented or fall. Watch for fall risks due to small floor rugs, pets, clutter, etc. 

Have available local numbers for medical facilities, and his Drs., etc in the event of an emergency.

When you return home, don’t just drop him to the door, but help him readjust to his routine.  Your mom will also need time to readjust to having him back home. This may require your being available a few more days after the trip.
I think it's a lovely idea.  It will be exhausting for you though, if you can afford it you should think about bringing someone to help.  Hiring a support worker there is an idea too so you could have some time to yourself.  And talk to the relatives too, they may want to help.
Just know that taking him away from home, even though he wants to go, will be confusing for him and he might suffer a decline.  Routine is so important to them and being at somewhere which is not his home will be confusing so he will most likely need more assistance. On our last family vacation my husband could never find the bathroom at night even though it was only five steps from the bed.  He would wake me saying he was lost, he also did not participate in most family activities. We have decided no more vacations because it is hard on him.  That being said, you should go ahead and take him, could be the last time he sees these relatives, maybe have someone who can help you with him so you are not on duty 24/7.  Good luck!",2022-04-10 04:37:47,Balasars_snoot,u0dhug
Dementia,My grandma just died of Lewy body dementia and I'm so heartbroken. No one in my life cares about their grandparents the way I do and they can't seem to understand,I was extremely close to her. The disease stole her. Covid made it hard to see her. She didn't really understand the phone so I couldnt even really call her. Now she's dead because a nurse gave her Covid and the Parkinson's complicated things. My partner isn't being supportive. I feel so alone. I can't even say goodbye,"I'm so sorry you lost your Grandma and in these rotten times we're living in.  If you're feeling unsupported please seek out some therapy.  We are all under so much stress and worry, adding grief to that can be hard to handle.  Take care of yourself.
I'm so sorry about your grandmother. My dad has Parkinsons and Dementia and it can be difficult day to day when your immediate support isn't going through the same thing. I find this forum really helpful for finding people who ""get it"".

It may be good for you to find a personal way you can say goodbye to your grandma.
My husband has LBD and I currently have pneumonia. I’m acutely aware that if he gets sick or has a fall, then it could be “game over”. I’m isolating while sick but not well enough. 

Maybe a good response to your partner’s “stop whining” is “that’s not helpful for me rn. I need time to grieve”. Find others in your life that can help you grieve. Partners can’t always provide the validation you need. 

While I think I’m prepared for it, when the time comes, I’m sure that my grief will be immense.
Hi, OP.  

First, let me say I'm so sorry for your loss.  

I'm also extremely sorry that you are in position where you feel very alone.  

My grandparents are two of the most important people in my life.  They always have been.  

Thankfully, I have other family members who feel similar.  


However, I totally get what you're saying about many other people.  

I've witnessed how many friends and coworkers have dealt/responded with the deaths of their own grandparents or offered condolences to others.  

There's a lot of, ""Well its sad, but they were old, you know?"" attitude.  An idea of just quickly moving on.  

But when the time comes for both of my grandparents, who are 90, I truly feel like I will be completely devastated for MONTHS.  


This may not be the time, but I'd consider reevaluating your relationship with your partner, given her response (especially after reading your other reply here).  

Please remember that your grandmother loved you, and she **knew** that you loved her too.  

I'm sorry again for your loss.
My dad recently died - parkinsons with lewy body dementia. So sorry for your loss. It is a tough disease to go through and witness
I am so sorry for your loss OP.

Your partner may not have the words /actions to show support but this doesn’t mean he/she doesn’t care. Grief is very personal, and to say/do nothing other than risk the wrong thing may be where he/she has settled.
I'm so sorry, you're not alone and people do care about you.  I know nothing can take away that pain - not just of death, but leading up to it with LBD.  

Have you used Headspace before?  They have a meditation course on grief and it's been so helpful to me dealing with my Nana's dementia.  Either way, many states have a warm- or support line you might be able to call in to get the support you deserve.",2022-04-10 04:23:45,817394000013090937,u0dbju
Dementia,How did you convince your loved one with dementia to go to a doctor and get tested for dementia?,"I am In a very complicated situation my landlord's mother has some type of mental Illness I think that it is dementia but I am not sure because I am not a psychologist or a doctor. I know that she has some type of mental illness because when her daughter aka my landlord dropped her off at my house I noticed that she had some strange behavior she would leave food on the stove walk away forget that it's there until it is burned, she mopped our floors with shampoo and conditioner, and she bought plants from home Depot put them in the sink with our dirty dishes and said that she was recycling the water. 

 I don't know if my landlord is in denial or if she does not want to deal with her mother. But my landlord has dropped her mother off at my house and forced me and my roommate to watch her mother two times. Every time I try to talk to her about her mother In a calm professional manner she either ignores me or gives me an excuse. I don't know what to do about this situation I tried talking to a lawyer about this and they said that because I am renting a room in a house I cannot stop her mother from coming onto the property. 

I don't know what to do about this situation I am thinking about calling adult protective services on my landlord. Because I think that my landlord is abusing her mother by dropping her off at our place and forcing us to watch her when she knows that me and my roommate have no mental health training or experience, we have no idea how to take care of her mother and we do not have the time to watch her mother. But she still chose to drop her mom off here. I think that is very irresponsible and shows that she has poor judgement. 

I know for a fact that her mother is going to accidentally hurt herself or someone else if she does not get the help that she needs. I know for a fact that the law says that if you are a danger to yourself and other people you have to go to a mental health facility. I am worried that if her mother does not get the help that she needs she is going to hurt someone or herself and if that happens she is going to have a cop and a social worker knock on her mother's door and force her to go a mental health hospital. If that happens my landlord is not going to have a single say over where she goes. If the court finds out that my landlord knew about her mother mental illness and did nothing about it then the judge is not going to allow her to be in charge of her mother's care. I don't know about you but I would not want a stranger from the state to have complete control over the type of care my mother receives.","Definitely call adult protective services
Why is your landlord dropping her mother off at your house to begin with?
Just so I am clear, you rent rooms in a house the landlord Owns. The landlord leaves her mentally impaired mom at the house, where she is not a resident in what appears to be shelving her for a few hours.

What does your lease say? How many occupants allowed, is your rent offset by hours spent caring for the mom? Are you or your belongings at risk? 

Consider speaking with an experienced, local landlord-tenant law attorney to get helpful legal advice.

Study the lease terms of the rental agreement carefully and know your legal rights and responsibilities according to federal, state, and local laws.

If there is a problem make sure to notify the other party immediately and be open and honest in all your dealings.

Make hard copies and notes of all correspondence regarding any problems with the tenancy.

Edit: this can be grounds for terminating your lease early (which I would do) so get everything in writing. Offer in writing with mail delivery confirmation, to terminate the lease early (without penalty to you) due to this change in living situation that was not known/agreed upon at the time of signing the lease.
It definitely sounds like dementia. But it isn’t a mental illness. It’s a neurodegenerative condition. She definitely shouldn’t be manipulating you into taking care of her mother, but it doesn’t really qualify as abuse.
What a crazy situation! I would call adult protective services if it happens again and make sure they know this isn’t the first time. Taking care of this lady isn’t part of the lease, so if there’s a next time she comes you can lock up your stuff and leave the house. You are not liable for whatever happens and it will teach your landlord not to do it again.",2022-04-10 04:06:08,Amirasalam123,u0d389
Dementia,...but I'm only 30...,"I'm just wondering if there is anyone else out there my age. My doctor is referring me to a neurologist to be sure, but she's confident that I have dementia. I won't bore you with all the details and symptoms (I can't remember half of them anyways), but I'm honestly floored. 

Things that I thought just made me ""quirky"" or ""eccentric"" are apparently incredibly concerning signs, and things are getting dangerous when I have my less lucid moments. 

I was just getting my sh*t together. I have a decent enough job, I was going to move across the country with my fiance, get married... I even started puttig things in motion for retirement plans by 50 for passive/part time income. And now this. From everything I'm reading, I might have another 8 lucid years. 

I watched my grandma go through this. She didn't recognize her own children and thought I was her daughter at the end. To say I'm terrified is an understatement. Today I had to tell both my fiance and my best friend that in a few years, I might not recognize them.

Is there anyone else my age going through this? What do you think causes this? Is it just bad genetics? Did I overwork my brain? Is it something we did to ourselves somehow?","OP, I'm sorry to hear this. Do you have a familial mutation that has been confirmed?

If not, I would be very surprised that a GP is ""confident you have dementia"".

If you don't have a confirmed rare mutation for early onset dementia, I would  try to worry less about dementia in particular until you've actually seen a neurologist.

If you do have a confirmed mutation for familial early onset dementia, seeing a neurologist is the right step. And remember that it's not possible to get dementia by ""overworking your brain"".
I currently have pneumonia caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae and it can infect the brain and cause dementia-like symptoms. It’s normally a very mild pneumonia but for various reasons, it’s hit me hard. 

TL,DR: various infections can cause dementia-like symptoms. Insist on a full blood work up.
Get a second opinion. Seriously. Dementia at your age is exceedingly rare and sitting down with another doc might be worth your time. I'm not suggesting your doctor isn't competent. They might be 100% right, but I'd be more likely to accept the situation on the weird of another provider.

If you decide to go this route, get copies of your records to show the second doc. 

I wish you the best of luck.
I work in Alzheimer’s research. One area specifically is with frontaltemporal lobar degeneration, or FTLD. Most of our patients are over the age of 40, but I have seen some in their 30s. It is very rare, and I absolutely recommend genetic testing before coming to this conclusion. If your doctor has not already brought it up, ask. It is typically genetic. 
As a side note, visit clinicaltrials.gov and see if there are any research studies near you. They will usually pay for everything, including genetic testing, MRIs, PET scans, lumbar punctures, etc if you join the study. And you can make a huge difference for science when it comes to learning more in how to diagnose, predict and treat dementia. Even patients who test negative can still be involved as control subjects.
As others have said you need to see a neuro psych for cognitive testing.  That is the only way you are going to get a diagnosis of cognitive impairment.  I also agree you are too young to have a diagnosis of dementia.  I would assume there are a whole lot of medical issues which can cause symptoms which might look like dementia.  Honestly, my husband has dementia and I never thought to call him ""quirky!""  Go get some tests so you have a real answer.  You seem like you are living a good life, you have future plans, don't let what the GP said derail you.
> I'm just wondering if there is anyone else out there my age. My doctor is referring me to a neurologist to be sure, but she's confident that I have dementia.

I can only imagine the fear you felt when a ""doctor"" told you this, but wait until you hear it from the neurologist after the scans they'll need to confirm this. Doctors are wrong some times. I also think it's unprofessional for a doctor to tell a 30yr old they have Dementia even if they suspect it, they could say I think you need to see a neurologist and leave it at that.

30 yrs is extremely young for dementia, as in Unicorn rare.
I agree with most posters here, a general practitioner/primary family doctor should refer you to a neurologist who can do an assessment.

Note, a neurologist specializes in one field, and if he/she doubts your GP assessment, might refer you to someone else to sort out your diagnosis. It may be a number of things you are dealing with.

In the interim, look at your diet (some gastro issues can cause malabsorption of key nutrients and can cause symptoms of disorders); do you have high or low blood sugar? Do you have celiac disease or an autoimmune condition?

Check if any meds you take regularly have side effects or shouldn’t be taken together (your pharmacist can help with that).

Have you had Covid-19? You may have some long hauler lingering effects from that that have exasperated an existing condition. 

There are MANY possible explainations, besides very early onset dementia.

Get a second, or even third opinion.
It’s very rare to have a diagnosis of dementia before you’re in your 40s- that’s usually early dementia diagnosis range.

What are the signs that make your doctor concerned? Did you go through genetic testing and that’s why she’s so sure? That would be the only thing I could think of to make them sure.

There are literally hundreds of other things that can cause memory loss, inhibition control issues, quirkyness ect that should all be explored way before a dementia diagnosis.

My top guesses from limited info and your age would be ADHD/Autism (I assume most intense sign is having a bad memory lol) , hormonal issues, vitamin deficiencies, covid-19 recovery or possibly something else neurological/mental such as bipolar 2 or smthing along those lines. These are all WAY more likely than dementia.
A FAMILY DOCTOR CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT DIAGNOSE YOU. Go to a neurologist. You could have another issue that presents as dementia but can be treated.
Brain fog/mild cognitive impair is commonly seen in recovered C-19 patients. I think it's very unfair for your GP (who btw is unlikely to be qualified to make this assessment) to suggest that you have dementia at all, but especially given the pandemic. There are many things that it could be that are treatable, curable and not a death sentence.

&#x200B;

Good luck to you.
The only dementia you could possibly get at your age is either Fronto temporal dementia (inherited), Wernicke-korsakoff (alcoholism or gastro issues), or Creutzfeldt-jakob disease (inherited or sporadic), Huntingtons (inherited), Parkinson's (inherited) or Autoimmune encephalitis (sporadic). These are all rare mostly inherited things. Unless your MRI and PET are showing atrophy relative to any of these conditions I'd get a second opinion. I wouldn't give up just yet and believe that's what you have there's so many other explanations. These doctors want a pay check and they will say and do what's easiest to receive payment. Exhaust all other outlets and diagnosis before settling on Dementia. I wish you well and sending prayers your way.🙏👍
>Things that I thought just made me ""quirky"" or ""eccentric"" are apparently incredibly concerning signs, and things are getting dangerous when I have my less lucid moments.

Please can you share what those signs were... I've been described the same way.
You need an MRI on your brain now as a baseline.  They can SEE the changes dementia makes on the brain tissue.  INSIST on an MRI!  They were poo pooing my mom's dementia away until I got quite angry and they finally did an MRI--and lo and behold, she had significant narrowing of the memory centers.
I haven't seen this mentioned in the comments, so I apologize if I missed it and I'm repeating something that's already been said.

I'm wondering if it's possible you've had a TBI (traumatic brain injury). Some of the long-term symptoms of TBI can [overlap with dementia symptoms](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/tbi/conditioninfo/effects). A neurologist should be able to help you make a distinction.

I've known a couple people with TBIs and they have been able to have relatively normal lives and families with some additional help/support for their cognitive differences.

ETA: the more I read your description of your symptoms, the more I think you should ask about TBI as a possibility. TBIs can also include changes to personality so that's something to ask the people around you about
What gave that doc that much confidence that you have dementia at 30?
At 30, you would be one of the youngest cases in recorded history. The dementias that hit younger people are pretty much genetic. Did your grandmother get it when she was young or old? The type that people get when elderly is not really hereditary.

Get a full workup. Bloodwork, MRI, CT scans, all of it.  There was recently an article of a 23 year-old woman who had spent months in private residential treatment for severe mental illness, in the ER about to be send to a locked psych ward because she was suicidal... when one doctor decided to do a CT of her brain for the FIRST TIME. She had hydrocephalus and was cured by one (1) surgery.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/02/12/medical-mystery-mental-facility-ct-scan/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/02/12/medical-mystery-mental-facility-ct-scan/)
I have had 3 relatives with dementia, and dealt with 3 different GP's. None of the GP's stated they were ""confident they had dementia"". Instead they said that they needed further testing. They also carried out blood work to rule out other conditions that can mimic dementia before the referral. 

The relatives had a battery of testing plus scans before any diagnosis took place. One relative looked like a classic case of Alzheimer's - very elderly and forgetful. Turned out she'd developed a rare neurological condition instead. 

Conditions that need specialist tests can't be diagnosed in a GP's office. The GP may suspect a diagnosis, but they can't be certain without the test results. Similarly even a neurologist can't diagnose without testing. 

If I'd been given a £1 for every medic who decided my relative had Alzheimer's on meeting them I'd be going on holiday with the money. 

As a family carer, one thing I've learnt is to wait for a definite diagnosis before worrying. Yes, I know, it's easier said than done!
Unfortunately...Your doctor is uneducated on dementia and stepping outside of her wheelhouse.  A neurology consult is good as they will likely roll their eyes at this referral and deduce you do not have a neurodegenerative disease.  

99.99% of cases in your age range are cognitive deficits as a result of severe stress, anxiety, depression, ADD, other psych disorders, etc. 

 I think it's pretty unacceptable that your( I assume) primary care physician would even say the word dementia to a 30-year-old.  This is what caused you to go speak with your fiance and friend about this supposed dementia and very very likely caused unnecessary and undue worry for you and your family.  I would recommend finding another primary care physician, to be honest.

While I cannot definitively say you don't have dementia, the likelihood is so infinitismal that no one should be saying those words to you without the proper training and education and testing completed.

The fact that your grandmother had dementia does not correlate to inheriting dementia in yourr 30s at all.  Late on set dementia with a genetic component causes late onset dementia on offspring.   Not a super early onset.

I noticed in another reply you stated you have had declining issues since 2014.  Any true neurodegenerative disease starting 8 years ago and in your mid twenties would have progressed so rapidly that you probably should have been dead for the past 3 years.

The symptoms that you describe in your other replies really seem more based in a psychiatric realm.  Things like not remembering how to go in reverse for 5 minutes is not a typical symptom of dementia.  It is probably either a psychiatric issue or seizures.

I'm sorry you have been hit with this.  Even I am upset at this preposterous premature diagnosis and I'm not even involved :/.  Please proceed with the neurology visit and share with them as much as you can remember.  I also recommend again to find a new PCP.
I find this extremely unusual. Could you explain more about any symptoms of confusion and why she thinks you have dementia? It’s not impossible, but at 30 you most likely don’t.
[deleted]
I treat MCI and very early dementia in my practice. Feel free to DM me for some resources. Consider finding a functional psychiatrist in addition to your neurologist. There are some really powerful interventions using nutritional and functional psychiatry that can be don early on.

Have hope. ❤
What kind of diet do you eat.
I'd look into the book, The End of Alzheimer's: The First Program to Prevent and Reverse Cognitive Decline by Dr. Dale Bredesen. I experienced mild cognitive decline I'm my late 20s and some of the techniques listed in the book are definitely helpful. Depending on the severity of the disease, you can incorporate some or all of the program.

Your diagnosis isn't the end. You, and your support system, can do many things to improve your prognosis.

Best of luck my friend.
I don't know what causes dementia I don't know if it is something you did to yourself I think that you should ask your doctor those questions. I don't know if you have a good support system if you do you should lean on those people and ask for some support.

Dementia,My Friday Funny,"This happened last night and I'm still laughing about it.

My wife, in 4th stage dementia, is still pretty lucid most of the time. 

She went to bed at her usual 10:30 ish.
Around 11 she walked into the living room and asked me if I would take her to Target tomorrow to get a new bed sheet. Well, yeah. Good night.

I went to bed at my usual 12:30 ish.

At about 2 am she wakes me up and says the phone just talked and said ""Turn left in a quarter mile.""

I did not hear this and we both agreed it was probably a dream.

About 2 hours later I hear. ""Make a U-turn in 1000 feet."" 

I looked at her phone and she had mapped directions to Target but didn't shut it down.

I'm not sure how to finish this up, but hoping y'all get a laugh out of it too.","That's pretty funny!  Matching up a little confusion with a little technology that's almost too smart for its own good.

Dementia,Advice needed,"My mum, in her mid 70’s, has been bed bound since a bad fall. She is receiving home care. She will never walk again and is slowly fading away. However she is showing signs of dementia. She did recognise me when I saw her last month for the first time in 3 years, but she thought the balloon on her bed was the TV and she tells me she gets up regularly to walk around.. she hasnt walked for months. So, do I humour her and pretend that the balloon is the TV and that she can walk, or do I try and be honest with her? Thank you!","This could be a sign of an infection, such as a urinary tract infection. Any changes in cognition like this should be checked out medically asap because an infection can turn into sepsis and kill her. I would not assume it is dementia, and treat her as if she has dementia, unless a doctor has diagnosed her with dementia. Everything else needs to be ruled out first.
I eventually always went along with whatever my father said. You can't fight it, anything and everything you say to counter their fantasy is wrong. It just stresses out both parties. He used to say that ""they"" are getting in through the WiFi and  changing actors in his movies (like they put Bruce Willis  in as lead actor in gran torino, replacing Clint eastwood). I initially tried to explain how that was impossible but that only agitated him further, making his behaviour worse. I started just agreeing with him, listening to his complaint then telling him I'd fix it, later telling him it was now fixed. Diversion helps too. I sometimes said while I fix it so they can't get back in, you check the backup drives and see if they have gotten in there too. Before long he would find something on the backup drive like an old TV show or something and be focused on that instead.
I wasn't living with my parents at the time so my mother copped the worst of it. The kicker: She's an RN in a nursing home. Had to put up with it day and night. It's so hard not to get frustrated. I would call my mother often and we would laugh and joke (not in a horrible way, just de-stressing) about the latest crazy thing he had said or done. It's often the carer that dies first in these situations. I'm in Australia so a fairly similar public health system to old blighty and over here you can get I think it's 4 weeks/year of respite care for the afflicted either free or heavily discounted. Might do your dad good to have a few weeks off. I wish you well man, it's a hard downward slope. I was just kind of coming to terms with the fact that my father was no longer my father ( just a crazy old man) then he died. It's a terrible thing and it runs in my family so I've got something to look forward to.",2022-04-09 15:20:23,madaboutdogs7,u008is
Dementia,I'm worried that my dad (68M) might have dementia but be very early on in its clinical course,"almost 30 years ago, he was electrocuted, and his brain was aged 10 years overnight, total personality change, and doctors found classic multiple sclerosis lesions, saying that in another 10 years he would probably be unrecognizable 

since then, he has had his ups and downs, but he hasn't changed a whole lot since the mid-90s, for the most part, except perhaps gained a little bit of maturity 

my mom and I were talking on the phone earlier and she made some casual remarks that sounded eerily familiar, being that they sound like a lot of things my friend has observed in dementia patients she treats as a caregiver 

the things that set me off initially:

1. my dad has always been a socialite, hyper-extraverted, socialization is what he lives for, but my mom said on the way to church (a 40 minute drive) over the past 6 months or so, he mostly seems dazed and stares off into space, usually not speaking a single word until directly asked a question 
2. at his church, that he pastors, he has special reserved parking but keeps forgetting where it is and parking elsewhere in the parking lot 

that's the main two that set off alarm bells but there are others 

he has also shown signs of not comprehending certain things, or not remembering them, such as when he was introduced to my ex/close friend in November and, despite being told no politics/religion by my mom and I, he immediately went into politics and then religion 

that was pretty incredible because he has always been the kind of person who could hold down a normal conversation with a wide variety of people, he's met plenty of my friends before and had never done anything like that before, it was actually shocking 

so I don't know, I'm no expert, but something seems off and now it seems like more is off than I realized 

does any of this sound familiar? is there anything else I should be looking for?",,2022-04-09 14:06:29,,tzyrao
Dementia,Wanderer in the facility getting into bed with Mom,"My mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. Last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. She was understandably terrified and had a meltdown. Lots of ""I need to get out of here"" and ""I am going to stop eating"". We got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything ""clean"".  It seems like it isn't the first time this poor man has done this but it's usually not at night. 

Mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her ""apartment"" (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or  not), but she must have not locked it. We talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. So all seemed to be under control. 

Until it happened again two nights ago. There's definitely no malicious intent by this poor man - he's definitely unaware of just about everything around him. However - my mother needs to feel secure in her room. 

Has anyone experienced this before as either the LO of a wanderer into other people's rooms or as a person who's LO has a wanderer show up in their room?  I am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. TIA.","Your mother isn't the problem resident. The facility needs to have a bed alarm and motion detector on the wanderer's door. They are responsible for keeping him out of beds that aren't his.
You may need to call her every evening (or set a phone reminder if she still has some tech skills) before bedtime to make sure she has her door locked. 

My mom is in a great facility but it’s hard to rely on staff for small things like reminders because they don’t have the same staff working the same shifts every night.
I had to move my mom to another facility, in part due to this and a few other issues. I was told locks on the doors were illegal. We're all happier with the new situation.
>...without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible.

You actually *should* make a big deal of this, both for your mom's safety and the man's. The main purpose of a care facility is to keep the residents safe. Wandering such as this means someone is remiss, which is not safe for anyone. How established in this facility that they don't already have measures ready to address this, which should've been a consideration on their part from the very beginning?
Ugh.  My dad is a bit of a night wanderer.  I don’t think he has climbed into bed with anyone but I was told that he slept in an empty bed in an unoccupied room the other night. I also notice that he is wearing someone else’s shoes these days.  I have no idea where his shoes are.  I also found a pink walker in his room the other day.
Not had a parent in a care facility but wondering if you can give your mom a “panic button” to raise an alarm when the guy goes into her room?  Might just be enough reassurance for her to feel supported in having someone get him out if it’s not entirely preventable from happening. Obviously you’d have to ask all the supervisors on duty to be aware and help when the alarm button goes off?
I work on a dementia unit and I have to be honest. When putting people into homes sometimes it happens. Most facilities don't lock residents rooms and we just try to redirect, however with short staffing being a daily thing in almost every home here, having to be the nurse and watch 23 people with dementia, and having my psws in a room helping one person with care, this happens a lot.

Some things at our home we have done is the following:

- Talk to your facility about getting an infrared alarm outside of your mother's room. This will make an alarm when the sensor activates, so if anyone goes in, it alerts the staff to go to her

- Sometimes big yellow tape we also put in front of rooms, sometimes residents see it and it reminds them of poliece tape or do not enter signs and it usually works as well.

I know it hard but try to be really understanding, that man may be just as confused and trying to find his wife (a common thing that happens to us), it's really hard but we want to try and help everyone we can snd understand the diesease affects everyone differently
Buy the old man a comfort animal to sleep with.
Each state has a long-term care ombudsman you can call.  They are screened and trained volunteers (20 hours of training time) that will work with you and the facility to come up with a solution.  They can't levee fines but facilities usually like working with them because  they can escalate to the Residential Care Services (who monitor nursing homes).  Residential Care Services can come in and levee fines if they need to.
Check closely in the paperwork on the facilities policies in regards to wandering and other behaviors. Some of the nicer places will have clauses in their contracts stating that residents cannot invade others personal space, or disrupt the enjoyment of residents daily routine or something along those days. Ultimately it’s the facilities responsibility to ensure this doesn’t happen and if they cannot this man needs to be in a more secure facility.
Sorry your mother is having to go through this, it's not ok or safe. Wouldn't it be easier for them to restrict this one man's movements rather than trying to lock every other room in the facility to prevent him entering? He's most likely doing this to other residents, too. It doesn't seem like they are really doing anything about it, and that's concerning.
Hi OP, what a stressful situation. This is unacceptable for many reasons. The facility should keep track of the wanderer - a motion detector is a common tool for this that is pretty easy to use. However, they ofte give a *lot* of false alarms in rooms, especially with wanderers. An alternative would be a motion detector by your mother's door! 

I just want to emphasize that while this wandering man is innocent, bad things can happen. I have worked with a resident who believed a very nervous lady in the same facility was his wife. He managed to convince her of this. They both had dementia and the man pressured her for sex\* - thankfully it was discovered before anything happened. Condoms and viagra was found in his room! You never know. I would seriously pressure the facility to take this very seriously, especially since it has now happened twice.

\*he had no way of knowing that she was not his wife and did not understand that she wasn't able to consent. Very difficult situation.
My mother wandered. In the middle of the night, she used her neighbor's bathroom and then crawled into bed with her. The facility said if it continued they'd have to move her to another, higher care,  floor. 

A doctor prescribed melatonin to help her stay asleep at night. If that didn't work they were going to prescribe sleeping pills. The melatonin did the trick.
There are day/date/time clocks that you can set alarms in too.
In the facility my mom was in, they had bright yellow ""tape"" which was actually just kind of like the retractable boundaries like they use for lines that they put across the doors of night wanderers. I know in some states that might be considered restraints but it was the only thing that worked.
I wonder if he climbs in bed with more than just your mom? If so, what do other LO do to try to resolve the issue?",2022-04-09 07:47:01,cobaltsvaleria,tzrjye
Dementia,Advice for parent who refuses help ?,"My mother lives alone and about 5-6 yrs ago I started realizing something was very wrong . She would cry for days over an imagined social scenario, imagine that people around her would “ tremble” when they see her , imagine people on her roof , imagine that someone was damaging her car etc . Whenever I suggested that she needed help she would go ballistic and scream that she wasn’t crazy and would not be given poison pills so that she could feel nothing . At the time I offered as much support as I could by offering to go with her etc. I even called her PCP once and although she couldn’t disclose her medical information she listened to my observations about my mom and did tell my that yes she was aware . Due to Hippa she could not disclose but suggested I accompany my mom to her next appt. I had asked the Dr to please not disclose that I had called her . Well, fast forward a week and my mom called me and screamed at me for contacting her PCP and of course would not allow me to the appt . I did find a scan once of her brain while visiting her and tried to quickly read it before she caught me but it was all medical jargon. I remember it did note shrunken vascular activity in the frontal lobe . Anyway , my mother has only become way more paranoid , resists any type of help and is extremely verbally combative . She has no assets so I’m not worried about her finances . She has always been on govt assistance.  What are my options if any to get her help ? And no , her moving in with me and my family is not an option as I would not be able to handle her.",How old is your mother?,2022-04-09 07:25:43,Summersnail,tzr8xk

I have been her full time career since we lost my father in June of 2020. Exactly spot on with it being the worst and best experience of my life. And I too held on to the happy moments and will cherish them forever. 
I am happy and humbled to be with her now in these finally moments. 
I just happened to sneeze and it woke her and she asked “what was that?” I said “I sneezed!” She said “Good grief” lol 
This has been a labor of love but I wouldn’t change it either. Peace to you all!
God Bless you indeed!
When you say full-time care do you mean you have full-time caregivers or you do it yourself full-time?  If so, look into how you can get some help. Try your city or county’s department of aging and see if her doctor or the hospital you use has social workers. If she has income or assets, use it to pay for as much care as possible. You’ll still spend time with your mom but don’t shoulder the burden of doing everything yourself.
I must say that that is adorable!  Made me smile!

Dementia,Rapidly deteriorating mental health,"After 4 years of complete isolation and heavy drug abuse I think it’s time to stop. I’m completely dis functional at this point. My thoughts are sporadic and incoherent, it’s hard just to make this post. Over the past half decade I’ve watched myself go from highly functional to being a shell of a human. I could make friends easy, had a gf, had a job, was super productive and was steadily progressing in life, Now I can barely think. I don’t think I’ll ever recover from this and I’m done trying. Through the past 6-12 months I’ve put in real effort in improving and have made zero progress. My life is nothing but constant anxiety and dysphoria. I feel like I have dementia. I’m constantly tired but can never sleep. I have headaches and random pains throughout my body, I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m riddled with cancer. I desperately want to end my life but I have a massive family and suicide unfortunately only affects other people. The discomfort is becoming overwhelming. I’m paranoid and stuck in my head. I’ve had nothing but my own repetitive thoughts to think about. I’ve been living alone in a single room for years now. People in prison are punished with a life style like my own. I’m completely exhausted with life.","This doesn't sound like dementia or cancer. Everything you're experiencing may be attributable to heavy drug abuse. Please do seek help, no matter how hard it is. Start with your local doctor. Just tell them what you told us.

What you've described is a problem that seems utterly overwhelming but is in fact treatable. Your symptoms, and the circumstances of your life, can be improved. Go to your doctor.
There is help for you. Keep moving forward. You can do this. I have 2 grown children who have been in your shoes. They hooked up with Behavioral Health type services and are steadily making progress. Don't give up on yourself.
Actually your “answer” is in your “TITLE”...... deteriorating mental health!! Sounds like you need a Psychiatrist who can really help you with this! There are some great medications out there that can really help you feel good again. All those years of drug abuse affects your mental health in a huge way! I’m not a saint and have been through some hard times with drugs as well. I’m an ex international model whose seen the dark side of the business...! Trust me on this and please start with a mental health counsellor perhaps. Sounds like severe depression perhaps. The hard part is making that first step!!! But once you do, you’ll be thankful..!!!

Dementia,Bringing my grandmother home.,"Hello I am new here. Last summer my grandmother had a major stroke that caused brain damage resulting in dementia. Last month she suffered a cold and went severely down hill. Crazy what a cold can do to an old person I guess.  Anyway, she can barely walk or talk now and moves very slowly. I was afraid to take her home in the beginning because she was causing shenanigans and was generally very angry. I am hoping to get a 6 month prognosis and get her on hospice.  I am a stay at home mom with a 6 month old. I will not have any help from family. And if anything, very little help professionally.  I feel like my grandmother will die soon, because of her recent and fast decline. Shes on lots of meds that make her sleepy, I think about taking her off them to see if she gets better but I am afraid to. Any tips and encouragement? I have a meeting on the 12th with the nursing home.","[deleted]
Dementia social worker here and current nursing home social services director. I would only decrease one or 2 meds at a time. Given her history of stroke, she could likely have some behaviors that are masked by all the medication and the only way to know what she really needs is to take it slow. Also ask them for a hospice referral from their medical director
I highly recommend against bringing Grandma home. Around the clock care is what she needs and you can’t provide. Once her spot in a home is released, getting it back won’t be easy. 

If a simple cold brought her such ails, being around An infant/ toddler who has constant exposure to colds isn’t ideal.",2022-04-08 21:32:03,Cold_Pressure5351,tzigc2
Dementia,Can dementia change your political beliefs?,"My grandma has Lewy-body dementia and recently moved to memory care. She’s always been somewhat moderate to conservative. Voted republican more often than not in the last 20 or 30 years, but is still a registered Democrat because she never got around to updating it.

But more than just what her voting habits were, she has always had a strong conviction that politics are *personal*. She gets offended when canvassers come to her door to ask who she’s voting for — not because of the annoyance of the door knock, but because how dare they ask such an invasive question. To her, politics are a private thing you only talk about with trusted people.

We’ve always been close, and Ive always been interested in politics and vocal about my own politics, and when she was mentally well we would discuss things occasionally. And still, all these years later, the above info is just about all I could tell you about her politics. Most people in her life have no idea if or how she votes at all. Any comments she’d ever make about politicians were decidedly not political — she felt sympathy watching Biden speak about his son, she respected John McCain for his service. That kind of thing. Surface level, polite, personal, not inflammatory, nothing to do with policy or party. 

All of that background to explain: she suddenly has a LOT to say and it’s kind of weirding me out. She hates Kamala Harris, apparently. That came out of nowhere. But ever since a few weeks ago, every time Harris is on screen she has a snarky comment, and today while Justice Brown Jackson was making her speech, grandma was yelling at the TV that she better watch out because Kamala was gonna get her for taking up the spotlight. 

She has newfound very strong opinions about our mayor, too, who is so incredibly moderate and milquetoast that I didn’t realize anyone could have strong opinions on him. She has decided she dislikes a handful of anchors and pundits too, and dramatically rolls her eyes and makes little comments anytime they’re on the screen. Like a teenager!  

I wish she didn’t like watching the news so much otherwise I’d turn it off, but she insists on having it on all the time. It’s often on mute and I’m not sure she notices that, it doesn’t stop her from making her comments. She’s not hurting anyone, and I don’t argue with her, so she can hate whoever she wants I guess. But it’s just so *weird* because she was never like this before. I’m wondering if anyone else has seen anything similar?","Dementia patients often lose critical thinking as the condition progresses, yes. They more easily fall for emotional pleas (common in certain political circles) and find it harder to follow or understand more difficult concepts. IMO this is part of why scamming old people is such a big market; tell a 50-year-old widow that you can speak to her husband as a psychic and she'll probably laugh you off (or curse at you). Tell an 80-year-old the same and a surprising number can be suckered in.
Definitely. Dementia changes everything about a person for the worst unfortunately. It can turn the sweetest nicest person into a violently raging nightmare for absolutely no reason sometimes.
You are perfectly describing the story of ""The Brainwashing of My Dad"" documentary on Amazon. It is time to cut off media that makes her upset. Use the parental controls on the TV to block all the 24-hour news channels and the Weather Channel, no more newspapers, talk radio, or junk mail. 

Look for better things for her to watch. Old TV shows, animal documentaries. YouTube even has drone footage flying over cities.
My mom asked if she could poke a guy in the nose for no apparent reason yesterday.  He hadn't said or done *anything* to warrant this degree of hostility.  Yea, it's a thing.
Dementia patients frequently parrot what they hear on television. My Dad would tell us that things happened to him which were just on the news or in a television episode. 

Personalities change, too. Dementia changes everything.
Dementia tends to make them lose their ability to emphasize with others and imagine life in another’s shoes. Take that as you will.

Dementia,MCT oil but not low carb diet?,"Hi. Trying to figure if MCT oil will make a difference. And get info to help guide family decision making since we all have different opinions. 
If someone with Alzheimer’s uses MCT oil but doesn’t reduce carb intake - and therefore is not on a ketogenic diet - will the MCT oil be worthwhile?
I’ve googled extensively and can’t find any research to this particular question. 
Thanks in advance.","I'd like to know about this too, OP. Good question
It doesn't seem that there have been large-scale studies on MCT oil for AD, so it might not be worth much ketogenic diet or not. I did find this promising but small study in which a ketogenic diet was not used: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8919247/

Dementia,Community??,"My mom has early onset (F59) and I'm very young (M22). It's finally come to a head and she got laid off. No one my age can relate and they're all very uncomfortable talking about it, especially when I joke. I've been expecting it a long time so I've come to terms with it pretty well and I've been a caretaker before so I know what to expect. But it's still lonely. I don't have older adult friends who have seen parents decline, had their mom forget their name. I need people who get it and don't try to relate my mom to their dead grandpa. I need advice. Who do I talk to? My therapist is nice but she also doesn't get it. My spouse is supportive and going through it with me, but they haven't done this before either.

Are there support groups? Workbooks? Book clubs? Do I just tread water? I'm out of my depth.","I’m very sorry you are dealing with this at such a young age.

Your town should have an Alzheimer’s support group or similar.   Some of the things they and others here on this forum can council you on are the following:

Make sure your mom has 
-an advanced healthcare directive.
-has designated you or another trustworthy person as the power of attorney 
-go to your mom’s bank, with her, and have her add you as co-owner/signer of the account 
-with your mom, have her doctors add you as a trusted person to discuss your mom’s healthcare 
-consider at some point you may need to look at assisted living/memory care places, or have hired help come in periodically to give you a break.
-make sure all her finances are in order and that her financial institutions have you (or whoever she might have designated) on file as the power of atty

There are probably half a dozen or more considerations I’m not recalling off the top of my head but definitely find your local Alzheimer’s group or Council on Aging type organization.
The 36 Hour Day is the most well-known guidebook for this. 

Are you in the US? Mom should qualify for unemployment if she got laid off, possibly long term disability and SSDI.
I myself go through the same thing. My mother was diagnosed when I was 24 (lost my father at 22). I'm lucky to have siblings though so I'm not totally alone.

I would try to look for or start a sub community on Reddit (like this one). If feeling alone gets worst, I do suggest seeing a doctor who may provide some medicine for you to help with temporary depression.",2022-04-08 14:39:33,tooyoungforalzh,tza8xi
Dementia,Choking on soup,"Opa has now started advanced choking. He eats very very slowly. I know that dementia affects the part of the brain that controls swallowing. But I don’t know what to do, my parents are leaving me alone with him more and more (we all work but now it’s getting pretty drastic to leave him alone). If he chokes and it gets stuck in his air ways the only thing I could do is call 911 and I honestly don’t know if they would come fast enough. It’s really morbid but it is reality. 

His eating has been on and off. Sometimes the refusal of food and sometimes he wants breakfast, lunch and dinner. Which I assume is the dementia, but he won’t want soup all the time. And he is very picky. Do I just make him shakes and smoothies when he’s home with me? I worry about his health if he eats candy and ice cream for all meals   (He would probably love that lol) any suggestions or tips would be very helpful.","First off please work on getting training on dealing with choking. It’s part of extremely basic first aid such as the Heimlich maneuver. EMS can take 15 minutes to an hour for some geographic locations and if somebody is truly choking on food most likely will have died by then or even worse being a situation that any recovery will mean that the person will have severe deficits above and beyond what they may have now.

In terms of the textures of food and liquids. In the medical profession we refer to food as being regular texture if you can eat anything without having modifications done to the way the food is prepared. The next downgrade from regular texture is mechanical soft which is typically cutting the food into small pieces, making sure that the food itself is soft such as pasta or mashed potatoes. A lot of times we have the equivalent of mechanical soft if we’re eating softer foods that are in smaller bite-size portions. The next texture is purée where the food is put through a food processor to turn it into a pudding like thickness almost like mashed potatoes but just slightly thicker.

When it comes to liquids if you can drink almost anything that’s refer to as thin liquids.  If a person has trouble swallowing thin liquids the general approaches to use a medical grade cornstarch to slightly thicken the liquid so that it’s like nectar thickness. When pouring something that is nectar thick it almost looks like you’re pouring molasses. It still pours rather quickly but slower than if you were pouring water. The next step up from there is honey thick which pores just like honey and have the consistency of honey. The next thickness after honey thick is pudding thick which I don’t know a single person who tolerates very well.
Have you spoken to his doctor?  It sounds like he should be on hospice care at this point, or at least evaluated.  If hospice does not take him then they can get you some resources. You need to have a serious talk with your parents about getting him medical help now, before he does choke and there is nobody around to give immediate help.  Honestly, this is not a problem about what he can and can't eat, this is a very serious medical issue.
Puree the soups so it is all one consistency. A soup that has a broth and chunks of stuff in it are difficult for a compromised person to manage because the person has to contain the liquid in the mouth while chewing the solid pieces. With old people and people with dementia, what often happens is the liquid will slip down the throat on its own, without the person actually swallowing, and that's what causes the coughing/choking. Other ""mixed consistencies"" to avoid are things like very juicy fruits - for the same reason.
We have my great aunt ensure nutrition shakes. You can get them at most stores in the US. We got her the chocolate ones because she started really only wanting sweet stuff at the end and we told her it was chocolate milk. I am so you and your family are going through this.
Not all forms of dementia cause problems swallowing. A proper diagnosis of Alzheimer’s vs FTD vs LBD, etc. would help determine that.
It sounds like a swallow study may be appropriate. His PCP could order this or neurologist if he sees one. It could be a different condition causing this problem as well.
you should get him evaluated to see what he can eat. Some people need thickened fluid or different textures.",2022-04-08 13:56:19,MatrixBunni,tz9b71
Dementia,"Light at the end of the tunnel, sorta","For the past 5 years, we have been taking care of my FIL. COVID royally screwed everything and he went downhill FAST. Needless to say, we are just done. We have a two year old and we just want our space, ability to focus on him, and selfishly, our freedom.

Fast forward to Wednesday, he woke up and chose violence, and quite frankly, that's the last straw because we don't want that around our toddler and we don't know if this will become a habit. Yesterday, I spent most of the day calling everywhere and everyone to see who could take him within our budget. I found it. I found out there are assistant living homes that are actual homes and they take 5-7 people for 1-2 caregivers 24/7. Finally! Only problem is, there's a $350 gap between his social and how much it costs.

Is anyone aware of a way to find grants that could close that gap? Or anything like that? I mean, on paper, that's not much, but over time, especially when wanting to buy a house nowadays, it is a lot and it's money that could be used for our son.

My daughter is in homeschool and I leave the house for about two hours a week on sundays, with the FIL.. 

The last time I was away from the man was 104 days ago (Christmas Day) 

I don’t hate him but every time I look at him I want to scream. He is an asshole who defends the son who collects his SS checks but NEVER comes to help out.

I am at a breaking point but I am trying to stay strong for my daughter and husband.. 

I know it sounds selfish but I just want to be alone for a while. I don’t want to hear shuffling footsteps from pops, clean out his bedside commode, go catch his dog that he lets out, EVERYTHING!

Ugh, there is so much more to bitch about but I don’t have the time or energy.. lol

Sorry for the rant.

Hugs to everyone going through it.","Time for his sons to step up and put him in a care facility. Maybe you need to walkaway and let your husband know you can no longer do this.

I know that sounds cold, but I have resided myself that I to have a breaking point and I don’t want to get there with my mom. So if that means I put her in facility and my other family members and angry, than so be it. They are not the ones taking care of her, just watching from the sidelines.
If someone else is collecting his SS and that money isn't going to FIL or his care, that's financial fraud or abuse. You probably need to check in with your state or county's senior department, advise them what is happening, and ask for a social worker. They may be able to help you move him into a memory care facility. 

Don't feel bad about turning in asshole family members that are robbing an old man who cannot defend himself. These people deserve to be punished - that's your FIL's money HE PAID INTO. Your BIL is literally stealing from his father.

Edit:  also, hubby needs to step up. This bullshit of men dumping the care for their relatives on their wives and partners is bullshit.
Don’t under estimate the effect this has on your daughter as well. Sounds like it is time to move him into professional care.
Its ok to rant and vent your frustrations since this is a lot to go through and its not selfish to want a break and to want more help from those who really should step up and shoulder some of this burden. I have big time sympathies for you and I feel you as a FT caregiver too. If I may also say it's disheartening and freaking unfair to you that he has sons who ought to relieve you of this stressful situation. I can relate since it is common for family members to disappear in your time of need. Hugs and thanks for all you do and I hope you get some much deserved alone time soon❤
Please look into how you can get those SS checks away from the son who never visits. It’s a pure shame he’s robbing his own father.

Please look into putting the FIL in a facility. I’ve been through the family backlash as well although they were never in sight when I needed help.

Sending lots of hugs ❤️
Get an elder attorney and look into options for turning over to the state to care for him.
I think ranting helps keep us sane. Hang in there.
Your being female may be why it has become your job.  Simply give notice that you aren’t available for this and his social security check can pay for a caregiver.  Then block all attempts to guilt you into and do not discuss it at all.  You are not a slave. You weren’t born to spend your life carrying for your husband’s dad.  Let him figure it out.
You should call Adult Protective Services and report the son who is keeping his dad's SS checks.  That is financial abuse of an elder.

Dementia,An analogy,"You're driving along a country highway, going 50mph, no problems, it's a nice day, and then --

You come around a curve and there's a farmer's tractor going 10mph.  You brake, you downshift, whatever, no danger of a crash, you're just forced to slow all the way down to his speed.  You don't hate him, you don't grudge him, you're just stuck behind him while he putters along.

Every time he gets to a four-way stop, he looks to the left and he looks to the right, and it takes him a minute to decide he can keep puttering along forward. At 10mph.

You're starting to get a little annoyed, and frustrated.  After all, nothing against the farmer, but you've got places to be, things to do.  You didn't set out to crawl along at 10mph.  This isn't your speed.

But it'll take as long as it takes.  No way to speed things up.  A test of patience.

(I suppose if I had achieved full enlightenment, I'd then take this analogy to a regular highway, where I'm going 65 but jamming up some youngster trying to go 85...)","And if the farmer was aware of you and considerate (or a loved one in their right mind), he would let you go around him (they wouldn’t do the things they do).
This is a beautiful allegory, OP. If you’re a writer, you should expand on it.

Dementia,Home care without professional support?,"My Nana is deteriorating pretty quickly, I'm her primary caregiver and she doesn't trust most people anymore. Before she started showing signs of dementia, she set up medical/legal protocols to prevent her from going to a care facility and she didn't want medical intervention other than regular doctor visits for her other health conditions.  How realistic is it for 1 or 2 people to provide the level of care someone with dementia needs? Is there anything I can do to try to make sure she's comfortable and safe?

Info on caring: my mom and I make all her meals, help her walk, take her to social events, do all the household chores and maintenance.  

Info on my Nana: incontinent but can change herself, sometimes needs help with clothing, sometimes knows she is forgetting and getting confused beyond what's normal (she used to be a nurse), can usually walk with a cane, is sometimes very suspicious of and doesn't seem to recognize my mom (her only daughter), frequently has confused or illogical thinking.

Other: I work part-time, am in school full-time.  My mom owns a business so she has flexible hours.","In my opinion, you need someone to help. You will both wear down and need breaks. The constant grind of a schedule will get to you and and you can resent your loved one. At some point you will need a third person, so my thought is introduce them into the situation earlier rather than later. Every person and family has its own dynamic, so your mileage may vary, but it is good to have someone trusted to be able to us. If there is something that requires both you and your mother to attend to, you will already have a trusted person who is familiar with your schedule and your grandmother's daily schedule.
Are you getting paid for the care work? It is all very nice to say that you do not want any professional carers, and it is within patient autonomy to refuse treatment. But you cannot force your family to work for you. She seems to be guilting you into doing that job for free. It seems ill thought out, naive, and manipulative. 

I would certainly take advice, from both a lawyer and a social worker or adult protective services. Safety concerns may override patient autonomy, but that is a very complicated area, and whatever you do, you want to do it with the backing of the relevant authorities.
That you have to ask suggests that, no, you can't do it all. And it's going to get more difficult than it is now; dementia doesn't do spontaneous remission. There may be plateaus, but it will go downhill. 

I don't know what the legal paperwork is. And I do support death with dignity, autonomy, and all that other good stuff. 

That said, what are your legal responsibilities as your Nana's caregivers? Can you talk with the lawyer that set up the documents? Get him or her to talk you through what you are and are not obligated to do, or not do. (Although that lawyer would be representing her interests, not yours… your own lawyer would be a better choice.) Or perhaps your area council on aging, or the Alzheimer's Association, for a non-legal opinion, a starting point?

Two basic concerns. (1) When do you cross the line from ""taking care of a frail person as per her wishes"" to ""elder-abuse"" by following her wishes in a way that could be construed as negligent, and thus abusive? (2) I'm not a lawyer, but it doesn't seem feasible that your Nana could have waltzed into a lawyer's office and said ""write me up a document which forces my daughter and granddaughter to be my slaves until I die, without their consent."" Yet if I read your post right, that's what you seem to be describing. 

None of this is to say you don't love and respect your Nana. But what does that even mean with dementia in the picture?",2022-04-08 08:02:23,CaptKirkSmirk,tz1ytu
Dementia,would you tell if this is frontotemporal dementia or not?,"Hi everyone, i visited recently a neurologist because I had a constant headache with terrible contraction and low ability remembering ... I had these symptoms as long as I can remember ... But they were milder when i was a kid ... And they constantly got worse year after year ... But when i was 18 ... Things got way too much to handle ... I've seen many doctors but they failed to diagnose me properly ... Until now in my 27 ... My neurologist did an EEG ... And showed up that my frontal lobe signals are weaker than they should ... he ordered an MRI to have more information about my condition ... I'm gonna have it as soon as possible ... But until now i don't know what causes this frontal lobe abnormality ...  Juste from the information above ... Do you guys think that there is a chance that this is frontotemporal dementia ? Or probably something else ?","No, what you described doesn't fit FTD or any other dementia.  Also, at 27 it's super rare to develop dementia.  Significant stress, anxiety and depression can cause your symptoms.  Also psychiatric disorders can cause slowed frontal lobe signals.

Dementia,Everyone is miserable,"My grandma has been deteriorating for a while. But she just got really bad recently.

I mean, she was kind of a reckless driver and told the same stories/repeated the same things a lot, but i didnt think it was a big deal.
Now i know it was.

I don't think i appreciated my time with her enough. I'm only 14 and my mom is killing herself as her caretaker. She's been bedridden for a few days and her mental capacity has been dramatically fluctuating. I've only seen her once since she got worse and i feel like i don't want to see her ever again.

I held her hand as she told me not to remember her like this. She isn't fully there in the head but when she becomes more lucid she seems aware that she is a burden and weak in bed. At least she still remembers me.

My mom runs multiple businesses and is always busy, and now that my grandma requires constant supervision everything is going wrong.

Caretakers are so expensive. My mom seems miserable, and i feel like this is driving her insane. Literally. I don't want to lose her, too. I hear her talk to me about making sure that things are gonna be ok when she dies. Making sure i split everything evenly with my brother. Making sure I'll have access to her bank accounts. All because her mother didn't sort all that out for her.

My mom is sane, for now, but we're all so upset. Does it make me a bad person to wish my grandma would pass already, before everything gets worse and she's gone completely? What if this goes on for years and years and years????????? We can't afford that.. we can't make time for that. Everyone is miserable. I am miserable.

I don't want to suffer like this any more.","This always brings the primary caregiver's mortality into sharp focus.  That's likely why she's talking this way.  We see vividly everything our loved ones did wrong and vow not to do the same.  Don't take it personally.  Have your mom look into whether she can get your grandmother's doctor to recommend her for hospice care.
Everything you wrote makes perfect sense and I suspect I would feel the same if I were you. It sounds like everyone in the family is doing the best they can, including you….🙂 Bravo for reaching out btw. Thoughts and feelings are like the wind, tough to control and powerful but they can change direction easily. Don’t be so hard on yourself, everyone touched by a loved one’s dementia gets angry and frustrated, resentful, heartbroken. 

If I could give you a solid suggestion I would recommend reaching out to the Alzheimers Society. It’s super important you get support. Super duper important. I’ve reached out to them in the past and they really help. Someone to vent to that understands your situation exactly and can offer solutions or coping mechanisms.
Sorry you're going through this :(

As selfish as it may seem right now, self-care (for you, your mom, and everyone involved in caring for grandma) is just as important as grandma's care. If you guys are burning out, something needs to change. The entire household shouldn't feel like a warzone because of dementia. It *can* but that's a sign that steps need to be taken to change the situation. 

And no, that doesn't make you a bad person. I've wished that for my dad many times. He's so confused and terrified and angry and sad and... there's nothing I can do about it. Nothing anyone can do about it. It hit him young so he's likely got another decade of life, if dementia doesn't starve him first. It's natural human pain avoidance to want the pain to stop.
Video her telling you stories of old times while you can. She may like music you can play on your phone. Take lots of pics. 

It is sad but cherish her.
I'm sorry. This isn't fair, for you or anyone.
Definitely agree with looking into Hospice care. Here is a link that may help. https://hospicefoundation.org/Hospice-Care/Hospice-Services
I was 14 when I started visiting my grandmother with Alzheimer's after two years of no contact.

It'll be okay eventually. It's always going to hurt, but someday you'll make space for that hurt.
I'm the early days of suspecting dementia with my mom.  I live with her. I do my best. I work hard for a wage and I help at home.  She is displaying a lot of moodiness and anger outbursts and silent treatments towards me.  Then other days she wants to be my friend.  I don't know what way the wind is going to blow on any given morning. 

I'm in an early stage observing a change in behavior with her and I am suspecting dementia.  There's definitely some sort of senile issue with her. 

I dread going home every night after work. I am tired after a days work. I am usually hungry.  I am usually met with a wall of silence and tension from her that you can cut with a knife.   

The pattern for her outbursts is usually silence treatment for days or even weeks before blowing up over the most minor and nonsensical of things.  This morning it was over a tea towel.
youre not alone my father is also in the same situation caring for my grandfather. He always seems so tired and several times already he almost backed out i worry what will happen to him if this continues on and we too seem to have run out of options.

Dementia,"Maybe dementia? If so, where do you go to get an accurate dementia diagnosis?","(Based in the United States if that helps) This is going to be long and I'm so sorry for that but I wanted to share as much useful info as possible.

I strongly suspect that a family friend (70s; M) may be struggling with dementia. He hits all of the marks I've been researching with the exception of hallucinations. This is quite taxing on his wife as she's his primary source of everything (he's very antisocial- always has been- and spends his entire day on the computer). She's been expressing a lot of concern about his short and long term memory, his temper which has always been short but now seems to be on a hair-trigger, and general actions that don't make sense to her; most recently he's purchased a new vehicle which is the biggest concern because if he drives alone, he frequently gets lost and will cruise around for a while until something triggers his memory and he's oriented enough to make his way back.

A few other things that bolster our general concern:

\-In addition to the vehicle, he's recently purchased an air compressor/pressure washer which he does not know how to use nor does he have the strength to operate it safely. He's also been making tons of Amazon purchases (they have more batteries than a literal battery store) that are unnecessary, are incorrect parts for whatever project he's taken to try and fix, or things that he ""needs"" in the moment but by the time it arrives has no idea why he ordered it.

\-Randomly yells profanities at their Alexa system even when she's not offering her opinions, but who hasn't had that urge lol

\-He's making *horrific* comments whenever he sees a POC or LGBTQ+ person on TV (I used to think getting him out of the house more would be a good idea but with these commentaries, I'm rather relieved that he's a homebody). This as far as I'm aware is new, up until the last year he'd have negative opinions of people for specific things like their behavior, if he felt they were dishonest, things like that, but bringing race and orientation to the table is a definite change.

\-He's on a ton of medications for anxiety, depression, PTSD, and physical conditions as well, insulin, testosterone, and something to regulate his blood pressure. He is very protective of these and keeps them locked up so his wife is unsure of what his dosages are or if he's taking them properly. She suspects that based on his extreme mood swings, he's often taking more or less of certain ones though this can't currently be confirmed.

\-He's displaying extra caution? Paranoia? Not sure what to call it but the most recent examples are that he turned their Roomba off because his wife wasn't supervising it vacuuming and didn't want a fire to start. Same thing with their coffee maker; I started a pot, went to the bathroom, and when I came back to the kitchen, it was unplugged because no one was watching it and he didn't want a fire to start.

\-He goes to the VA a few times a year for blood pressure/oxygen checkups and a physical. When he's there, they also give him two other tests. One is a clock where the person administering will adjust the time and ask him to tell them what time it is; the other is a series of words they tell him and then ask him to repeat them back. He completes both the clock and the words perfectly every time.

\-When he leaves these appointments, he says that he doesn't remember what the doctors told him and has thus far refused to allow his wife to accompany him into the exam room for her to track their questions/answers and any info the doctors may share. She'd like to request that he have a more thorough mind exam (I'm sorry, that may be incorrect terminology) but the one time she asked that of them, they said they couldn't unless he requested it. She scheduled an appointment for him at a non-VA facility which he refused to go to since it wasn't through the VA.

So that's where we stand right now. Our concern is growing daily and we feel backed into a corner because we aren't sure how to move forward in getting the help he may need. Happy to answer any questions or expand on anything that's unclear in the comments.","Ok she needs to call his doctors office at the VA and tell them she thinks he has dementia and needs to be tested. Tell her to be honest especially about his unwillingness to have her with him and he forgets everything the doctor says. She needs to look into getting a POA for him. They will work with her.

Oh that clock test? Mom passed that for 4 or 5 years **after** being diagnosed with dementia.
The bottom line is he has to agree to testing just like he has to agree to his spouse talking to his doctors.  Consult with an Elder Attorney to see if there is anything that can be done. Doubtful she can get a POA for health and Finances at this point. He would need to agree to this and doubtful he will.  I also don't think anyone could get guardianship becomes he seems to do OK, a jerk maybe, but he is still managing.  I would call the DMV and get them to test him with the hopes they take his license away.  He has the right to spend money anyway he wants even if it is ridiculous so that isn't a reason for guardianship.  Go talk to Elder Attorney, if there is anything that can be done they will tell you.  BTW in order for my husband to be diagnosed he underwent a 6 hour neuro psych test, I can't imagine you would get your father to sit for that.  Also, my husband did well on those little ""tests"" in the doctors office, those are meaningless.  Good luck.
Hey there! Have you talked to his doctor in regards to his situation? My dad and mom showed the same signs prior to their diagnose which ended up being dimentia and early onset alzheimers.  You could try to see if he'd be willing to see a neurologist or have his primary suggest to him seeing one. I'm no expert by any means but it sounds like it could be dimentia/alzheimers. It's been a very hard and long journey getting my parents the help they need but be ready for a uphill battle.  This disease is nasty but can be handled early if you guys are proactive about getting him seen by a professional. Hope this helps a little but if you need anything else answered, feel free to message me ✌️ Goodluck to you guys
Stick with the VA. His wife can contact the provider's office before his next appointment and share her concerns. Make sure the provider knows all the meds the husband has been prescribed, including the testosterone, just in case he got anything elsewhere. They are fully equipped and very experienced in getting him to the appropriate specialists within the VA - either a geriatric psychiatrist or a neurologist if needed. The VA is better than non-VA medical facilities for working with family and  looking out for their patients because that's really their only job: they're not in it to make money like everyone else. I had a similar issue with my family member - got absolutely nowhere when sharing my concerns with a private physician, and I made one call to the VA and they were on it immediately and provided an immense amount of help.
Does he have a legally binding Health care directive and durable power of financial attorney?  If not, get them as fast as you can.
I'm in a similar place to you with a parent.  It's early.  I think she's going senile.  There's some action ls that would indicate she wants as much control over everything no matter how minor and nonsensical it is.  Then there's a lot of different angry outbursts and other stuff that doesn't make any sense.",2022-04-07 18:07:53,MiskatonicUAlum,tyo60i

Dementia,Losing last independent task,"My Grandma (vascular dementia stage 6/7) would fold laundry. It was pretty much the last unsupervised independent task we could give her to feel helpful. In the last 2 weeks she has seemed to have last the ability to do it. I'm kind of at a loss as to what else I can try to give her to fill her time. 3 days a week she goes to an adult day center so she has time to socialize and get out of the house. 

I'm just so drained trying to keep the house running while trying to give her things to do without also having to spend my time with her. 
We are going to look into someone coming to the house 2 days a week for 3 hours or so.","If you are trying to keep her occupied, give her a basket of unmatched socks and ask her to find pairs, or beads to sort, or stickers to put in a coloring book.  She won't stay on task but she may occupy herself for a little while.

&#x200B;

If you are looking for a chore she can take off your hands -- probably not possible.
It really is tough to find ways to fill a loved ones time and make them feel useful. My uncle he's down to a few things now like coloring pictures or he cuts up coupons and magazines not properly but it keeps him busy so I can get things done. He's so worn out now from the meds he takes and his dementia worsening but sometimes I can get him outside to pick up sticks or blow bubbles even toss a ball to each other. I know it feels like you're not doing enough to occupy her time but there's only so much you can do which is only your best❤
Try to remember the task doesn't have to be really functional, just something to keep her busy. Putting lids on bowls, folding items, dusting, sweeping. The outcome is not getting the chore done but staying active and engaged. Good luck on your journey.
Some tasks I liked to give my grandmother were things that might spark conversation (not sure what stage your grandmother is at there) but I’d give her the photo frames to dust or polish or the many cards she saved to “sort”. Some items would spark conversations about the photos or the card’s content :)",2022-04-07 15:16:30,garden_bug,tykgw9

Dementia,Yesterday a resident at work charged at me.,"As the title states, yesterday at work one of the residents was very upset and charged at me. He did not hit me or harm me because there were people around to stop him, but I believe if he had the chance he would have.
Hypothetically if I was by myself and that happened and I WAS attacked what would I do? What’s the best way to handle that?","I would check with your employer to see what they say. It seems like there would be a protocol in place for handling those situations. And you wouldn't want to do anything that could get you in trouble. 
I know it's scary when they lash out physically. 
Taking care of a loved one in a home setting doesn't come with all the legal issues that being an employee can have. So I wouldn't want to give advice that could legally cause issues. 

With all that said, in my home experience with my Grandma- If she physically grabs me, I try to get her to use both her hands and take them in mine. That way she cannot hit me and I can hold her steady. She has poor balance so if she won't calm down, I walk her backwards until I can sit her down on the floor. She cannot get herself up and it immobilizes her. That gives her time to work out her anger and then we get her up. 

Again, this may not work or (legally) be the best course of action in your case. Sometimes just identifying the trigger can help. If you are able to figure out what set them off you can try to prevent it from happening again.
Try to stop him from attacking you as well as you can. Get some space between the two of you. If you can, just run. Make sure you have a clear path to run if you need to. If you have to hold his arms down you usually can also do that for your own safety. Worse case scenario you just take the hit as well as you can. Plenty of my patients have attacked me. Also try not to stand directly in front of them because they might kick you or spit on you.",2022-04-07 12:32:07,vicuna76,tygx87
Dementia,"Dad has early symptoms of dementia, how to address?","Hi all, thanks for taking the time to read. My dad has been getting more forgetful recently, he's in his 70's and, due to a bad knee has taken some falls resulting in impacts to his head. Such accidents aren't helpful and he refuses to get it addressed privately (knee replacement), despite having the funds to do so.

Just the other day, he forgot some vocabulary along the lines of ""keyboard"" and ""laptop"", substituting them with ""button pad"" and ""box"". He's been using computers for a good deal of his professional life and, even in retirement, he has constant exposure. Other signs are to do with forgetting plans made between us and an inability to understand some simpler concepts like the UK being in NATO (he worked as a journalist for many years so he knows this stuff and we've spoken at length about it, in addition to doing embassy work as an advisor etc...).

I've told him, repeatedly, that he needs to spend some money on himself for his own wellbeing and I'd feel better if a neurologist could examine him. He seems resistant to the idea though (again, not wanting to spend money). Here in the UK, it would be a miracle if the NHS came through for us (waiting times for his knee op alone are at the five year mark and it's only now we're seeing movement on that front). 

He seems happy to discuss power of attorney matters with me but my concern is that unless he exhibits some agency over things, it's going to seem like I'm making decisions for him.

Am I overreacting, how would you go about addressing this?","A medical diagnosis is key. You can't really do anything until a doctor weighs in and identifies the type of dementia. Early diagnosis is important to extending the highest quality of life for your father. And, once you get a diagnosis, then other resources come available to you to help on that journey.

Get his estate and files in order. Get your Power of Attorney done, so you can sign for him and get informed of medical decisions, as well as make medical decisions later on.

Once these two steps are taken - PoA and a diagnosis - then you two can work together to ensure the rest of his life is as good and enjoyable as possible.
Get the power of attorney locked in now. You don't have to do anything with it until you really need to. My father was too far gone when we tried to do it. He thought we were in cahoots with the people who were getting in through the WiFi and changing the actors in his movies (like putting Bruce Willis in as the lead in gran torino). He would just not do anything related to power of attorney. Had to wait until he was in a home before we could do it without him. The next bit is a little grim. Ask what he wants at his funeral. My father told me 3 main things he wanted before he was too far gone so I was able to organise that for him. Later on if your father starts to argue about things, don't try to convince him counter to his argument. In that state nothing you say is right and only serves to aggravate the situation. You can get landline phones with big buttons you can put pictures of people's faces on which helps. Consider an outside motion sensitive camera that alerts your phone so you will know if he goes wandering. One last thing, get him a neck chain or bracelet with name, address, pertinent phone numbers on it. Get him used to always wearing it now. Apart from all that just realise it is a one way street and he will not get better. I just tried my best to roll with it. As happens to a lot of people that go into nursing homes, he died shortly (only 3 months) after he was admitted. Basically do as much as you can now before it's too late, organise things for the future and spend a lot of time with him, photos and video etc, and do some bucket list stuff.",2022-04-07 12:03:06,zante2033,tygad6
Dementia,Advice for less social mom at assisted living,"TLDR: I’m concerned how my mom will fare when we don’t visit since since a bit anti-social, yet complains she doesn’t just want to watch tv all day. How have others here dealt with this?

My mom (moderate to severe dementia) just finished her first week at her AL facility. For all accounts she’s adjusted well to the living conditions (likes her new “apartment”, staff and her are getting a decent routine in place for her basic needs). 

Up to now I’ve been pretty involved - going every day at least a few hours - which I think has been valuable in terms of communicating to staff all her unique patterns of behaviors and best ways to interact with her. I think it would have taken weeks otherwise and my mom would have had a much worse time in the process.

Now I’d like to work towards cutting the cord a bit. I still want to visit her often, but I can’t spend hours every day. The few days I’ve been around less she’s complained about being bored. Before the move she wasn’t doing anything but watching tv, so this new arrangement isn’t much different. She didn’t really have friends, and her social interactions were just the at home caregivers. At the AL she doesn’t get lots of 1:1 time with the staff, they mostly come on demand or in regular intervals to meet her needs. The AL facility has full days of activities, some which I think she’d like. But she’s never been a joiner, and now in her condition she’s really anxious too.

Any advice on how others here have helped similar family members integrate better into the more general activity structure of the AL facility? In the short term I’m going to accompany her to some events which hopefully she’ll enjoy and then want to do again (although she may not remember!). I was also considering hiring a companion, but that can get real expensive real fast.","One of the hardest things to come to terms with is that we can't make this disease comfortable for our loved ones.  They are losing themselves day by day and it's not a void we can fill.  it hurts and it makes us feel guilty and inadequate but if we spend ourselves trying to prevent it we can end up burning out.
I can't recommend this book highly enough: 

Being Mortal by Atul Gawande examines how important it is that we feel like agents in our own lives, even as age reduces many of our abilities. Basically, allowing our loved ones to find and have a purpose outside of themselves is valuable to improve the quality of their lives.

Caring for plants or animals, or interacting with children or others in need can provide meaning to people as their abilities wane.

But really, everyone in this sub should read this book. Even if I weren't currently managing dad's journey with dementia and old age, this book would be informing my understanding of how to care for people as they become infirm with every single chapter.
Schedule a meeting with the activities director to discuss your Mom's interests relative to what's available. Ask the director to look after your mom, particularly for the first month, and to introduce her to other residents who may share the same interests. Ask her to involve your mom and to remind her of upcoming activities that may she may like.
At the AL place, my MIL was at they had a number of activities and the aids would come around before each activity to see if people wanted to go. We found that if we called right before they were scheduled to come, we could sometimes convince her to go. We would also sometimes emphasize or appeal to an authority that she would listen to. ""Time for the exercise class. Someone will be coming by in a little bit to show you where it is. The doctor said it is really important for your back. The stretching will help the back pain you mentioned the other day.""  We also had some luck using some more directive language. ""Time for lunch with your friends in the dining room. They are waiting for you to join them."" as opposed to asking if she wanted to go to lunch. Implying that there were friends that wanted to see her helped, even though she claimed to be a loner who didn't care about being around people.

Because she didn't remember the schedule or how to get to places, having the aids that would help her find it and to let her know the schedule was essential to getting her places. Or sometimes we would try to time our visits so that we would walk her to the activity and then leave. Or the aid would come to get her and then we would leave. 

And on some level, we just had to let her be bored sometimes. We would say ""You go to the activity that is starting. That might be interesting."" But if she chose not to go, she chose not to go.
Not quite the same, but my mom feel and had to go to ER. She was embarrassed about it, because she could no longer get around as easily. She was spending hours alone in her room. I had a talk with the Resident Care Director and asked for them to put her in a wheel chair and wheel her into the room where everyone sits. The residents mostly sit around and visit with each other. I think the majority of scheduled activities are mainly for marketing.
My mom has never been a joiner, either.  Loved TV time while she did counted cross stitch. Like you, I was trying to get her more involved and unless I started up a conversation with other residents at assisted living, she didn't talk much with others.

I tried.  I suggested clubs, the little volunteer jobs, the exercise class- she wouldn't do it.   She'd only do stuff if I was there.   

Now she's in memory care and completely confused (doesn't know the way back to her room, can't remember the caregivers from day to day).   They have a busy schedule and a lot of fun and music but she will rarely truly participate.  

I think as memory loss progresses, it's harder and harder to participate in anything.  TV isn't even fun for my mother any more- she can't hold onto a storyline for even a 30 minute show.   Reminisce Magazine- once one of her favorite things to look at, is set aside after she glances at a page and asks, ""Who are these people? Do I know them?""

I think we all want the best for our loved ones but dementia is a challenge- participation in activities may be beyond some people's capabilities.   For my mom, just having her sit in the room where people are playing bingo or having a sing along is the best we can do.
Just sign her up for a few.  Whatever you think she might like and don't be afraid to try something new if it looks like fun.  Then you make her a 'daily activities' schedule, just tell her okay this is where you go at such and such a time.  A staff member can come to get her too if she gets mixed up.  If you want to accompany her to one, pick the one that looks the most fun.  That will be the easiest one to quietly leave.  Having a purpose, somewhere you need to be is helpful.
Oh god. I could have written this. 

My mom just moved to AL, and I was there to help her transition and then I had to leave (I live 4 hours away).

And I worried that she'd stick to her anti-social habits and not go out of her way to feel comfortable in her new home. And, I was surprised to learn recently that she has come out of her shell and is getting well integrated. 

As much as she'd rather stay in her apartment and watch TV, she's a nice lady whom people enjoy being around. Although she has anti-social habits, she is very social by nature, and the other residents – the ladies who she sits with at lunch – don't let her away with much. They take good care to bring her a long and include her. 

If your mom can connect with a few people, that might be all it takes for her to shake off some of those anti-social tendencies. I do hope that happens for her AND you.
Wow this sounds exactly like my current situation.   My Dad went into the memory care facility  on March 21st.   By all accounts the first few days were pretty tough on him but he seems to be acclimating a bit better now.   

Our first visit was on the 31st (we stayed away at first as recommended by the facility directors) and my Mom and I have visited every day since for several hours.   Visiting frequently has been helpful in getting to know the staff, but not helpful for his ""social life"".   Dad is a pretty quiet, anti-social type of guy, but at the same time he is scared to death of being left alone.   

We want him to be a part of the community and join in on the activities as much as possible.   But when we visit all he wants to do is watch TV in his room with us.   Leaving to go home at the end of the afternoon has become particularly difficult as he always wants to go with us, even if he doesn't necessarily know who we are or where we are going.   Everyday feels like a new 'abandonment'.  

Yesterday was the first day we haven't visited as we think 'cutting the cord' a bit may be helpful in getting him out of the room more.   We want our visits to be less of a daily scheduled visit, and a bit more random to keep him on his toes and not expect us every day.   

I wish I had more words of advice, but I too am a beginner in the world of memory care.   Just wanted to share my situation and let you know there are others in the same boat.     If you find any helpful tips, send them my way please.",2022-04-07 11:49:07,-emanresUesoohC-,tyfzmz

She is lucid at the moment about 60percent of the time.,"We kept my girlfriends Mom distracted all day with hair and beauty appointments. She left her condo that morning, and we treated the assisted living facility as a surprise when we brought her there in the evening. There's a business in the Fox Valley that was so helpful.

It took a ton of planning and money, but it was successfully done in 1 day.

Dementia,Am I being a jerk with this answer?,"My parents are very strict and devout Catholics. I've had a beard for over a decade and my mother had always hated it.

I was considering getting a tattoo but decided against it. My friend asked why and I said because my mom would yell at me. He thought I was joking but I pointed out that because of her dementia it will be a fresh outrage every time. I don't live with her so each time she sees it will be like the first time, and I don't want to contribute to her mental stress.

My friend thinks I'm being stupid. She's at the point where if I leave the room for 30 minutes she'll ask if I just got there when I come back.","You're being very kind and thoughtful toward a person who is trapped inside themselves and slowly losing the battle. I don't think your friend has ever had to live with or care for someone with dementia. If you still want to get a tattoo now and not wait then maybe one where she won't see it?
You, unlike your friend, understand how type mother operates now. You're kind and considerate for waiting. There will be plenty of time for ink after she's gone if you choose to have some.
I've been hiding a large arm tattoo for 1.5 years and I live with my mom. Get it and adapt as necessary.
I think you are a great son. Considering her sensibilities is incredibly loving, super thoughtful. Of course, you can get one and hide it but, even that, is considerate of her feelings. Or wait until she is gone, and find one that honors her. Either way, you are awesome.
Or cover up the tattoo if possible?
They do make some amazing cover up make up now too. I personally don't have tattoos so don't have experience with them. But I think it's kind that you care not to upset her. I would consider trying to place it somewhere easy to hide with hair, clothing, make up. You deserve to be happy too. You could also apply a temporary tattoo to get her reaction. Dementia can alter personalities so she may not react the same each time. But that might be a good first step without the commitment.
Why would you ask if you're being a jerk for not wanting to aggravate your mother anew each time you see her? I don't think that you're being a jerk. Where would you be considering getting the tattoo, by the way? I guessing some place where you couldn't simply obscure it.
your friend probably doesn't have much experience with dementia. you're doing the right thing. why add stress to your mom. it's not worth it.
My mom hated tattoos... I have a few. She loves to touch a colorful one I have on my arm. It's as if she loves that it is smooth skin yet won't rub off..  lol
I don't understand why your friend cares so much what you do with your body. Why is she trying to control you to such an extreme and then make extremely hurtful ""jokes""?  That sounds incredibly toxic to me.  I wouldn't consider this person a friend at all.
You’re showing respect to your mom which is sweet.
Get that tattoo and you’ll find a way to cover it up or say it’s just a drawing or something. 
Your mom probably wants you to be happy and do what YOU want 
You’re your own person 
Very kind how you consider her though
Get the tattoo. Don’t lose yourself and quit living through someone else’s eyes. You do you.
so funny thing. my mom has dementia. has always been very against me having tattoos. i got one, she is moderate to advanced dementia. she doesnt have the capability of recognizing what a tattoo is. so get the tattoo
If she’s that advanced I doubt she would notice it. It’s time to start living and mothers should love unconditionally. Get the tattoo that you have always wanted and tell it’s temporary if she even notices it.
Your body your choice.
Nope. You are not a jerk. You get it; he doesn't. There may be a time when she won't notice it or even who you are, but it is obviously not that time. When it is, then you can decide if you still want one",2022-04-06 18:50:23,HankPymp,txyiq4

Dementia,"grandfather recently diagnosed, live too far to offer in person support, what else can I do to help?","My grandfather was recently diagnosed, and my grandmother has been doing her best, but is at a loss at the sudden heavy information and work ahead of her. My family is already in action to help, but as a grandchild who lives too far to drive over and help, I feel helpless in how I can minimize these burdens.

He is early in development, he struggles remembering how suspenders work and gets up to dress at 3 am, but he remembers who we are and what year it is still. He is very depressed and anxious though, an understandable feeling for sure. My grandmother is struggling to adapt to all his new needs on top of caring for herself, and my mom is the only one of 3 siblings doing any work to support them. 

Is there items I can buy and send them? Is there advice I can offer? Is it okay to talk about the hard things coming to prepare, or am I overburdening an already exhausted family with more than they are ready for?

Do you have any advice on what I can do?","Are you able to drive over once a month on a weekend and perhaps overnight there to give your grandmother a break? Even a few hours is a great relief!
Something that might help him get a handle on time is a dementia clock. They tell the time and time of day, like ""3:45 in the morning"" or ""5:25 in the evening"" to help them understand. It helped a lot with my mom to be able to get her to go back to bed when she'd wake my brother at 3 in the morning because she was sure she'd just woken up from a nap and it was afternoon. She'd go into his room to scold him for being lazy and sleeping all day. He could point at the dementia clock and she'd just say, ""Oh,"" and go back to bed.
The gift of you time is what is needed.  If I were you I would try to find a way to go see them on a regular basis. You take over his care for a day and give your grandmother a break.  Honestly, being able to have a break once in awhile is a huge deal and can help to ease her stress at least a little it.
Damn that is tragic , how did evolution allow such an error to exist is straight up confusing . Hopefully things go well , and also how did your family discovered that he had Dementia ?

Dementia,Hospital bed and medicare?,"Hello,

Maybe this isn't the right place for this question, but in the past people here have been helpful so I figured I'd give it a try:

My dad has moderate/advanced dementia and it's starting to get the point where he needs to be in a hospital bed. Specifically one that is electric and can be raised and lowered so my mom could take care of him.

I see them online from about $2000 to $3000. I've read that Medicare may cover 80% of the cost? Additionally, we also have Blue shield Blue Cross PPO.

Anyone have experience with this. As far as doctors go, they agree he needs a bed and have written us a prescription. Just trying to figure out the cost aspect. 

Thank You","Medicare Part B does pay for durable medical equipment, the physician and bed provider have to be enrolled in Medicare. You should speak to Medicare directly, they may want you to rent a bed. You could also contact the bed supplier, they would likely know and would probably pre-qualify you through Medicare.
Was your dad a vet? If so, check with the VA as well as with Medicare. You can also look at used ones that may cost less.
He could possibly qualify for hospice depending on how advanced he is. They would provide a bed and medical equipment for him.",2022-04-06 14:52:56,drop-seoi-nage,txtb9y

I miss the person that she was and oh I how I wish I had the times back that I took for granted. The time before her memory left her. Sometimes she tells me that she misses her mother and I tell her that I miss mine too.,"I feel you. I wish this disease came with a warning, something like, ""hey, on October 27, 2022, you're going to have your last real conversation with your parent. If you need any more advice or support, that will be the time to ask. Don't forget to tell them that you love them."" I hate this disease.
  Me too.  My mom was my best friend.  We talked on the phone every day for hours.  I hate this disease.
hugs sent your way and feel the same too with my mom. i just hope i can help preserve the memories she does have for as long as i can. breaks my heart when she forgets who i am....
Sorry you feel this way, I completely understand. Sometimes I look at my dad and it feels like he's so close but yet so far :(
I know exactly what you mean. I feel this so much. I miss my husband so terribly…even though he’s right here. The person in his body is not “him” any more but some other version of him. It’s hard when the person you normally look to for comfort, advice and security can’t fill that role anymore at a time when you need that comfort, advice and security more than ever.
I also care for my mom, and she’s been calling ME ‘mom’ which breaks my heart because it reminds me I don’t have a mom anymore :,(
Oh, I miss my mom too.  Just a few years ago she was my shopping buddy who loved any outing.  A bit confused but happy.

Seeing her today in memory care was so sad.  She’s literally melting away, body and mind.  Her memories were put in a blender- bits of everything and nothing, the dead are living and there’s no understanding she has a great grandchild.  Two days ago she asked me if she had hit someone.  Then she stated, I think I killed someone.  I think I killed a baby.      What a hell for her.

A hug to you-  it is so sad to see our loved ones in such a state that dementia puts them in.
My Mom was so smart and handled so much. All that is just gone. I miss my Mom so much and it’s so hard.
I know this feeling so well. I missed my mom for years before she actually passed. It’s such a terrible feeling. Sending gentle hugs to you. ❤️
Lots of love to you…This is the hardest part…my mom is now in memory care after a year being diagnosed with Parkinson’s. It has been such a trying year. I have cried so many times to my husband, “I never realized I had the last normal conversation with my mom when we had it” 
It’s heartbreaking, you grieve for them, yet they are still alive. It’s horrible. I am so sorry you are going through this.
Less than four years ago my mom and I were taking trips to Europe, New York and Disney world and making plans for more trips to exciting places. We enjoyed each other’s company and had so much fun together. Today she seems like a zombie. She’s frail, weak and confused. We still talk about traveling but I think we both know that’s all in the past.
Not a day goes by I don't wish I could have a chat with both my mum and dad of 2012 again, even just for 15 minutes... So I feel you and it's rough but we cherish the moments they are like their old selves even for a second.
Your mom is exactly like my mom was. My Dad died a year and half before her. She was declining during that and couldn’t remember it. She kind of remembered it a month or two after his death but then I had to tell her he died almost everyday or she thought he left her. It was so hard. She also would cry about missing her parents which was strange to me because she never did that before dementia. I imagine it’s always there but you don’t convey your sadness to anyone as an adult. But she had no ability to filter herself with dementia so she would be sad about them. I guess missing your parents never goes away even when you’re old.
I get it.  My grandfather had dementia.  He was all right when my grandmother died, but four years later my mother died from an aneurysm.  He rapidly declined after that.  At first he thought I was my mother and called me by her name.  I’d have to remember to breathe after every time he did it.  What was worse is I’m a guy.  Then he thought I was his older brother who died right before my mom.  Losing his daughter just broke him.  He passed away almost two year after my mom.  The only bright side was that I was working on our family geneaolgy and was able to ask him questions about family members who died years ago and events, and he recalled those things with an amazing clarity.  So I would just ask him things about his parents, grandparents, and he even told me about dating my grandmother back in the 1930s and how they met when he had a date with my grandmother’s sister.  She had a habit of accepting dates from several guys for the same night and going out with the first one that showed up.  My grandmother answered the door and told him that her sister had gone on a date with someone else and apologized for her sister’s behavior. My grandfather asked my grandmother if she was free that evening and 18 months later they got married.  Grandma passed away two months before their 60th anniversary.
I am sending you all love and hugs. Your compassion for your family members is palpable. Aging is hard. Providing care is hard. Losing the connections from memory loss is devastating.

Dementia,My Dad's newest thing: Obsessing and constantly worrying and constantly reminding you.,"My poor Mom.  She hasn't yet been able to let certain things slide off her back when it comes to my Dad and his dementia.  

Over the course of the last few months.  1.5 years into my Dad's dementia diagnosis, his new thing now is obsessing over things.  Constantly worrying over things like his health or wanting to know test results RIGHT AWAY.   

If my Mom has to schedule a doctor's/specialist appt for him - he will literally wake her up at 7-8am to tell her that she needs to call the doctors office *right then and there* to either follow up on test results, or make follow up appointments.  

Before his illness he was NEVER like this.    Now he needs and wants my mom with him everywhere they go.  

He was getting his teeth cleaned last week and wouldn't let the hygienist clean his teeth unless my mom was in there beside him ""in case he fainted"".  He became obsessed with fainting.  We had him checked out and had his meds reassessed and he's had extensive tests done.  None are coming back to explain his dizziness.  

Is all this part of the disease? The constant obsessing over things? The paranoia?  

He's in the mild to moderate stage.","It's very common. My dad was the same for a long time. I think the confusion and sense of losing control dials up anxiety to 11. During the middle stages of his dementia, for instance, any time my dad had an appointment, he would spend the day before obsessing over it - where was he going, how was he going to get there, when was it, what was it, etc - and then he'd get up at 2-3-4AM and try to get dressed and wake us up insisting we had to go NOW or we'd be late. There was no getting him to understand that he did not, in fact, have to leave the house at 5AM for a 2PM appointment. So we just stopped telling him about them after a certain point. Doesn't sound like your dad is quite at that point, but it's understandable that if he feels like the world is all topsy turvy, he'll want to have his ""security blanket"" and he'll ruminate over all the stuff that's somehow become way more confusing than it really should be.  
One thing that helps with at least some stuff is having it all written down on a whiteboard. Sometimes they obsess because they keep forgetting what's going on and are trying to remember. Having reminders of what they need to do that day all written out can help. Doesn't quite sound that's what your dad is doing - it sounds more like plain anxiety - but it could be a strategy to keep in your back pocket.
Obsessing is a big part of my husband’s MCI. He takes an anxiety medicine to help. He doesn’t think it helps or that he needs it since he doesn’t work anymore so that stress is gone. I say that’s impossible to know unless we take him off the medicine and I’m not in favor of that. Have your mom ask the doctor about putting your dad on an anxiety medicine.
It is very common.  I would tell my grandfather on Monday he had a doctor’s appointment on Thursday.  He would get obsessed and constantly ask the same questions: which doctor am I seeing?  Your regular doctor you’ve seen for years. Where is their office?  Downtown.  Do they know I’m coming?  Yes, you have an appointment.  How am I getting there?  I’m taking you.  Do you know where his office is?  Yes, I’ve taken you before.  It got to the point he would wake up at 3AM and ask me all that.  I finally just started making his appointments for 11AM, and then tell him the day of the appointment he was going. He would also get paranoid about how he was going to pay the doctor.  I told him Medicare will and if there is anything else, I’ll make sure the bill is paid.  “I don’t want you using your money for that!”  Grandpa, you added me to your checking account years ago.  I will write them a check out of your account.  It was easier to hear the endless loop of questions for a few hours than to hear them constantly for four days and nights.",2022-04-06 09:35:38,cp1976,txmc7g

You can also look for a CFP (certified financial planner) in your area that works on hourly cases. A lot of financial advisors are also CFPs but don’t do hourly planning work.

Dementia,Unrecognisable?,"I have been taking photos of him lately... and I don't recognise him.  I really don't.   He has similar facial features and his body shape is roughly the same.  

It's not just photos.  It's the same in real life of course... but I guess it's more... forceful or something... when I see a photo.  When he's 'not-him' his face structure is changed.  I don't recognise him.  His mouth sits differently when he's happy or sad or scared or whatever.   Even his sleeping face is different... how can that be?

Yet, when it's 'him', his face is back to the one I know so well and dearly love.  

Particularly because I'm taking the photo as a memory while he's still here... the photo only reinforces the fact that he's not here at all.

Anyone else feel/see/experience this?  It's all new to me, and this aspect doesn't seem to be talked about?","People with dementia tend to get a slack face, no expressions, they also have a tendency to stare off into space, again with no expressions on their face.  Also called facial masking, sometimes as the disease progresses it becomes more difficult to use the facial muscles , unable to raise eyebrows or smile.  I know there are times I look at my husband and his face is totally slack and he doesn't really look like himself.  He also has times when he looks ""normal"".
Enjoy the window in time when his face is recognizable. Precious windows whether facial or speech let's us know our loved ones are still in there. I cherish these windows like surprise gifts. My mom is in her 10th year of this horrible disease. 💜🎁💜
Yesssss. Omg this struck a nerve so hard.  

My Dad. Sometimes he looks what we like to call ""lost"".  Expressionless.  The gleam in his eye is no longer there.  His eyes look like little small black dots.  Beady.  

Then on good days his facial expressions are livelier. 

He's only moderate decline at this point but we can always tell when the disease rears its ugly head. 

Sending you love and light.  This isn't fun :(
It's normal, unfortunately. My dad was the same. They lose all expression, or their expressions change because they just seem to not be able to control their expressions anymore or respond appropriately to social cues. A lot of the time I just didn't recognize him anymore - all of the characteristic expressions he'd normally use were gone or twisted. He also had this thing where, when he was in one of his psychotic fits, his eyes turned black. Between that and the nastiness/violence, it felt like he was possessed by a demon. All it needed was for his head to start spinning around on his neck.  
So, yeah, I know the feeling. It's just yet another shitty aspect of the disease.
My mom always had a weird set to her jaw when she was in full-on dementia mode and her eyes changed somehow.
Yes.  I see my grandmother (my fathers mother) in my fathers face more than ever.  I never particularly thought he favored her until now.  His eyes have became more sunken into his face and he’s lost weight ( always been a big man) which contributes.  He also has become very child like which blindsided me when I first noticed it because I had forgotten how my father acted when I was a kid.  Like mooing back  at the neighbors cows, stuff like that. He never would have done that as an adult pre-dementia. It has brought back some good memories. Although he can have dramatic meltdowns which are alittle embarrassing since he’s had to move into the nursing facility.  Those can be amusing too.  I’m just like Dad why are you being dramatic and he will stop yelling look at me grin and say “because I can!!”  And continue with the noise as if he never acknowledged I said anything.  Dementia is weird.
You’re used to the tiny things about his facial expressions and stuff that reflect his attitude and personality. When he’s not feeling himself you notice. Because our brains are really good at noticing little things about faces especially familiar ones.",2022-04-06 07:24:55,Dismallest_Pooh,txjx6n

He can only mumble nonsense basically but hardly ever makes a sound despite us trying to talk with him, sleeps all the time constantly. While I am unsure how long this stage lasts, what I can tell you is my uncle has been in this stage for about a little less than a year. I’m new to having to take care of someone with dementia so I don’t have a whole lot of knowledge on this unfortunately but I hope me sharing my experience can offer even slightly helpful information. I too would like to understand the “time frame” because unfortunately it seems like my uncle may not have much longer to go while that terrifies me I still try to remain positive and hope for the best.

Is your loved one on hospice?
It really depends. I've seen or heard of cases of days or a couple of weeks and I've heard of some who sleep almost constantly for several weeks who then wake up and ask for food and get right back into their routine and live for months afterward.
I think it really varies. My grandmother was in this sleeping phase(?) for almost two years. She’d sleep anywhere from 18-20 hrs/day.
I’ve seen it last from a few weeks to years. As long as she is eating she can last a long time. Once they quit eating and drinking they decline a lot faster",2022-04-06 00:54:07,polkadotplants,txeacj
Dementia,Mom needs to get out more - but how?,"Mid-later stage dementia. 75. Living with sister. Sister has two kids and can’t pay much attention to mom. I had mom for over a year but between having 3 jobs, being single and childless, and taking care of my dying stepmom and my dad, I haven’t had time for her. She’s social and she’s bored miserable and depressed. But my sister and I can’t give any more. Are there services for dementia patients? Like someone to come get them and take them on adventures, art classes, etc?","If you have a local Senior Services Division or something similar, they may be able to share information about local agencies. My grandma goes to a Senior Day center. Of course it does cost money. But sometimes local libraries and churches offer senior services.
I'm sorry, I don't have any answers, I'm just commenting because I'm also interested and also on the east coast!
You may want to look into adult day care - they offer optional activities throughout the day for the elderly and usually have medical staff on hand in case help is needed. 

You usually get charged per day and they want you to pick up your loved one before closing time. They won't pick up or drop off, but it can be a regular thing where you drop her off while running errands in the morning.
Are you in the U.S?
Yup! I'm in CT and I had to Google adult day care to find some locally.  You can also ask your health insurance to help assist with finding a place or they might be able to cover it as well.  Goodluck!
Look up Elder Options in your area. Talk to them and see what services they can offer your Mom.
If you're in the US, you probably have a local Agency on Aging.  Give them a call - they have a ton of resources.  I know in our area they have adult day care centers where they can go and do all kinds of activities.  Ours will also provide transportation.

EDIT:  I see you are on the east coast - so yes, there should be a local agency on aging in your area.  They can help with a bunch of stuff...
my grandma used to go to what i called her “day care” during the day when she was still mobile and responding. she lives in a hella rural town so i’m assuming most places have treatment centers like that
Alzheimer’s Association is also a great resource.",2022-04-05 21:12:46,No_Detective_2317,txa9d6
Dementia,Is this common?,"I had to place my 86 year old mother Feb 15 of this year.  The nursing home called today to give me her update after her PCP saw her today. She is prescribing lexapro because mom is exhibiting signs of depression. Mom has a dx of Parkinson’s and dementia. Does this often happen?  Is it the disease or is she just not adjusting well?  I have so much guilt over having to move her out of our home.   I feel so bad for her.   She’s so rarely with it, I  don’t know what to make of this new development.","Depression is very, very common with dementia, as is anxiety. Lots of factors go into it--for many patients, the awareness that their cognition is deteriorating can be very depressing and frightening. For my grandma it was the fact that she didn't remember people would come visit her and care for her. She thought everyone around her had abandoned her, even though people were coming to see her every day. The disease tricks you into thinking you're alone, which can cause depression and anxiety.
I’d be more surprised if there weren’t signs of depression. Losing the very core of who you are is as depressing as it gets.  Don’t be surprised if more medications are added as time goes on
My husband got a prescription for Lexapro to help with anxiety as soon as he was diagnosed with MCI. Not being able to think, remember, and function the way you used to is surely depressing and anxiety-inducing.
I don't think I've never met a dementia patient who wasn't depressed even under the best of circumstances. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
We took this step last week, and the adjustment has been rocky, to say the least.  I am hoping that he will settle in, but not looking good right now.  He was already on some sort of mood stabilizer but I was thinking today that perhaps he needs a med adjustment.
Depression seems to go hand in hand with dementia.  My husband is on 3 antidepressants.
Hang in there if she seems to initially overreact to the meds.  My mom fell and was bed bound and for two weeks it was hell.  She was so depressed and would spend hours crying about how she wanted to die alternating with how she didn't want to die.  Made the decision to medicate (don't recall what) and she was zonked.  Two weeks later she was stabilized and has been the happiest I've seen in a while.
My dad was just put on lexapro as well. During his screening he scored high for anxiety and depression (this is the same appointment where the doctors said he has MCI, his neurology referral isn’t until the summer).
I felt the same way. Thankfully when’s the meds kicked in she’s happier than I’ve seen her in a long time. Best of luck
Thanks guys. I’m an only child and trying to manage it all as best I can.  I’m sorry we are all here.
Update:  the last week of visits have been pretty amazing, all things considered. What she’s saying doesn’t make much sense, but at least I am able to get her to engage.   Thanks everyone.   Sorry we are all here.",2022-04-05 19:51:05,Sargeswife1983,tx8obx
Dementia,How to keep your own blood pressure down and stay healthy,"Since Ive become a caregiver for my dad, his health has only improved.  But ive gained 20 lbs, ive had to raise my blood pressure medication, and im prediabetic.

The issue for me isnt actually the amount of work.  Its his personality.  I cant stand it.  Hes so sexist, doesnt go a day without insulting me, and complains about my sisters all the time even though all of us bend over backward for him.  If i could only tell myself its the dementia talking.  But no, this is truly him, just more often cause he forgot he already said those things and repeats them.

How can i keep my blood pressure down and keep his words from draining me of my energy to do things like exercise.","My grandmother was very generous, with her money, her time, and her opinions. She was born in 1901 and she had very definite ideas abut what everyone should do. She told us she loved us, made delicious meals, bought wonderful gifts, and criticized our hair, clothes, weight, grades, speech, friends, pets, you name it.  It only got worse as she got older, and as dementia set in, what little filter she had disappeared.

She started to say awful things out loud to us, about us, and about other people.  I started responding by saying ""Grandma, that's a horrible thing to say,"" in a quiet, sweet voice.  That would kind of catch her, and instead of continuing to rant, she'd stop and try to come up with a defense or excuse.  So I'd say, ""that doesn't make a difference, it's still not right.""  The trick was, I didn't argue the merits of what she said and I didn't internalize it.  I just told her it was bad.

My sister never could do that. Grandma would make a crack about sister's boyfriend (""How can he be Catholic?  I thought he was supposed to be smart"") and sister would try to explain why Grandma was wrong on the merits. Sister would get more flustered and more upset, Grandma would dig in, and it would only end when sister went off in tears.

Don't argue with him but don't accept what he says, either. Just tell him ""that's mean"" or ""what an awful thing to say,"" but don't raise your voice, don't argue the point, and don't take it personally.  If you don't take the bait, you win.
Can you go for daily walks? Exercise can help, even just 10 minutes a day. Reduce red meat, drink lots of water, and get the Calm app on your phone. I cut all processed food and added more veggies to every meal, walk a few minutes every day, and got my pressure to normal.
Can you frame it so that you see him as a character in a movie or just some nasty old man running his mouth? Or imagine he is speaking gibberish? Basically, can you change your perspective so it is no longer personal, but just see him as a stranger that you’re taking care of and NOT your father?

There is also the thought of literally just not listening to him. Pretend his voice is just a loud tv in another room that is just making noise? 

Those are my suggestions. Attempt to disconnect. His words have no value, it is just a stink in the air.

Hugs to you, I hope you find relief.
I will say I’m so sorry. I’ve been dealing with my dementia father for about 4 years now. Meditate meditate and meditate. Also - I know this doesn’t help - but try and ignore him the best you can, when it comes to his comments. They say, people that take care of dementia patients often acquire dementia traits during and after, cause their mind is going but ours is not, so our minds don’t know how to process the situation. Have you considered putting him into memory care? My father is just like yours, very sexist and rude. So my fear was that no one else can handle him besides me. That is not the case! Please believe me. Once I put him into memory care, I felt like I could breathe again. I’m praying for you. Also - this channel is great just to vent sometimes. Good luck ♥️
i reaized today that i’m “working” at a “job” which has a toxic “work” environment, that under normal circumstances at a normal
job i would try to leave as soon as possible.  but this is somehow different, and i can’t seem to get out of the job. and that sucks. it’s exhausting, the horrible life perspective and negative views, just constantly, without hope for change.
Have CBD gummies from a reputable brand and don't forget to take time for yourself everyday.

Dementia,Taxes???,"Uggggh. So we're getting Durable POA for my dad today. His wife died last week and I'm just now realizing I probably have to file taxes for him/them. She had no income whatsoever so maybe that'll be easy. But my dad has Social Security and VA benefits and held a job briefly last year for like 2 weeks. I really want to do it on TurboTax but I get the feeling I'll need a tax preparer or something like that. IF anyone has any experience with this, even just pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. 

What a mess.","Sounds too complicated for TurboTax or one of the online preparation services if they would even let you sign on his behalf. 😕
I use TaxAct, and the program asks you up front what changes were made to the household last year, including a death; these programs are usually are pretty intuitive. If you wanted piece of mind, you could always get the ""protection"" plan they all offer that, if you are audited, they will get involved. Best of luck, and I'm very sorry for your family's loss.
I think Turbo Tax should handle the situation you described just fine (bookkeeper, here), per their help files:

I use H&R Block's tax software, and it can handle the situation. Good luck! This is the first year of my mother's dementia was bad enough that I needed to do her taxes, and she moved states last year, so I had to file three returns for her. Thankfully it is done!
Who did his taxes last year?  That would be my 1st go to. If he did them on Turbotax, you should be able to pull them up on his computer and get a head start onthis years",2022-04-05 11:38:58,DrinkableReno,twxscp
Dementia,Questions Needed for Interview,"Hi everyone, 

This Thursday, I will sit down to do an interview with Dr. Cameron Camp, who is an expert in non-medical approaches to dementia care. Instead of creating questions of my own, I am hoping to collect some questions from you all to ask Dr. Camp, and I would tremendously appreciate your input. 

What are some of the biggest challenges you are facing that you would like insight on? What do you not understand about dementia? What questions do you have about long-term care? Anything else you'd like to ask? 

I'll select questions among the most upvoted and upload the video here after it is complete. 

Thanks!! 

&#x200B;

Here is Dr. Camp's bio: 

""With over three decades of dedication to the applied and translational research of gerontology, dementia intervention, and cognitive intervention, Dr. Camp has earned international renown for his work to improve the quality of life for persons with dementia and memory disorders.

The co-holder of two patents developed through Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR), Dr. Camp has also been appointed Principal Investigator on numerous NIH-funded projects and served as President of the Adult Development and Aging division of the American Psychological Association.

Lecturing and training across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America on the use of Montessori Dementia Interventions – and with writings that have been translated into six other languages – Dr. Camp is a personal force for global change for persons with dementia and memory disorders.""",,2022-04-05 11:04:15,Chemical_Object2540,twx14z

Dementia,Virtual Support Group for Dementia Family Caregivers,,"You have entered into a journey that is one way, The patient will not magically wake up and be all better again. Caring for someone with dementia, disabilities IS a burden. Just as well go ahead and admit it, be honest with yourself, and then go forward. The patient can be very difficult, not accepting that they have limited and decreasing abilities. There isn't anything one can do but take each day as it comes. You have a LOT of company in this struggle. It feels like you are alone, but you aren't. If you are able, try to share the burden with others. That way you get a very badly needed and well deserved breather from the unceasing burden. When you have a moment to yourself, take it. Try to find opportunities to disengage, even for a few minutes. It'll help you to catch your breath and re-energize. You are doing the best you can. There is no ideal situation. Even professional caregivers get tired, worn, burned out. Allow yourself to be imperfect. You'll make it through this journey. All you have to do is make it through the next hour. After that, just make it through another hour.

Dementia,My aunt with dementia…,"Hi everyone! We just sent my aunt who is 86 years old to a senior living care facility because her sundowning was getting severe and it was beginning to be too much for my mother to handle.

After she settled in at the facility my brother and I came down from out of town to visit her. They let her sleep over my parents house so we could all spend time. Everything was perfectly fine. She was super happy to hang out with us and spend time with my daughter, but after we dropped her off she became very disoriented in the following days and her sundowning became a lot worse.

I know she misses us and we miss her as well, but the owner of the facility told my mom that it probably wasn’t a good idea that we took her out for that weekend because she just got lonelier afterwards. They advised us not to call or pick up her calls and to limit her visits once a month. 

I am all for doing anything to make my aunt as comfortable as she can be, but It really doesn’t sit well with me that she is at a facility by herself and we can’t even talk to her. I don’t want her to think we left her and neglected her. She practically raised me, my brother and my cousins and it doesn’t feel right in my heart to do what the facility tells us.

My question to anyone who has experienced this: Is what they’re saying the right thing to do? Will it make it worse for my aunt if we contacted and visited her more because it will just make her lonelier? If it does then I have no problem backing off like they’re asking. Sorry if this post was too long!

TLDR; My aunt’s sundowning got worse after we visited. Facility told us to stop contacting her and only visit once a month. Wondering if that’s the right thing to do.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your responses. It definitely gave me the affirmation I needed. I called my aunt this morning and she was so happy to talk! I’ll encourage the rest of the family to do the same. I appreciate you all!","Visiting as long as you are fitting into her new routine should be manageable. 

Perhaps Arrive at meal time and sit with her. I suggest you avoid nap times, bath times, group activities or therapy times so she doesn’t deviate too much from her scheduled routine.

Make your visit short and intentional. You can leave and return the same day if needed. Keep your visit calm, don’t bring along a lot of distractions like pets or active children.
Please do not stop visiting her! I can't understand why they'd tell you to limit your visits and phone calls with her. It may be too much for her to bear to go home to visit but they shouldn't tell you to limit your visits to her at all.
People with dementia do that anyway whether family visits or not. She will be so much more lonely if you all only visit once a month.
You should not have taken her for the weekend. Changes in location and routine are very detrimental to people with dementia. The disorientation afterwards is an expected fallout. However, restricting visitation and contact afterwards will only make the matter worse. Keep in contact with her and visit when it doesn’t disturb things like naps, group activities or showering, etc. when speaking with her, try to console her and drive it into her brain that the facility is her home, not with you. Be as kind and gentle about it as possible, but she now thinks home is with you and doesn’t feel secure in the facility anymore, which is a problem for her dementia and acting out. In her brain she has been removed from her home and safe place and abandoned at a foreign place with no family and strange people. Ignoring her will likely make her panic, lonely and emotionally unstable.
My dad entered memory care a week ago.  He is in a very nice, brand new facility and he was able to bring his golden retriever.  However, he is completely disoriented and upset and confused.  So far, either/both my sister and I have visited him every day.  Some visits are fine, he is relatively calm and happy to see us.  Other times, he is angry and aggressive and paranoid.  It is heart wrenching.  He asks to go home and we mostly redirect.  Having his dog is a blessing - I don’t know what we’ll do when the dog is gone (he’s pretty old) - but also, he is the first and  only dog in the facility and we want to make sure he is being well cared for.  I couldn’t leave my dad there wondering where his loved ones are, even if he acts like a jerk some of the time.  I have no doubt that the caretakers might prefer we don’t come as often but, for now, it’ll be a daily thing.

However, I don’t think it would be a good idea for us to take him home even for a short visit (we’re only 10 minutes away).  As crushing as it is to leave him there and deny his pleas, I think it would be cruel to take him home and then away again.  But there is no way I would not visit as often as possible.

I’ve heard that the caregivers are somewhat more attentive when they know that family members will be there frequently.
My mother (89 yo), has late stage dementia. I find the once a month visitation request to be questionable, however I agree, to take her out for an evening away with family was unwise and terribly disruptive to your aunt's needs. Continuity is the key, routine is not helpful, it's crucial to dementia patients.
It is quite an adjustment, for both the patient and the family.
I do not think their advice is fair. While checking her out overnight is probably too much for her nowadays and it reminds her of all the seasons lost and she probably is more Lonesome afterwards. It would be way better for you to visit her in the facility. But they cut her off to only once a month is inhumane and she needs to know that y'all love her. Waiting a month to see you would be awful for her and she would feel abandoned which would only lead to more depression.
Being told not to visit or call is BULL! A possible red flag!",2022-04-05 02:32:42,jbern17,twoj20
Dementia,When do I say something ? Should I?,"So I have a good friend who is older, just turned 70 actually. I work actually work a lot with people with dementia so it's pretty normalized to me and 70 doesn't seem that old to me either. Anyway, I've been noticing my friend bring up the same things a lot. We talk a lot about spirituality (buddhist) and we both read a lot, so we end up sharing a lot on the stuff we read and such. But over the last several months he has mentioned and sent me emails (at least 2) about an natural art thing he once saw in Spain. I don't think he realized at all how many times he has told me about it, shown me pictures, sent me stuff on the web. etc. The same is true for a couple other things--one is a Ted talk about a book he likes. He must have sent me the Ted talk three times now and mentioned the book every time we talk. I saw him recently and he once again sent me a link to the Ted talk. 

Should I tell him he's sent these things before? He has some health issues which may be effecting his memory slowly and there's not much he can do about it. I feel like if I tell him he will just worry about something he can't change. It's also not that dramatic--like this is pretty small stuff to be forgetting too.","I tell my husband when he sends me multiple things or repeats himself that I appreciate his sending it AGAIN, as I could have missed it in my email, text
Messages, etc. 

This is a non-threatening way to let him know. If he continues to repeat it, I stop to talk about the topic so we can close the loop. I feel he is trying to keep it in the forefront of his mind for fear he may forget it himself. My husband will
Focus intently on a topic, but when we flesh it out a bit together, he lets it go quicker.

This works for us.
There's no harm in mentioning that they sent it to you before, and you enjoyed reading it. They know something is going on. They know they aren't remembering things.

Depending on how close you are to them, you can suggest when they go in for their checkup with their doctor, that they ask the doc to do a memory evaluation. There is a LOT that can be done, if it is caught early, to help slow the decline.

Early detection is important. So if you really like this person, help push them in the direction they already know they need to go. They aren't just forgetting things with you... other people have noticed and mentioned it too.",2022-04-05 00:57:39,ilovecatscatsloveme,twn2rp
Dementia,Thank you for all your posts,"I just got here. I've been dealing with my mum's advancing dementia for years now--with a major increase since the start of the pandemic--but I found this sub only today. My mother is 82 years old, and, to judge by the guides and charts and things that I see online, she's in either late sixth or early seventh stage dementia. This time a year ago, she was hostile and angry a lot of the time; blamed me for most of everything, mostly about where she was. That's pretty well passed, I'm happy to say, and now she's a lot quieter. She's tired most of the time and won't last more than an hour or so at a visit. I'm luckier than some here in that I'm not a full-time caregiver. My wife and I are the only ones local to my mum, so we make all the visits--at least half of which are generally spent changing her and getting her cleaned up. Unfortunately, my mum isn't in a top-flight facility because she didn't save a whole lot of retirement money, and the U.S. is a pretty terrible place to be old and not have your wits fully about you. We do what we can, and the staff is nice and caring, but they're just too few. I've got one sibling who is out of state and pretty much stopped visiting when my mum started going downhill. It's been almost four years since she visited. I think she just can't handle it.

Anyway, I originally came here to ask about how you all speak or interact with a parent who is almost unable to speak or interact in any meaningful way, anymore. I've found one thing to do is to read to my mum. She was always an avid reader, throughout her whole life, but she's pretty well stopped now, and her attention span and comprehension are poor now. The other day, I pulled an old book off my shelf that I knew she loved as a child--""The House at Pooh Corner"" by A.A. Milne. I've been reading it to her, and she seems to like it. (I do the voices.) I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for other ways to interact/things to read because we're nearing the end of the book. I'll confess I feel a little lost as to how to deal with it all. 

Anyway, thanks to everyone for writing your posts here and sharing your experiences, your frustrations, your fears, your anxiety, and everything else. It honestly helps to know that there are others on the same journey.","Welcome! You are definitely not alone, and it sounds like you have some valuable experience to share with us. My dad is not quite as advanced as your mom but when I find something that works, I just repeat it until it doesn't work anymore. He seems to like familiarity or maybe it's just that he doesn't remember the last time. So in the case of the book you're reading to her, I think I would just try reading it again. She might enjoy it just as much.

If possible, take your loved one outdoors too, even just a folding chair in the driveway (with shade). Nature has a way of resetting and/or calming mood. May also make for better rest when napping too.
Hi! I’m pretty new here and have found it to be such an incredible source of support, advice and recommendations (the book The 36-Hour Day and the ´dementia’ clocks that show time + date + time of day in big characters have been particularly helpful). 
My MIL has pretty advanced dementia (still working on the formal diagnosis) and caring for her has been exhausting and heartbreaking and overwhelming and humbling. I, too, feel so so grateful for this community. 
Coming back to your mom - the childhood books idea is a great one. Perhaps you could try Peter Rabbit or The Wizard of Oz. Or read select articles from the local news. And yes, you can always reread The House at Pooh Corner.
My MIL also enjoys listening and swaying to music, so I put out a little bluetooth speaker and play from my phone (Sinatra and Brubeck tunes are favorites). Sometimes I add a little commentary before a song.
Depending on her mood, she sometimes enjoys looking at old family photographs. 
Also, she likes when I massage her hands with lavender scented lotion. 
One other thought is (if her diet allows and she would enjoy) is to bring her a little edible treat when you visit. You can talk about where you got it/why you brought it for her to make conversation, and she’ll have a pleasurable non-verbal experience. 

Hang in there & remember to give yourself (and your wife) a lot of grace. This is… a lot.
I don't really have much to offer that hasn't been said (music is the one thing I would have offered up, esp if your mum was into music at all) but I feel the same about this sub. I'm not at a place where I can be super helpful yet, as I'm really just starting to learn for myself, but the resources here have been great even in lurk mode, and agreed that just not feeling so alone in the struggle helps somehow. I'm an only child dealing with this, and it sounds like you might as well be in this case. It's hard to feel like you're the only person that can do anything even if you don't have her at home. Some help would definitely be nice. 

You seem like a wonderfully caring child with patience and grace though - ngl I teared up a little at the ""I do the voices"" aside, bc that's such a lovely detail. Your mum may not realize it now, **but you're doing a great job**.  

I'm so sorry for the conditions where your mum is; you're totally right that the US is a terrible place to be old or infirm in any capacity. Not sure if this will make you feel better or not, but I can tell you that even in the more expensive facilities it's not that much better to be honest. Understaffing is still a constant issue that disrupts their ability to offer the kind of care they should be doing. My mom is in the best location in her area that we can find (they have some money they came into not too long ago that will be gone before too much longer probably, but we'll spend it all if we have to), and I have the same issue with the fact that the people that do work there are kind and caring and lovely, but pressing the nurse button often means waiting 20 minutes or more because there just aren't enough people, which is just... awful to me, especially when it means my mom needs to be cleaned up rather than helped to the toilet. 

But it's still better than the level of care that I or my 83 year old stepdad could provide at home in a very real way, so it is what it is.",2022-04-04 23:40:05,Oso_Furioso,twlq7w
Dementia,He said Thank you.,Here lately my uncle has been declining fairly quick it seems and refusing me at every moment I try to help. Every day he changes for the worst which I know is to be expected and my heart breaks to watch him struggle even to talk to him is impossible since he makes no sense all the time. No one should have to suffer like this its freaking awful. Anyway on to the good. Today he finally allowed me to help him change his clothes and clean him with a warm damp cloth which he has been aggressively adamant against this whole week and for once he was able to say thank you for all that you do for me. I was flabbergasted that he had a moment of clarity to thank me! I almost cried at being so happy to help him and him realize this for a wonderful moment in time. I know tomorrow will be different but I just wanted to share this win with those of you who know what its like to go to battle with dementia every single day. So here's to all you exhausted and burned out caregivers I wish all of you the best while enduring this Hell with our loved ones. Thank you❤,"Thanks so much for sharing that!
A beautiful ""window"" of clarity ❤
So happy to hear that he said that to you and appreciate you sharing!",2022-04-04 19:03:15,carolinabluebird,twfwmv
Dementia,advice on long-haul flights,"My (24f)  mother (57f) has ftd, fairly advanced, but she can still speak - forming mostly decent sentences with real words, although it often doesn't make much sense as she has lost most nouns, and has no object recognition, and her understanding is pretty limited. She also doesn't know she has anything wrong with her, and is very stubborn, and doesn't like being told what to do unless by someone she views as an authority (e.g. doctors). She is also very mobile, and she is very reluctant to deviate from her routines, and has a preference for her own agenda. She has recently had two bouts of fecal incontinence due to not understanding the urgency of getting to the toilet. 

I'm sure people in this thread will understand more than most, but it can be tricky to take her places. Of course, we manage fine on short trips like day trips etc., but we are flying to Australia (from the uk) very soon, as our family lives there, and we want to take her over there for what we assume will be the last time. It's a 7 hour flight, and then a 14 hour flight, and then obviously a very different routine when we get there. She doesn't really like going out much and socialising, as she gets very anxious when she doesn't know what's going to happen, when we are going home etc. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for the flights, and for how we help her cope while we are there. We have accepted it's not likely to be the easiest trip in the world, but we would like to be able to have a nice time as a family, and for mum to enjoy herself. Thanks in advance!","Wow, that’s a tough one.  I hate to say it, and it is not what you asked, but I would possibly rethink this.  It sounds like a total nightmare for her (and you and probably most everyone else) and it may even accelerate her decline.  Does her doctor have an opinion?  Is it at all possible for the Aussie relatives to come to you?    

Both my dad and my aunt are in similar shape as you mother, more or less.  For my aunt, going anywhere provokes quite a lot of anxiety and obsessive worrying.  For my dad, the noise coupled with the unfamiliarity of a different environment sends him into either a rage or a mumbling trance.  I could not imagine such a journey for them.  But, you didn’t ask that.  Does she wear adult diapers?  I would think you would want to do that at a minimum.  (However, my dad resisted that enormously).  

I wish you the best of luck.  You are a wonderful daughter to be considering how to connect her to loved ones.
i’m sorry but this sounds like a terrible idea. a 7 hour then 14 hour flight for someone with advanced dementia? and incontinence? what if she panics while up in the sky? what if she had an accident and now everyone is forced to smell it and her to sit in it the rest of the flight? how can someone fit in the tiny bathroom to help her change into clean pants? would she be okay with wearing a mask that long if needed? it’s borderline cruel to put someone with advanced dementia through this. 

you say she gets anxious when she doesn’t know what’s going on. do you think traveling to the airport, going through security, waiting to board, getting on the flight, and all that to land in a place she’s never been to or hasn’t been to in a while will make her anxious? 

is there any way your family can come to you all and visit? 

it would be great if she would go and all went well but im not quite sure if that is a realistic outcome.

my mom was very advanced when i was your age and still in her 50s so i truly understand. as someone who has gone through all this i really think this is an awful idea and i hope you all reconsider. 

problems like this are why dementia is so so difficult for the entire family.
First off, talk to her about the trip. Does she want to go? If she doesn't really want to go, nothing you can do to make it happen easily or go well. What are her expectations for each part of the trip? Talk through what to bring, getting to the airport, flights, each part. She might tell you things you can address before you go.

You can perhaps ask a doctor for some kind of very mild sedative? My sister had our doctor prescribe something for our mother in case she became agitated when we moved her from the US to Mexico. We ended up not using it. Another idea is Benadryl: it is very safe and can have a sedative effect (but it can also go the opposite way: whatever you decide medicine-wise test it out on a calm day beforehand).

Talking about the trip, making a checklist for sections of the trip to go over, having photos of the places you will go and the people you will see, will help manage expectations and keep her oriented.

You could have a 'doctor's letter' that outlines the most important things: that she needs to wear adult diapers because airport bathrooms are a fall risk, that she needs to take pre-flight medication because of less oxygen on the plane, etc.

I put on adult disposable diapers and showed her the waistband over my trousers. I very strongly encouraged my mother to do the same before our trip. I told her the bathrooms were out of service on my last flight and I didn't want to deal with it again. That's what it took to get her to wear them so that's what I did. I also brought a change of clothes, and made sure she went to the restroom before our flight (4 hour flight for us). We broke up our 3 flights over two days. The longest flight I had her in first class, which was definitely worth it for keeping her physically comfortable (I was lucky that she paid for her own flights).

I (49f) recently took my mother (dementia, 77f)  on a weeklong family vacation to the seaside: apart from a couple of hard days she loved it. She loved spending time with the people who went with us, she loved the food, had a blast. She doesn't always know who I am, but I could at least give her a nice vacation. One young woman who went with us was the designated care-giver for the times she refused to participate in vacation activities. The worst thing that happened was that she refused to release her baby turtle to the ocean and it took a lot of convincing to make her let go of his bowl, haha!

People will tell you it's going to be difficult, and it is, but if you think she will enjoy it and you are willing to do the hard stuff, go for it.
1. I wouldn't do it even though my husband is not that advanced in the disease.  I know that taking him on short vacations is very confusing and disorienting to him. The thought of him on a plane for 7 hours and then 14 hours, no, no, no.  Please think about this.  She will be trapped on the plane and forced to sit in a seat for hours.  She is already fecal incontinent.  What will you do if that happens on the plane and she refuses to be changed? Think of trying to change her in an airplane bathroom. The possibility for everything to go wrong and this being harmful to her is such a risk.  Your idea that it will be a wonderful time after you get there is kind of a pie in the sky ideal.  I know this is not what you asked but I just don't see how you can reasonably accomplish what you want.  I feel this will be so hard on her and you may see her progress in her disease due to taking her on such a long and grueling (for her) trip.  You love her, you mean well, you want her to see the relatives for probably the last time.  Understandable, but think of the cost to her.
I don’t have a solution but wanted to share that we are in somewhat the same position. My dad is 85 with Alzheimer’s. He is from Ireland (moved to the states in his 30s) and talks about going back all the time. Sometimes he thinks he’s in the Republic and just needs to cross the border to his hometown. 

We’ve planned and canceled trips twice - once just before his diagnosis for a low sodium issue, and then at the start of the pandemic. We are weighing whether this trip home for him is still something we can do. 

Disease-wise, we might be in an okay place. He’s much less agitated than he was a few months ago, and hasn’t advanced to the point of not handling his own personal care tasks. His job used to be in travel, and there is a routine for visiting family that we can stick to as closely as possible. If we do plan this trip it will be as soon as a possible and we might get business class tickets for my parents for the overseas flight to increase their comfort level as much as possible. (I think he will get a kick out of this too, since it will be like his old travel days.)

Even so - we aren’t sure if this is all worth it. The time change is going to be incredibly difficult. Our family over there will need to be very aware of his condition and willing to help in any way. Even though he wants to go, he might be expecting to see the Ireland of his childhood, or his long-dead parents, or any number of things that will be difficult or upsetting when they are different than he wants them to be. It’s also doubtful that he will even remember going after we get home - so considering his level of comfort and enjoyment on the trip itself is our main concern. We do want his family to be able to see him one last time, but I’m not sure that outweighs what’s best for him. 

This is all to say, I relate and I hope your family is able to figure out a solution!
My dad has FTD, and when I read your post I just thought,what a nightmare. When I moved him up with me it was a 1600 km drive. We took 3 days to do it, and it was totally grueling and disorienting for him, and really miserable for me. And it accelerated his decline greatly. I thought maybe he would come back a little but he never did. 

But if you are absolutely going to do this, you really have got to get her and at least one family member into first class. And for the return flight also. Not sure about your mom but my dad is a sugaraholic it's one of the symptoms and he's got it really bad. Sometimes if I really have to keep him under control I keep a steady stream of sugary snacks coming his way. I include a mix of his favorites and new things he's never had but that I know he'll like. This keeps him distracted from what's going on and interested in the food instead of stressing about every tiny detail.

Strongly recommend Qantas. Even economy class is good. But first class is incredible. Hoping for the best for you let us know how it goes!
My heart goes out to you!

I Had a rough time flying my mom (mid stage dementia) cross country in the US. 


Before the flight I loaded up her iPad with her favorite shows she spends all day watching at home, and did some demo runs with a bunch of different earphones that she was ok with. Once in the air, she couldn’t deal with the earphones so she was basically left with nothing to do. She spent most of the flight talking with me (exhausting) or fretting over turbulence, etc… We divided it up into two 4h flights with a night at a hotel in between. We definitely wouldn’t have made it back to back. I can’t imagine a 14h flight. :(

Also consider things like toilet. She had to go to the bathroom on one of the flights and that involved cordoning off the first class vathroom area with a curtain so we could keep the door open and help her in/out/clean.

Lastly there’s the mask issue. Is she able to wear a mask for 14h? I came to the flights with a doctor’s note warning she may not be able to keep the mask on. Thankfully she kept it on. Otherwise I’d be stressed about her getting COVID.
I do not recommend taking flights.  It may decline her health more aggressively.  My personal experience, my mother would be very anxious whenever in dark movie theaters or stuffed into a small area with alot of people. She felt like people were staring at her. If possible, do a car trip and do not take the interstate but rather a more scenic relaxing route. My mother loved the scenery and would just talk about anything. 

Hope this helps!
Absolutely do not ever take her on a flight. She will get panicked and it’ll end poorly. Please rethink this. Distress like this can actually cause faster progression.",2022-04-04 18:41:21,lilactoes,twfc64

Dementia,Mushrooms for Alzheimer’s/Dementia?,"Hi all,

My grandmother was just diagnosed with Alzheimer’s (after displaying symptoms for a few months). Obviously we are doing whatever the doctors recommend, but I’ve heard a few people talk about mushroom supplements for dementia. 

I don’t know specifically what mushroom supplements to look for and I wanted advice. I know it’s not a cure- but I was wondering if anyone knew what to look for or had any other suggestions for helpful supplements?","Lion’s Mane is the mushroom.  You can get it in capsule form (also powder but it tastes horrible).  My Dad’s neurologist recommended it.  I started taking it myself - I figured it can’t hurt!
There is *some* small study research that says lion’s mane can help with cognitive decline, but it may be more preventative than something that helps after symptoms have developed. I’d be curious to hear anyone else’s experience!
Look into the benefits of microdosing.",2022-04-04 16:47:00,The29thpi,twcllv

Dementia,First fall at our house,"What an honestly awful night/morning for everyone in my house! We have a ranch house so falling never happens. It was 5am he was calling my name for I don’t know how long, I was dead asleep. I asked him what was wrong. His glasses of course, one of his lenses fell out. As it was still dark out and he had no reason to use them for sleeping I said can you wait till morning. He walked back to the living room where his lift chair is. Not long after I heard what sounded like a door slam. I listened for awhile but nothing out of the usual. Until 6:30am groaning sounds started, I told my mom and there he was laying on the bathroom floor. (He weighs just as much as I do and he’s taller, so I can’t lift him up) finally came my dad and he helped him up. Grandpa had stood in the bathroom for only who knows how long and collapsed. He obviously doesn’t remember what he was doing or why he was in there for so long. 

I feel like he’s been declining quickly the past few months. But he never got officially diagnosed. The doctor just said “He’s got some dementia”. So all in all we don’t even know where he’s at on the stages. Sigh. Unfortunately I think the next step is a home.","Lack of sleep for caregivers and/or broken sleep takes a heavy toll on a person. Moms been in memory care for about 3 months now and I still have a hard time sleeping through the night. It’s the most thankless and exhausting job in the wooed caring for a loved one with this retched disease. Bless you and take care of yourselves.
I am so sorry!  I have been through this twice with people I care for.  I believe you are right, there comes a time when you cannot physically as well as emotionally do this on your own.

Dementia,Mother's dementia and financial decisions/control.,"My mom's dementia isn't bad and she can manage many things on her own. She has problems with paying bills and my sister and I can do this. However, getting control of anything is like pulling teeth. A year ago she would insist that one of use come to her place and she would get out her checkbook, etc. It took forever. Now we are (mostly) online. 

I expect the dementia to get much worse and I want that my sister and I have more control over her money and finances. We have done a lot like frozen her credit and we both have power of attorney (although she can certainly make her own decisions at this point). How do other people do this or manage this? My sister ends up taking care of so many other things at my mom's place. (Tv doesn't work right, etc) and I would prefer she focus on things like this. (I am in another state and make phone calls and such.) 

My mom told my sister it is her ""job"" to take care of her and I so I want my mom to understand that we need to be able to help her. Just now I asked the HOA to remove my dad's name from the bills and I need my mom to call and she won't do it. There are so many minor annoying things and I really expect this to get much worse.","A question for you:  Is the power of attorney a ""springing"" one, meaning it comes into effect only given certain conditions, or is it a general power that is effective from the moment it is signed? You should be able to tell from the text. If it is in effect without further action, the HOA should be able to take your word for it, if you provide them with a copy of the document.
You need to have her add you to her checking account if you can.  I pay all my mom’s bills through bill pay with her bank.  I also have her POA.
One thing I did with my grandfather (I had his power of attorney) was call the utilities and ask if I could set up the bills on an automatic draft every month.  My grandfather had gotten to the point that if he got the mail, he would either hide it somewhere because the bills were something important and he didn’t want to lose them or he would put them in a stack on the table next to his chair.  I was also a co-signer on his checking account, so I also ended up just taking his checkbook away because before he got really bad, he would get his bank statement and panic because he couldn’t get it to balance.  It was because he was writing checks for bills and not writing them down and thought someone was stealing his money.  I would sit down with him and go over it and say things like “this amount looks like the power company, you just forgot to write it down.” That seemed to calm him down.  Anyway, if you are comfortable with it, see if you can get monthly bills set up on an auto draft.",2022-04-04 12:32:36,pm_toss,tw6cx4
Dementia,My father is displaying early signs of Alzheimer's and is refusing to see a doctor,"My father (M, 70) has been confined to a wheelchair for about 15 years, and is reliant on help for even getting out of bed and going out and about. My mother (F, 61) is there to assist him, and we are lucky to be able to afford carers who tend to him. Recently, over the last few years, he has become noticably forgetful - from both small things, such as what day it is, what he had for lunch, or what time someone is supposed to come over, to other more things such as my brother's birthday, his cousin's name, whether people are dead or alive, etc. Sometimes he will ask the same question 2 or 3 times during lunch or dinner, not realising that we have spoken about it already barely 5-10 minutes earlier. It has reached the stage where it is noticable even to people who don't live with him, but are meeting him socially.

The problem is - he is refusing to acknowledge these things happening. He either tries to laugh it off, claiming he was fooling us (he wasn't), or gets verbally combative, saying we're trying to trick him into thinking he's going mad. In one instance, even when on text message he mentioned something unfathomable, and we tried to show it to him as 'proof', asking him what he was trying to say, he just shuts up and shuts everyone else out. In his opinion, everything is as it should be.

But it is clearly not. Looking at early symptoms of Alzheimer's, he is displaying a number of them: forgeting about recent conversations or events; forgeting the names of places and objects; asking questions repetitively; becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things.

But he refuses to see a doctor. We have tried speaking kindly, politely, begging, cajoling, pleading, being harsh, being reasonable - to no avail. He is convinced that we ""want to make him think he is mad"".

I really am not sure how I even proceed with this - I do not live in the same city as my parents, and I know that my mother is quite anxious about what the future holds. In her opinion, even if we just know what is happening, either way, at least it makes it easier to deal with - if a diagnosis can be confirmed, wouldn't it be better to start treating with medicines as early as possible? And if he is being this stubborn now, and he does indeed have Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia, what is it going to be like as it progressively gets worse? In the last month itself I have felt it get worse.

Any advice is appreciated, both on how to approach my father and try to make him see a doctor, as well as how I can help my mother cope better with this. Thanks in advance!","I don’t think you’ll be able to make him go, we’ve had serval appts schedule for my grandma who’s gonna be 81 in a month and each appt has been canceled. 

My only suggestion is to bring it up during a yearly appt. That’s how we started and got the ball rolling. Elder people losing their independence is very rough. My grandma has struggled more mentally over things that shouldn’t be something to worry about. But once she fixated on something she spirals emotionally until whatever she’s worried about is fixed or explained in a way she understands.
I don't know where you are, I'm in the UK. I was worried about my dad, my mum wouldn't help me get him to a doctor, and he wouldn't go himself (they are rockily married). I ended up emailing his gp in advance of an appointment I knew he had coming up for an unrelated issue. I explained to the GP some of the things I was noticing, and asked him for advice. The GP brought my email up when dad was there and said that he always took emails like mine very seriously. Dad was referred to the memory clinic, initially diagnosed with Mild Cognitive impairment, and then Alzheimer's a year ago.
Compassionate lying is a big part of it for the family of dementia patients.  Find a way to get him to the doctor, maybe say you're going somewhere else, or maybe say the doctor needs to see him about something else.  Constantly correcting his mistakes or pointing out his repetition isn't going to help anyone and ultimately just make him upset.  Sometimes it's better to just go along with it, even if it's a question that's been asked 10 times. 

 Sometimes it's pride or denial but in my experience most people with dementia will not admit anything is wrong, and if they will won't acknowledge it being a cognitive issue.  Ultimately the goal for the family is keeping the person happy, comfortable and safe, and if that means letting them live in their own little bubble... is that so bad?
Could your mom take your dad to an in-person appointment without letting him know in advance? If she goes this route, she should make sure the doctor's office can communicate with her about your dad's health, and that the phone number associated with his file is changed to your mom's (in case they send an appointment reminder text etc). She should also start working on medical power of attorney for him if that's not in place. You can use all sorts of compassionate lies to get him into the doctor's office. Maybe the doctor needs to assess his wheelchair. If he's on any prescriptions, maybe the doctor needs to see him in person before renewing them. The Alzheimer's Association (provides info about all types of dementia, not just alz) also has a forum called alzconnected where you can search and get ideas. As to what to expect in the future, for quick info the alz association website is great, and for a longer read I suggest the book The 36-Hour Day. I was able to borrow it from my public library and read it on my phone, but copies are available on Amazon too for pretty cheap.",2022-04-04 12:19:08,throwaway040422_,tw6145
Dementia,This is not a life,"My husband has FTD. He’s in the early middle stages. This morning he yelled at me “ I want a life! This is not a life. I feel like I’m losing my mind.”

I wanted to say “ yeah..that’s two of us” but what would that accomplish. I asked him what he wanted…what would make things better or make him happy. What *would* be a life? He couldn’t answer me. He then said he needs to see a doctor so they can fix him. I suspect he’s aware of how much more he’s been struggling and he’s feeling panicky about it. 

I still have to work full time so even with Covid restrictions easing up it’s not like we could travel much( that was always our retirement goal). I have tried suggesting hobbies, activities, etc but he always shoots me down. Even if we could travel I doubt he would enjoy it. New places get him flustered these days and even when we go for drives, something he used to enjoy, he just sits there and doesn’t want to talk or joke and doesn’t seem to be interested in anything around us. 

I have an appointment scheduled with his psychologist because I suspect this might be depression related. He’s on Prozac but I wonder if it’s not helping much. 

Has anyone else had experience with this? How do you handle it? I can’t say “ yeah this sucks but this IS our life right now and we have to find what happiness we can” when the person doesn’t know or can’t articulate what would make him happy?","[deleted]
Yeah, travel is out, my hubby gets confused in strange places.  We do go for rides, usually he is silent the whole time but I don't mind.  We do talk about how his brain is dying and he is very aware of what he is losing. He is on three antidepressants which balance him out but he is low level depressed most of the time.  Last year he asked me to buy a convertible (he hasn't been able to drive in over a year) so I did and whenever the sun is out we go for a drive under the condition I find curvy roads and go fast and that brings him joy.  You love him, be as supported as you can, he's dying in a slow and horrible away and he knows it.  It's ok to validate what he is feeling and let him know you will do whatever you can to help him.  Good luck.
Giant hug to you. I know this is the future for me and my husband, so thank you for sharing. I wonder what your husband would do if you *did* say “yeah this sucks but it is our life now and we have to find what happiness we can”? Maybe it would at least remind him that this is tough for you as well and that you are still a team even if you have had to take on the team captain/coach role.
My father had rapid decline in the past year, but also shared a similar phrases when I asked him what having dementia is like…”it feels like I am losing my mind”. 

This journey will only become harder, not easier. It’s a terrible disease and gives such a low quality of life to those experiencing and those caregiving. Remember to put yourself first, it’s a long journey and you can’t do everything. You are not alone.
Yeh, sorry it's hard!  Maybe some 'yeah so sorry mate, this sucks eh' validations, and hooking him up with dementia .org counselling & their tons of resources would also be helpful.  Maybe they can find some day-respite activities / groups, or mens sheds in your area he could go to.  My mum also adamantly claimed she didn't want to or need to go to day-respite outings or groups, I really had to wheedle her to go 'just once, just to try it' - immediately she was happy to go, it's been god-send for us both.  They pick her up, take them to community centre for appropriate activities, lunch, & drop back home.  Super.  She goes 4 days a week now, to 3 different - community-based, & aged-care facility-run ones.   best of luck!
>even when we go for drives, something he used to enjoy, he just sits there and doesn’t want to talk or joke and doesn’t seem to be interested in anything around us. 

Just wanted to throw out there that he may be enjoying or enriched by the activity even if he doesn't *appear* to be. My stepfather has FTD and he is like this. Expressing enjoyment or desire is difficult for him, if he sees something amusing he will smile... but slowly, a few minutes after it happens. Going for a drive, things go by too fast for his reactions to keep up, but we think it is still a good activity for him to see things outside the house. Walks too. 

I guess we don't really know if he IS enjoying anything we do with him, but what I'm trying to say is that a lack of displayed interest may be deceiving. Whatever he's feeling, he seems to have trouble showing it, but that doesn't mean the feelings aren't there. So, we've just kept doing the things he used to enjoy (modified for his abilities), hoping they still cheer him up on some level.
My husband has dementia with his Parkinson's. Just recently, he was having more issues than usual, and I commented that I was sorry he was having a bad day. His response was basically that ALL his days are bad, some are just worse than others. This is so true. His main activities these days are watching television and going for a car ride. So, whenever possible, I watch television with him, or load him up and drive some back roads so we can both enjoy some nature scenery. 

Periodically, he decides he no longer wants to take his meds, and then I have to remind him that everything he takes is to help with his quality of life, not quantity. It breaks my heart that he's suffering and hoping to escape his reality as soon as possible, but there's nothing I can do, other than be supportive and offer what little comfort I can.
I lead an Alzheimer’s Association support group for caregivers, and my Mum attends one for people experiencing dementia. We both find them helpful. Mum used to lead a caregiver group when my late Dad was living with dementia. 

The state when you know what is happening and what the future entails is scary and difficult for all. The more support and understanding, the better. Wising you peace.
I recently discovered Teeva Snow. She is a valuable resource on what is going on from his perspective and has invaluable advice on how to communicate with some one with dementia.
If he's taking Prozac he's still taking pills. It's a good sign that if he could meet a psychiatrist (psychology + medication specialist) there could be better pills for him than Prozac. Try to find one who specializes or has experience with elder/dementia care.
So we saw the dr on Friday. Just so happens it was a “good” day for my husband so when the dr was asking him about his feelings of frustration and grief about what is happening to him, he was all “ I feel pretty good..everything is ok” 
The doctor did listen to me about what I’ve been seeing and thinks the Prozac isn’t working anymore and is having us try something else. 
It is what it is. 
I don’t know how to get him help for his feelings of frustration and anger because if he’s not in that zone he doesn’t really feel like there’s a problem at all. I guess I need to just ride out the bad days and enjoy the good ones.",2022-04-04 09:38:38,London2129,tw28ze
Dementia,Barely keeping it together,"I(28m)was raised by my grandparents and lived with them( here in Alabama) until I was 25(brief stints living away before then) as a child I would have nightmares of my grandfather(55 at time of passing, he married my grandma when my mom was 9 making him my step grandfather) passing and only ever began to cry when I thought about the death of one of them. Just before the start of covid my grandfather offered to use his VA loan to buy a house big enough to accommodate my girlfriend and I and her two kids as well as them and the dog they've had since I was 17 however due to the tumultuous nature of the housing market post covid we couldn't find anything to accommodate my grandmother's(family with dementia 71) physical needs as well as my S/Os needs(mainly based around her(36f) kids(12f & 9m) needs like staying in that school system. Fast forward to December of last year, my grandfather passed away in a horrible way that could have been preventable had I been more aware of the signs(went septic due to gallbladder disease) and died alone in the Selma hospital(which kills me even now to type). I had roughly 6 minutes to greave before the reality set in on how bad my grandmother's dementia was. My mom initially agreed to travel back(in the evening) and forth(mornings) from her own home to my grandparents so she could remain in a familiar environment. This lasted for 1 month to the day until my grandmother had a sundown event to which my mom responded by having her hauled to the hospital and attempted to have her admitted the next morning which she didn't meet their criteria for. The next weekend right after my 1st negative covid test she asked me to watch her for 4 hours only to tell me after the fact that she refuses to take care of her anymore. My grandmother has now been with me for  about 2 full months and it's all gone to shit. My significant other can't handle the stress(ers) dementia has brought in. My grandmother had to go from living in a 2900 square foot home with just my old man and their dog to a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 kids and an adult that are strangers to her almost even without the dementia. I'm trying to get their old home sold to give myself some financial wiggle room as they were still paying on it. In just the last 2 months on a 40k annual I've shelled out between 6 and 9k in expenses including slight renovations to help the value of the house. I sit now at my storage facility almost 2 hours away from their home and about 5 minutes from my apartment where she is sleeping with the kids and my s/o home while this moving crew(we have no extended family really and my mom hasn't been much help as our relationship was poor even before my grandfather passed) I want badly to get back I to therapy which I'd started before he passed so unexpectedly but I hate dealing with someone who simply sympathizes and ""understands"" I need the kind of answers that will help me grow and get past childhood issues and now his trauma. Meanwhile I'm praying I can honor his memory to ""take care of his wife and helps dog"" since there was no living will. All I have now is her, the dog, and POA but due to the dogs abused living before my grandparents rescued him he's always been possessive over them. He recently bit my s/o again and she wants him removed from the home. Which is the best short term solution but I know it'll cause further decline. I was overwhelmed before I caught covid and now I feel like I'm either about to just barely hold it together or lose everything and end up on a 72 hour hold. No help, no non busy friends, no family able to help regularly. F*** man why did he have to die alone, the man upstairs can be so cruel.","Real sorry, man.

Nobody can blame you, and that includes you, try hard not to blame yourself too much.  You really can do only what you can do.  And you're doing all you can, and then some.

You know there are no ""great"" options, there's just the ""least bad"" options.

Hate to say it (I love dogs) but you may need to get rid of the dog.  You and your s/o have to hold it together, and you're asking a ton of your s/o already to help out with your grandmother as well as her kids.

(I know, ""life"" is asking a **lot** of you... but you still need to consider your s/o.)

You may be able to get local help.  At some point, you will need to put your grandmother in a nursing home, too -- maybe that point is now, maybe it's in several years, but it will come.

And one tiny little thing that helps me, sometimes, is writing my rage and frustration in an email to a dead-drop email address that only I have access to.  I don't have time or money for therapy right now, so email rants that will never be read help me process stuff.  But heaven forbid anybody ever reads them -- I've looked, they're not pretty...
Holy crap you have a lot on your plate.

I am so sorry this is your life right now but you need to start taking steps to preserve your sanity as well as your family life.  As hard as it might be try and find a rescue organization who will take the dog. Going to a rescue means the dog will be taken care of and they will find it a home.  You have to place your grandmother in a facility, you have no choice.  You cannot keep trying to take care of her, have a relationship with your SO and your children and maintain your employment.  There is no shame in placing her in a facility that can care for her an she would likely be better off because there will be others around and people there with the experience of taking care of someone with dementia.  You can't hold onto an idea of what you ""should"" be doing. You are well past that.  Do what needs to be done to salvage your life.  Good luck.
I just woke up from a 2 hour nap after being awake for 24 hours due to my full time job and making sure the movers got done packing everything into the storage unit. Didn't finish until 630 a.m... they started 4 days ago.
If you place g’ma in a facility, most likely it will be better for her as well as for you & your family. 

I took care of mom at home until she passed. I placed dad at the Veterans Center when he got too difficult for me to manage. 

A facility allows you to have your proper relationship instead of caregiver. Just think a work shift of 10 hours is so much easier than 24/7 caregiving. Take care of yourself OP.
Her PCP advised that she would allow herself to fade away and die if I did put her in a facility. I did look into one for a respite stay but all of my local facilities are private pay only",2022-04-04 03:14:51,R60Z33,tvvxci
Dementia,"Sudden and extreme dementia symptoms, agitation, elopement, 90y.o. female, not UTI","I'm looking for suggestions for medication to ask for,  for my grandmother. Her PCP, a nurse practicioner, has been very uncaring and uninterested. We are looking into a new PCP. 

Grandmother is 90 and lives alone (currently her son is staying almost 24/7 given the circumstance). Sudden and extreme change in mental status. It started shortly after she had a very horrific fall in the middle of the night early March and broke her nose and wrist. She says her life alert button didn't work, she thought she was going to die but reached my family by phone finally, and they took her to ER. She's on Coumadin and bled a lot. Very traumatic. She also suffered for a week before they ordered a 2nd xray and discovered her broken wrist, it didn't show on first xray.

2 CT scans 3 weeks apart (one the night she fell and one a few days ago) show no brain bleeds.
She had a UTI shortly after the fall and has been off antibiotics almost 2 weeks and is showing no improvement in mental status, in fact is declining rapidly, despite all urine and blood tests being normal at each doctor or ER visit.

Changes include: doesn't think she's in her own home of 70 years, thinks people are in her home or outside of it and she is in fear, and has eloped once so far, cries and becomes upset easily, recently said she hears music all night (she extremely hard of hearing and lives in a secluded area where there is no music going). 
She put on a coat over her pjs, put on shoes, and grabbed a flashlight and her cane and took off in 40 degree temps in the dark on foot, leaving her front door standing open, and ended up at a neighbors house (the only neighbor) quite a ways away asking for help. It started that this behavior was late evening or night time only, within a week she's now disoriented during the day too. Today she packed a bag with what little medicine was at her home and said she was leaving and going home and taking her cats with her. She began screamin at the top of her lungs at her son when he tried to gently, verbally redirect her. 

Her son has cooked meals for her and visits 3-4 times a day for the last six years or so since she becamed widowed. He lives a mile away and is now administering her medication each day so that she can't get it mixed up. 

We have no idea what's causing this and the ER doctor says it's ""trauma"" but give us no ideas of how to help her. Her son is the only close caregiver, his siblings live 2 hrs away. He is 70 and in poor physical health.  We don't want her sedated to the point that she's unaware of things or falls but something she could take daily to help with mood or stabili her would be nice. Her PCP orders 15 ativan at a time and right now it's calming her a little but we'd like to ask for something that could help prevent the episodes rather than giving her an ativan during the episodes. 

We prefer to not place her anywhere at this time since this is so new and sudden. We're hoping she will fade back to normal but it's not looking like it. 

Thank you for reading all this.","Hello OP, this sounds like a tough situation. Sometimes a fall and broken bone deplete a person’s cognitive reserve and lead to dementia. Some of what you’re seeing may be delirium. Your grandmother needs to be seen by a neurologist who specializes in memory disorders. Where do you live? Your grandmother absolutely cannot be left alone right now and needs someone with her 24/7. It sounds like her son is doing that. He may want to reach out to the Alzheimer’s Association (or you can) for some safety tips.
I don’t have a medical background, but went through somewhat similar with my 90 yr old mom, several months back. Sudden onset of acute confusion, disorientation, and restlessness. UTI was diagnosed and treated, but the confusion persisted. Didn’t seem like dementia, as the onset/decline was so sudden.

Ativan seemed to aggravate matters. NP wanted to prescribe Haloperidol next, but my research pointed to 1) while this has been standard of care awhile, more recently there is much doubt among MDs about its efficacy for delirium; and 2) contraindicated for those with long QT, which applies to my mom. 

So we settled on trying Trazodone. She gets a low dose (50 mg) nightly and more PRN. In her case, it seems to have helped. Not quite back to baseline, but much less acutely confused. We actually got a few months with no bouts of acute confusion. More recently she has gotten more confused, but nothing like the behavior we had last Sept.

Like I said, I have no med training, and this is but one personal experience. Furthermore I did have a trusted MD friend tell me Trazodone was not likely to help much. And it’s not like it has prevented (much less reversed) further cognitive decline. But it did seem to help stabilize my mom, so hope our experience might help you.

One last thing, my MD friend’s main advice through this was a medication review. Sometimes it’s medication which exacerbates, so a primary care provider should be trying to deprescribe as much as possible, rather than just throw more meds into the scenario.

Dementia,Approaching the end,"My grandmother is in the final days of her life and it’s absolutely devastating. I (21) have helped my parents caretake for the last year as things have progressed (in year 5 of her diagnosis), so I’ve seen the change and decline. And while I’ve been grappling with the emotions that come with imminent death, I find myself confronted by my own fear of this sort of finality and that she won’t see me graduate from university, go into my career, or be there to see my art in a gallery. 


I feel caught between shaming myself for selfishly wanting more time and trying to soothe my anguish by reasoning that I’m allowed to want more time and also want her to not be in pain. I know what I’m feeling  isn’t a unique experience, but I don’t know how to find a sense of stability in this— perhaps it’s the process of grief. 


Grieving the living is hard, but approaching the next part of grieving the absence feels so much more visceral. And as life marches on, I’ll have to continue to find ways of seeing to her memory while wrestling with her absence. Sending hugs to everyone here, this isn’t an easy thing to handle. Take care of yourself, please.","Very sorry for your loss.

My grandmother died less than a month ago. Death is nothing like the movies. It is traumatic and exhausting, and she likely won't even appreciate that you're with her in the final moments or give any profound wisdom or love. IME, she was just upset that her whole body hurt, whenever we changed her diaper and therefore woke her up, we were the immediate cause of her pain so she directed that anger towards us. 

Now that my grandmother no longer needs morphine every 2 hours, being spoonfed, her diaper changed twice a day, etc... we have actually had a chance to catch up on sleep, and even sit around looking at old photos. We took 3 weeks to plan a reception. People who knew her decades ago have come out of the woodwork to tell stories about her.
My Dad passed five years ago January a decade after his diagnosis, and after a year in bed with palliative and hospice care at home. I’d kidded myself into believing I was ready. Now we are caring for Mum who was diagnosed in 2020. 

The truth is that you are never ready to lose a loved one, even if you have cared for them through end of life. They call dementia “the long goodbye.”  In spite of his diminished capacity, he was still there every day. You still go through the stages of grief. 

I found grief counseling so helpful. Wishing you the best and sending support and strength to you as you navigate this sad time. Please look after yourself. Peace be with you.
There's nothing shameful about wanting more time with her. That's just love. And you can want that time while also wanting her to be out of pain. Those two things can feel contradictory, but they aren't.   


I'm not sure it's possible to feel stable in this sort of situation, because it is changing, and there's no plan about how or when it changes. All you can do is ride the wave.   


It's also normal for this sort of thing to make you question your own mortality. I'd guess all of us on this sub have thoughts about how we want to age and die based on what we've learned tending our own loved ones.   


As for whether she will see you graduate, etc, that depends on your own beliefs about an afterlife. Many people believe that our ancestors and loved ones continue to watch over us.   


I'm sorry for your pain, and your troubles. I'm glad you love your grandmother, and that she's had you in her life.
All I can say is bless you and send hugs.
I wish my dad the peace of eternal rest. He is miserable, confused, disoriented, terrified…. There is no way to soothe him sometimes. He would be horrified to see himself today. I feel so helpless and ineffective. Alzheimer’s sucks so bad.",2022-04-03 22:28:11,dollarstorekickflip,tvqw9s
Dementia,Door stopper / home security,"My mom has always been very nervous about home security - the kind of person who locks everything and does a couple rounds before going to bed. She lives alone and dementia has made her anxiety about home safety worse.

She had a door stopper on her front door, but I removed it because I thought it would be a safety risk in case I or someone else needed to get in her house. Is this really the case though? Couldn't the police/emergency responders get in through her windows?

It's been a couple times that she tells me she's looking for it and starts crying because she lived through a couple break-ins in her home country as a child. I would love to give the door stopper back to her to make her more comfortable at least until her dementia progresses further but worried if anybody needs access to her home.","Hmm, I'm not sure exactly what type of door-stopper, but if it's a simple wedge-type, could you make her one out of cardboard?  It would look like a door-stopper to her, but if anyone had to gain entry for emergency, they'd be able to crush it with force?",2022-04-03 15:54:31,Patient-Muffin-8599,tvi6r9
Dementia,Refusal to change soiled clothes?,Has anyone experienced a loved one refusing to change clothes that they have used the bathroom in? Today is the 1st time my uncle has not let me help him and I feel my only option is to wait and change him later if he'll let me.

Any advice or experience is welcomed thank you!,"There's a Teepa Snow videos on YouTube that covers this. I can't exactly remember her suggestions.

I've also heard of people successfully telling the person that it's state law to be cleaned up every day and if needed print a ""notice"" of this to back it up.


Sometimes selling them on clean clothes without mentioning the cleanliness part, like ""Look what I just found! These have to be the most soft, comfortable pants I've ever found. Want to try them? Oh and they'll be even softer with this pair of underwear, yours might feel scratchy with them.""",2022-04-03 11:05:39,carolinabluebird,tvbbg5
Dementia,I bloody hate mornings,"Bit of background...

Husband has been having memory/anxiety issues related to MCI/poss early-onset dementia for a couple of yrs now. Has had an assessment with the memory clinic nurse, then referred to specialist psychiatrist. Now has an assessment appt with specialist neuropsychology Dr in a couple of weeks.

Later at night and early in the morning are the most difficult times, for him and me. He is more confused and anxious at these times than the rest of the day.

He often wakes up ages before he's supposed to, usually around 5am, with terrible anxiety about things. This morning, he woke up really upset, thinking he had lost his money, because he couldn't see his wallet. The wallet was in his bedside drawer, right next to him. I gently told him this, and gave the wallet to him, but he still thought he'd lost money, because..... I don't know why.

I'm getting so bloody tired of being woken up, my sleep is messed up and I can't settle down again either.
I'm thinking of sleeping downstairs, just so I can have a little bit of quiet time.

I know this isn't anyone's fault, I know it's not his fault, but I can't help feeling the way I do. I'm tired. All the time. 

When everyone else has gone to bed, I stay up late so I can have peace and quiet, as its the only time I can do. 

As he doesn't have a diagnosis yet, this makes things more difficult in terms of support and related stuff. And he's only 61.

Just wanted to get this crap out of my head, just for a bit. 
Thankyou.

Edit:  he's on Mirtazipine 30mg and Melatonin prn","> He often wakes up ages before he's supposed to

In addition to Bonnie's recommendation, I might ask if a sleep aid would help here
I would check back with the doctor. Maybe they would be willing to prescribe him something for anxiety before his neuropsychologist visit. My husband started taking Lexapro 2 years ago when he was 53 and being diagnosed with MCI. I think he started taking it shortly before his neuropsychologist visit. I hope this helps you and your husband.
Melatonin has been helping with my dads sleep quite a bit.

I’m so sorry though. The hardest part of this has been the toll on my mother, both physically and mentally. We try to help with bedtime routines because he’s really snappy and combative because of how frustrated and anxious he’s gotten and it’s really hard but it seems like it’s easier when its my brother or I because we have a different relationship and he isn’t as resentful. 

Wishing you the best of luck and would say that in addition to getting a diagnosis make sure to get power of attorney, advance healthcare directives and more importantly have some conversations about what his wishes are now so that you know what they are and don’t have to guess later when he can’t share or is maybe saying something very different.
My 59yo husband has bipolar2 & mild cognitive problems (short term memory loss and mental processing) an well as tremors that have particularly worsened the last year. We too are seeing multiple professionals regarding his movement disorder, memory and reasoning issues to get him sorted out and given a diagnosis we can work with.  Because he is a bipolar, Drs in the past just kicked the can down the road blaming his issues on over medication.  Now that that has been adjusted and ruled out, we are seeking diagnosis. It’s probably dementia.

Due to his past nighttime manic antics and (now sometimes) incontinence, I’ve set myself up in the guest bedroom where I can see his door from
Mine. I sleep better, and I believe he does too.

He is on evening sleep meds prescribed by a psychiatrist (to treat his manic bipolar2). He has a white noise machine in his room. We keep the room dark, temp constant year round, and do not allow pets into his room. He has a set 9pm -8:30am sleep cycle. His sleep meds make it so he needs this much sleep. It sometimes results in his needing naps during the day as well.

Without these prescription sleep meds he would obsess, roam the house and get into trouble like take the car out.
Just because it's no one's fault doesn't mean it doesn't suck. Your feelings are valid. Please look into respite care before you are burned up. You can't take care of your partner if your own tank is empty.
One bright outlook based on what you stated is that most dementias would have greatly advanced within the timeframe you discussed.  His neuropsychological testing (typically 3-4 hours long) will be quite beneficial in determining this.

Early-onset dementias tend to be more rapid than late-onset and if he has had MCI for a couple of years then it is less likely to be a neurodegenerative disease.

How is he, psychologically speaking?  Depression and anxiety can cause remarkable cognitive impairments but it does not typically advance greatly over time.  You did speak of fairly significant anxiety and if his sleep is inadequate this too can cause impairment.  

Hopefully, he is able to improve and I wish you the best!",2022-04-03 10:01:48,Wheezy0891,tv9ylw
Dementia,Venting,"Been taking care of my husband for several years now, he is not progressed to the point of not being able to do some things for himself but I am still on duty 24/7.  Yesterday he was rude to me in the grocery store for no reason, just out of the blue mean.  We got to the car and he started to apologize and I started screaming at a volume and pitch I have never done before.  It was shocking to me but I couldn't stop.  I guess the burden of what is to come and all we have lost and all the times in the past he has been mean just came together in a furious ball of anger.  It took hours for my heart rate to go down and I slept on the couch.   I had no idea that kind of rage was living inside me. Please, no one tell me his being mean is the disease or that I need counseling and support. I just needed to get this off my chest so I can start new today.","You're only human. Tomorrow will be better.
My husband has dementia, won’t take a shower, put on clean clothes or shave (for months). Prior to this issue, I was very unhappy and contemplating divorce. Now I feel stuck with him and I can honestly say that I do not like him. In order to prevent me from venting to him (because it does no good) I just don’t talk to him anymore unless absolutely necessary. This is probably a bad thing for me to do, but I find it’s the only way to  maintain my sanity. I hate my life.
I'm surprised you've taken years. I've heard the most gutteral noise come out of me before. I think it's grief. It's a new day.
I yelled at my dad too, once. On the plus side, he forgot about it almost immediately. It's ok. Today is a new day.
We get it. Big hug to you.
I've been there. If you let them they can suck every moment of joy out of your life, and then of course you feel horribly guilty for feeling that way. I've taken to singing ""let it go let it go let it go"" fairly loudly until the anger or whatever it is passes. My dad just looks at me when I do that but it helps me. Another thing I have done is committed to counting to 5 before I say anything to him. This is also very helpful. And prayer is essential for me. Hang in there. And cherish every moment of even the most vague hint of lucidity. Someday it will be the last one.
I care for my 59yr old husband with mental decline & bipolar. We moved to another state 9 months ago to get better care. He has never been mean, but he has been inconsiderate and Thankless in his actions. 

I got to the point of anger and yelling too, followed by resentment and just not talking to him.  We are both introverts, so alone time when together has never been odd for us.

Then I found the support of r/dementia. 

Family and friends just don’t get the constant grind of 24/7 care of someone with mental and/or cognitive issues. Venting to them gets me nowhere.

Errors in his reasoning, judgement and actions have huge impacts.

Just yesterday, after spending 2 days trying to get a refill of a very expensive & specialized med from multiple local pharmacies, where we had to provide blood work results, have new script called in from Dr., etc., we arrive home and he throws the medication in the trash.
Not good...

We have these hiccups multiple times a week and sometimes daily, and the level of household stress reflects it.

But, after reading r/dementia posts I know I am not alone. I get very good suggestions on dealing with what I have control over and what I don’t. 

I used to think I was just dealing with a new him, one who was intentionally making my life hell. Now I really do see, he can’t help it, and if he could, he would. How scary it must be for him. 

I still get angry but sometimes it shows up in lashing out inappropriately to other stressors. I’m working on that.
The unnecessary meanness came out of my mom early on, and at the time, I didn't realize that it was part of the dementia coming on, because she didn't even have a diagnosis yet. She would say terribly hurtful things to me every time I interacted with her, and since we'd already had a tenuous relationship for most of my adulthood, I took it to mean that she just flat-out despised me.

It wasn't until later on, after she'd moved on from that phase to short memory loops and speaking in word salad, that I began to understand where that meanness had come from. When the diagnosis finally came,, it didn't take away the pain she'd caused me, but it did put it into context in a way that helped me process it, if that makes sense.

I'm so sorry your husband is in that phase. I was lucky in the sense that I didn't live with my mom and I wasn't yet responsible for helping my dad with her. Looking back, I'm sure my dad must have caught the brunt of it, being with her all day every day, but he was so invested in keeping their problems swept neatly under the rug that he never let on that she was giving him a hard time. He just internalized it all, and I honestly think the stress of managing her is what led to his own health declining sharply after several years of being her 24/7 caretaker.

So I'm glad you have places to reach out for support and to vent, and I hope you are able to find some kind of respite care for him so that you can have time to take care of yourself during the hard parts, because even though the meanness will pass, there will be other hard things that take its place. Big, big hugs.
Going through this will try your patience til you have no other feelings but anger or resentment that come out when you don't mean to. I'm sorry and ashamed when it happens. I hope today will be better for you. Were all just trying our best to navigate this ever worsening disease.
* I'm truly sorry that he was mean to you.

* I'm sorry that you're human, and you reacted the way you did because you're human.

* I'm actually glad, in a way, that because you're normally a well-adjusted human, you're not used to experiencing that kind of rage.  Sorry it happened to you.

Now.  One of the ""advantages"" of dementia -- no that's definitely not right, there are no advantages -- one of the aspects of dementia that's not quite as awful as most of the other aspects is that you **can** reset yourself.  The person with dementia is unlikely to remember everything that went on, they may not get stuck in the memory of your blow-up the way you are, if that makes sense.

Your rage was real.  From what you say, your rage was deserved.  But you will move on from it.  And when you do move on from it, your husband is unlikely to hold it against you as much as he would have when he was fully in his right mind.

(Obviously, because you're a decent person, you're not going to take advantage of this by blowing up at him all the time.)

You're already trying to process the event by writing about it here.  You know it wasn't normal.  Obviously, it's not who you want to be.

For what it's worth, I set up a dead-drop email address that no one else knows about, and I'll send emails to it with all sorts of rage and fury and protestations and swearing and... you get the point.  It helps me to write down all the things that I'd tell people if I were a lot nastier than I am.

Good luck with it all.
I yelled at my MIL the other day. I yelled at my mom, my dad, and my FIL.   It's hard to separate the emotions that stem from the relationship from the job of the caregiver. Being both a spouse/child/grandchild/sibling of a sufferer and their caregiver is just so fucking hard.
My heart goes out to all of you. Our dad had dementia and the 4 1/2 of us took care of him 24/7 for 2 1/2 years. Our dad was kind and peaceful and calm. He was never angry or mean, other than we he sun downed at night....we had Ativan for sleeping. We always get asked about how mean was he, did he fight us, did he stay agitated. People are surprised when we say no

However caregiver burn out is real. For those who are doing it along, you are heroes. We rotated but the max was 4-5 days, then we rotated out. 

You all are amazing, be kind to yourself. Don't feel guilty for being angry and frustrated. Your love one won't remember
Sometimes it’s just hard, you know? Sometimes it’s hard physically, emotionally, a combination. You are only human much like the rest of us and unfortunately sometimes we just sort of snap or break down consciously or unconsciously. It doesn’t mean you are a bad person nor that you even need therapy. You just need a moment to yourself sometimes. My grandma gets mean god does she get mean as ever sometimes when I care for her. Somethings that I do that helps me is run the shower and take a moment to cry in the bathroom for a few minutes to get pent up emotion out of my system. I try to have one day a week to get out of the house I usually go to the lake or park because nature is very healing to me and it has made a big difference on my mental state to just have a moment to breathe. Often I have to remind myself to hold back my tongue and remember the good moments and memories. For what it’s worth, taking care of someone is an difficult job and I am sure you are doing your absolute best considering your situation. Something my grandpa told me is take it day by day, that’s really all you can do. Today is a new day, tomorrow will be a new day, and the next day. Your doing okay I promise you.
I’d be more worried if you didn’t vent. Holding it in can be fatal to the caregiver - and the statistics show that. Let’s hold down how much we beat ourselves up. 

For me, I’ve already forgiven myself for what’s supposed to come next Wednesday - bringing her officially to a memory care community. It’s been a long 5 years…
I understand. The frustration and rage I felt for my dad's completely insane behavior was off the charts. Yadda yadda compassion yadda yadda it's the disease - after a certain point fuck that. You're dealing with a literal lunatic who's incapable of behaving like a reasonable person and their incapacity is ruining your life. Any human would be driven out of their mind by this 
<hugs>
I feel this so much. I’m in a similar position but I haven’t let it out yet. I think I’m scared if I did I wouldn’t be able to stop or I’d break somehow. 
We are human. We are stuck in a horrific frustrating place. Be easy on yourself.
So sorry :(

How do you feel now?
You sound like I did the other day. My husband is in the early stages and it’s taking both of us time to make new adjustments, me especially. I’m taking over things like the bills that I hadn’t done for years, we had a child (grown adult) who was deep in the throes of addiction gaslight him into doing things he shouldn’t have to get money from us, I also have aging parents needing more help in a different state and was stretched really thin and then the straw came and broke me. He said something and I just exploded. I yelled, screamed and pounded on the table while rage crying and telling him it wasn’t his fault. It was just one too many things to juggle, whatever it was, and to leave me the f alone for 10 minutes. It wasn’t my best moment. 

I told him later once I had myself under more control that he was my safe place, my person I knew who could see me at my worst and still be there. He’s really a good man. This shit is hard and we are only getting started. 
I’m glad I can do virtual counseling. It does help b
I struggle with finding an appropriate or ‘good’ outlet for anger. Sometimes screaming is the only way to let it out. Sending solidarity.
Treasure the moments when Dr Jekyll shows up rather than Ms Hyde. I actually just had one of those with my wife, who’s still at the Senior Behavioral Unit at the hospital. I hope to remember that as much as the angry times that’s the usual. Please try to find those moments of the combined happiness and sadness.
I'm so sorry you're going through this.  It's OK - we're only human.  I yelled at my mom once, too.  I feel really bad about it because I know it's the disease.  It happens, don't beat yourself up too much over it.  \*\*Hugs\*\*
Omg! You sound just like me! While my husband is a kind man he has always had a terrible temper and it’s HORRIBLE! He is perfectly able to care for himself at this time, but his temper has gotten much worse, constantly apologizing, which makes me crazy! To me if your sorry then stop it!!!!! I constantly remind myself this is the disease, and will get much worse. It still hurts and makes life so very hard. I can tell you though that through my prayers, God is helping me to not be so anxious all the time. God bless you my dear as the road ahead is long and hard, from what I understand. 😏🙏🏼",2022-04-03 08:45:33,jadesisto,tv8gdm
Dementia,activities and covid,"Im thinking of putting my dad in a nursing home.  The one im thinking of still doesnt have any activities provided.  They say its because of covid.  They are constructing a new building right now and say activities will start again once that new building is done in May.  

Is this normal in the US or are they just bring super cheap and trying to save money?  But would open activities again cause they are heavily marketing right now due to the large number of vacancies needed to be filled with their new building.","i believe the covid line - we have that around us too. people are usually paired up in rooms, and if they didn’t have a physical structure that allows for social distancing guidelines from the federal and/or state governements, then they’re stuck.  the assisted living places around us have
group activities again because people usually have their own room and for some reason the buildings have better room layouts for socially distanced activities.

that said, they’re all marketing heavily anyway, so take the marketing with a grain of salt.
I think my grandma's facility has paused some activities but not all. I have seen them put on little concerts, and during Christmas some of the residents did a choral concert. I think the stuff they've paused is people visiting the facility and doing group activities, but the caregivers are still spending time with them and doing things like art, puzzles, crafts, etc. Grandma also goes to the beauty shop once a week, but that's on-site.

You're right to assume that if there's a COVID outbreak, or if there's a really bad variant, the facility will go on lockdown (for good reason), but the ones my grandma's been through haven't been too long. Maybe 4-6 weeks, depending on how bad it is?

Something that helped me decide which facility to apply for was talking to my grandma's social worker in hospice. If you have a local Aging and Disability Program give them a call and ask to speak with a social worker that specializes in placing seniors in memory care. They can tell you which facilities are reputable and which aren't.
I work in activities at a memory care home. I know they paused activities during the height of pandemic but they've restarted them here. I started working in November so i'm not entirely sure when activities started up again.
Yes, Covid would be the reason. I think the real question is why they will start up in May in the new building. Why not start now? My mom lives in a senior apartment building that had all sorts of activities before Covid. Those got shut down and I really think management is stalling starting things up again because they realized how much easier it is for them to not be in charge of things like movie nights and super bowl parties.",2022-04-03 06:17:27,heehee63,tv64z2
Dementia,how to cope,"i’m 14 and my dad is 54. he’s been diagnosed with dementia since about late 2018. it’s gotten worse and i’m not sure what to do. i get angry and impatient with him which makes me feel terrible after. even when he attempts to talk on the phone with his friends and family, him stuttering makes me so upset. or when he attempts to make conversation with people and can’t find the proper words, i feel embarrassed. my sister (9) is oblivious to it and my mom struggles to help him as it gets worse everyday. he’s been taking speech therapy for these days but it’s no use. he is unable to recognize letters and words and he’s finally able to say a letter it’s the same three “a, j, x”. i want to be better and try to understand him but i’m unable to. i cry thinking about how i will lose my father and i can’t do anything about it.","You are going to experience your father in a different way. Some of it will be bad, but it can also bring joy. You can’t change what is happening. You can, however, go on the journey with your dad. Once you accept that this is a different version of your dad you will find it easier to be patient. It’s really hard but you are going to be fine and you may learn new things about your dad that will bring you closer. Stay strong and stay open
I completely understand. I was so mad at my mother for acting how she does and for me it was a huge relief to get the dementia diagnosis. At least I now know it isn't voluntary, she cannot help how she's acting. Try to remind yourself of that. It's similar to a child, if you see a toddler throwing a fit you may roll your eyes and sigh but you understand that is their way....it is the same with our parents with dementia.
Your feelings are totally justified. We all get angry with our loved ones with dementia. To make it worse, you're 14 which is a very difficult age for you too. Plus your mom really has her hands full and likely can't give you the attention she wants to. It might help to have someone to talk to. See if your guidance coumselor or someone similar can find you an online support group or if your mother can find you a therapist.

You have my sympathy for what it's worth. This is hard enough to deal with at 53. I can't imagine how hard it must be at 14.
I was 12 when my grandmother got diagnosed. I'd gone my whole life up to that point spending weekends, holidays, after schools, and camping trips with my grandmother. She lived just down the road and we were closer than anything.

When I was 12, she came to our house and accused me of stealing money from her purse, breaking into her house through the windows, using her car, and throwing parties in her house. Thankfully I had an alibi as I was *literally twelve years old*.

Three months later, round two. This time it was trying to burn her house down. Again, thankfully I had an alibi as I was asleep on the couch and thirteen years old.

After that, she no longer lived on her own and we had no contact for over a year.

I'm actually going to visit her today. Cross my fingers she remembers me.
I’m so sorry you have to cope with this at such a young age.  Nobody is ready for this when it happens to a parent, but at your age you still need your Dad to parent you - not the other way around.  Getting angry and frustrated is a normal response for what’s happening in your life.  Speak to a teacher or a guidance counsellor, you need an outlet for your feelings.  Hang on, you will get through this.",2022-04-02 21:33:16,cchangkyun,tuxnc4
Dementia,"If a hospice patient hurts themselves and needs to go to the hospital, is it covered by hospice?","My wife is in in-home hospice and got outside on her own when I forgot to latch the door. She walked a little ways and fell face-first on the sidewalk. When I found her soon after, her face was covered in blood. I was afraid she had cuts that needed stitches or broke or cracked a cheek bone. You must call hospice first, not 911, so I called and they told me I could call non-emergency paramedics but they couldn’t take her to the hospital, or we would pay. I cleaned her up and put ice on it while waiting, and paramedics checked her good when they got here and luckily no cuts or broken bones.   


Question is, what if a hospice patient  falls and breaks a limb or pelvis and needs to go to hospital? Is the patient paying for hospital bills? Thanks for any info.","Call Hospice and ask the social worker to come to the house and go over what is and is not covered for bills.
Are you in the US? Is your wife Medicare eligible?

The way it was explained to me for my mom when she started hospice, is if mom had to go to the ER for a trauma injury or something else requiring a hospital visit, the 800 number hospice person on call would handle the paperwork to temporarily switch my mom back to Medicare.  Thankfully we never had that dilemma so I don’t know if it was as simple as that, but the hospice admin I spoke with about that scenario made it sound like it was kind of a regular thing and they’d handle it.

Hopefully someone else that has had this happen will chime in.
The answer is not black and white. If your loved one goes to the hospital for treatment such as stitches or fixing a broken bone putting on a cast etc. and does not require admission, Then insurance covers at least in part. If admission is required hospice needs to be revoked to avoid double billing. These are very good questions to ask for your hospital social worker. I’m sharing this as a hospice registered nurse case manager.
My dad was on home hospice. My sister was taking him to the bathroom and he lost his balance and fell against the wall real hard. He was had lost most of his vocabulary and all he would do is frown and shift around in the chair. We called hospice and a nurse came out. She did a head to toe exam. She said he had no broken bones, we were concerned about his hip. She said the option was to call an ambulance to take him to the ED(COVID was rampant) for an X-ray and if he did have a broken hip, we would just treat his pain, he was not a candidate for an operation. So we watched him treated with crushed up Tylenol but had morphine in the hospice kit if needed
That’s insane. Is your wife on Medicare? Maybe the hospice would discharge her, but Medicare would cover the hospital stay and she could be readmitted to hospice.",2022-04-02 21:16:25,Wearycarer,tuxao3
Dementia,grandmother sleeps all day and all night,"does anyone else have parents/grandparents that just sleep all day? my grandma is on an anti seizure medication which the doctor warned us would make her tired, but she’s sleeping for 20-22 hours a day now and when she is tired, she can no longer do things like walk, talk, or understand basic instructions. when she gets up in the morning she is fine, and within 20 minutes she’s asleep again. she is for the most part immobile without some form of help for stability, but earlier today it took three of us to get her up from a sitting position. is she nearing the end?","Ask her Dr to check her meds. Many have side effects of sleepiness.

I waited 3 years! and a move to another state, to delve deep into my husbands daily sleepiness. All it took was a change in nighttime “sleep” meds, to ensure a better day after.
My 67 year old mother is on anti seizure meds as well and she sleeps a lot.  Unfortunately, she still wakes up at night though.  I'd be curious to hear someone else's take as well.",2022-04-02 18:54:37,hrfarris,tuvmie
Dementia,How can we handle racist behavior in 91 year old MIL?,My MIL has been getting harder to take care of so we decided to bring in a home health care worker 2x a week to help out. The 1st women was a pleasant white women who my MIL tolerated until she left and then went off on us for letting the “cooky lady” in. Today the company sent a young black women she was nice and polite but the 2nd my MIL saw her she became angry. After 20 mins of MIL ranting to this poor girl we finally said she shouldn’t have to take this abuse and she could leave. I’ve heard stories and that health care workers are used to it but I’m not and I was just so angry at her for treating anyone like that. I guess really I just need to vent.,"This was ultimately why my MIL ended up in residential care.  She wouldn't tolerate any POC or even an accent.  Now, she's cared for by people of all races, ages, and linguistic skills but has no ability to demand we fire them.
Yeah another reason why dementia sucks. My mom was never racist but became so with dementia, she isn't giving visible minorities a hard time per say like your mom, but she will say in appropriate things related to race.  I've apologized to restaurant staff, saying ""I'm sorry she has dementia"" warned PSW in hospitals that had to watch her door that she may say something offensive, when I did I got the "" It's ok we're use to it"" 

You could have a talk with the company just to give them a heads up so to speak.
Oh do I remember this particular joy.  Sadly it might just come down to finding the right carer. My Mum was a bigoted racist person before dementia (I absolutely hated this about her but I never changed her) so once the dementia kicked in hooo boy she got worse! No carer should ever be subjected to abuse or insults and even if you explain it to them - it makes the whole situation just bad. Explain to the service the problem and find an option that works, as distasteful as this is.
It's sad, but you basically have to cave in and have the ""right"" person as a caregiver. It's hard enough to get an old racist without dementia to stop being racist, it's practically impossible for someone with it. We went through 4 or 5 at-home caregivers for my dad before eventually giving up and putting him in a home. Luckily he's been getting along with everyone there.
Been there, done that, and it's so incredibly embarrassing.
Thankfully my mother hasn’t become racist. But did she go from very polite, to hitting caregivers, screaming, threatening them, cursing at them. It really pisses me off, so I know how you feel. It sucks. There’s very little to do about it, sadly. GL
My grandma isn't ""mean"" racist, but for some reason she thinks every black person she sees with an afro is wearing a wig!  She'll ask me in this confused voice ""Does he/she have a wig on?""",2022-04-02 14:51:54,pagan-love,tuq767

Dementia,Need help to understand.,"So, my great grandfather has dementia. I have no idea how far the disease has progressed but I want to understand how you are supposed to deal with things that he may or may not understand. I’m the youngest in the family and I feel as though I have the least say in how these things are handled. Recently, my great grandmother had passed away, his wife of over 60 years, and nobody has really told him what happened. I feel as though he knows but since I can remember he’s always been a quiet man never really objecting to what you told him. My family has tried to tell him the she “went to the store” or “is out right now” but she hasn’t done things like that for many years now and I feel like he knows. He will ask about her from time to time and always get those answers and that seems to satisfy him for the time but the question always come back in a different way weather it’s where’s your “mother, carol, grandmother, things like that. He always seems to remember people faces and has a huge smile when he see us. What I really want to know is would it be a good idea to actually tell him what is going on. Or would that bring unnecessary problems if he did not remember a few days later. If anyone has dealt with this with family or friends I would really appreciate your insight. 

Thanks!","[deleted]
I work on a memory care unit. A few of my residents will ask if I’ve seen their mother or father. Some days they know that their parents have passed, some days they think they are just at work.
On days when they are aware, I try to comfort them as best I can. On the days where my residents think their parents are still around, I tell them “maybe mom is at work” (or something along those lines) and then try to redirect them into an activity or a walk or something. Inside I do feel bad for lying when I know the truth, but if I tell them their mom or dad is not around anymore they crumble into pieces and are inconsolable, which in turn can trigger other behaviors and set them on a course for a bad day or even week.
Dementia is so different for each individual and it’s a hard thing to navigate. I know this isn’t any actual advice but I hope it can help you figure out how to go about your situation.

But the weirdest thing he does is every time he sees words he reads them he’s too wondering through the house looking for things the read and them reads them out loud. 
He can be screaming swear words and other rude things and then just sees a letter on the side and suddenly starts reading it. 
Just wondering if anyone else has seen this and if you know why they do it?","I had to stop wearing t-shirts with anything printed on them because my mom would obsessively read what it said, aloud, at least once every few minutes. She will read any- and everything, even the subtitles on the TV while the sound is on. 

May I recommend the books by Emma Rose Sparrow that are written specifically for people with dementia? In the descriptions online it explains what level of dementia they're for, but NOWHERE ON OR IN THE BOOK ITSELF does it mention that, and they're clearly also adult books. They're simple, have little conflict, and my mom *LOVES* them. (She's reading one out loud to me right now, in fact!) (Also, the occasional amazon reviews that are written by people who don't understand dementia are kinda hilarious, because they're complaining about all the things that make them perfect for our needs!)
Don't give him big, heavy books. Put up posters with poems, recipes, short stories --- things that he will see and stop to read. If it's paper on a wall, the worst he can do it rip it down.
My mom used to read every sign on buildings, roads, doors, banners, etc.  One of the more fascinating things was how well she could read backwards.  There was a banner outside at her assisted living place and we’d be sitting on the front porch there, behind the banner, and she could read it backwards without hesitation.  Over and over. She couldn’t remember who I was but she often read transparent or translucent signs in reverse. And still loved looking through magazines, including ones in her second language.
There might be a medication that will help calm him down. There's no cure or perfect solution, but my husband is a little easier to live with now that we found the right drugs. I try to keep in mind that as miserable as his behavior sometimes makes me, he's just as miserable.
I’m in a dementia support group, which I HIGHLY recommend. There are so many variations in this horrible disease. One person in the meeting this week spoke of a relative who is to the point they can’t live alone, but is always reading multiple books at once. They can’t remember anything they read, but they love to read!
I’m a carer for people with dementia and we have a lady who does this.She’ll walk around reading the inspirational quotes on the walls and the notes on the fire doors and sit reading magazines out loud.If I’m wearing my catfish and the bottlemen tshirt every time she sees me she’ll read me
Yes, my mother-in-law does that, although she's not angry and aggressive. The reading out loud can be annoying, especially when she's reading credits and subtitles on TV shows.
My dad spent 4 hours yesterday reading the yellow pages. Fortunately not out loud.
Yes. I turn on Apple Music on the Apple TV with the lyrics so my dad can read and sing along. He’s a terrible singer but he loves to do this. It’s better than him just staring zombie like at the hallmark channel. He actually gets lively and fun reading lyrics, commercials, stuff like that
My mom reads every sign, store name, etc that she sees. It gets super annoying after a while.
Yes - my mom does this too! She also counts everything. Counts her steps, and just counts to herself when walking or fidgeting with anything…
Yup, my mom will read anything out loud that pops up on the tv screen.
I turn on the captions on the tv for my mom. Maybe that would catch his attention.  Edited—yeah, prob. won’t help if your goal is to have some peace (since he reads aloud).  Unless you do it in his room/area.  (Sorry)
Absolutely, my grandmother has her daytimer that she writes everything down in, often multiple times, and will read and re-read to us everything that happened or is going to happen in the current month.
My mum is more advanced and she doesn’t read but my dad still looks through the daily newspaper and relays some of the stories, albeit sometimes misinterpreted. He’s only a year in though and mum is probably around 8 years. Dad still takes the weekly supplement magazines up to the care home for my mum despite her not really being able to hold or focus on it now but it makes him happy.",2022-04-02 10:10:19,HanzeeeeDent,tujq7j
Dementia,Mom is angry about her passport,"My mom has a new passport after ""losing"" it (I'm pretty sure it's in her house but she hoards and we've never been able to find it). She lives alone with daily visits from my sister and I. She lost her state ID, passport, social security card, and Medicare card in one go last year. It was difficult but I got her a new state ID and passport.

My sister and I each have 1 of the IDs - I have her state ID and my sister has her passport. My mom very much wants to travel to her home country, and I think this is why she asks almost every day if her passport is safe with my sister. 

At this point she needs daily care and attention (we're starting to look at 3rd party care options) and I don't think traveling is a good idea. My parents were divorced a couple years before she started showing dementia symptoms, and it's like she's completely forgotten why, and she talks all the time about staying with my dad who lives in their home country. I also don't speak the language so I'd have to rely on her and that makes me very nervous. I'm also scared that if we did go, she would refuse to leave the country. I was waffling on a trip before and it breaks my heart to not go, but I just don't think it's a good idea.

Today she called my sister very angry demanding to have her passport. I almost want to give it to her knowing she'll lose it again, but what if she doesn't believe us when we tell her she has it now? It's been so important to her that she remembers my sister has it.

Has anyone ever made a fake passport for their LO? 😔","I was going to suggest a fake one! 

We made fake credit cards and IDs for my grandma in law. She couldn't be trusted with anything real, but she wanted to have the familiarity of going through her purse everyday to make sure she still had all her own things, and just having the fake, laminated cards in there was comforting.
Do you think she has the ability to make travel arrangements on her own ?  If not, you could give it back to her but would I be worried about her losing it again. Then the cycle repeats of you having you to get her another one so she can get rid of it - again. 

There's these key chains for Iphones (airtags) that you can put with the document in a bag, so when she loses it again. You'll be able to find it in the house. Unless she does what my mother did with her legal documents, throw them all out. 

Until my mother's affairs are in order I'm holding on to her bank card for dear life, everyone once and awhile she demands to have it.  Give it to her, she then says ""that' not my card"" (it is) and throws it on the table. I tell her well next time we'll  go to the bank and get you a new one. This happens every week or so.
We made multiple fakes of my mother in laws bank cards and passport - she would demand them, then hide/lose them around her house. It’s a comfort and security issue, she is incapable of using them but a lifetime of habit makes having them really important to her. 

She is also obsessed with having money in her purse, which gets easier as her cognition declines as she used to complain that a twenty dollar note was ‘nothing’ but was much happier with 4 five dollar notes as it looked like more. 
Now we fill her purse with coins and she perceives that as a lot of money, and when she asks for money every day she is so delighted when we give her a whole handful of change which equals around a dollar!
We made my grandmother fake keys and cards. I would have made a fake passport if that’s what it took to make her happy. (She didn’t know how to drive and wouldn’t have known how to make travel plans so that wasn’t a concern.)

Or is there a universal clamp or something that can be attached to wheeled walkers to do this?  

Do not want to spend more than $250.","You might want to have him assessed by a physical therapist and get the recommendation from him/her. Because of how my Dad walks and leans on his walker, the PT said it was important that he not have one with 4 wheels. He has one with 2 front wheels but no wheels on the 2 back legs. Well intentioned friends and family recommended a walker that they liked, or were familiar with, but it would have been a major fall hazard for my Dad if I had listened to them. If your Dad needs a walker, then he needs a specialist to tell him what kind and how best to use it. If he's Medicare age, and you're in the US, his doctor can prescribe PT visits and they may pay for the walker as well.
 My only advice is to check to make sure it fits in your vehicle. My dad’s walker wouldn’t fit in my car, so we would always have to drive my mom’s car. Thank goodness it fit in her trunk.
We bought a walker for my MIL and couldn't go for walks anymore because she was too confused on how to use it. She kept pushing it too far out in front of her where she would almost fall flat on her face due to lack of support. If we try to show her how to use it properly, she gets mad for us telling her how to do ""simple"" things. The walker ended up being more dangerous in our case.

Dementia,Dressing issues,"I'm sure others have experience with helping your LO get dressed. I typically help my Grandma because she does not remember to take her overnight pull up off and dress correctly. Some mornings she just stands there and does not try to dress herself. I'll prompt her to remove her nightgown (she has to pull it off over her head) and she will just stand there and shrug her shoulders. Then I prompt her by touching it/pulling it up slightly at the shoulders and repeating that she needs to pull it off. I don't like to remove it because she has back issues and not great range of motion in her shoulders. Then once I do pull it off she just kind of stands there. And the process just becomes more difficult because then she pretty much refuses to help. 
She has incontinence so most mornings her nightgown is wet (or will be shortly from her sitting) so I don't want her left in it. But when I'm met with her uncooperative attitude, I'm not sure what to do. Other than just getting her dressed and hoping that changes her attitude. 


How do you handle these situations?","Go get lightweight houseboats that snap all the way down the front instead of nightgowns she has to pull over her head.
Try a poise pad inside a Depends at night to hopefully contain leaks. Some people even use double Depends. I only change the shirt every other day unless it gets dirty and I let him sleep in it too. The same thing with pants but I do switch out underwear. I choose clothes that will be comfortable for sleeping in too. If you can learn quick ways to get clothes on and off that don't hurt her, it's best to just do it yourself now that she's at the stage that she can't help. For painful shoulders with poor range of motion, I learned to do ""Arm, Head, Arm"" to get on shirts. (NOT Arm, Arm, Head, or anything else.) It's quick and doesn't require certain painful shoulder movements. Also, stretchy clothing material helps. Rather than it being an attitude issue, remind yourself that she literally doesn't know the steps for getting dressed anymore and that she's just confused in general. And that old people often hurt all over and are frequently cold. This makes changing clothes undesirable and unpleasant.
She doesn't have an attitude just an inability to remember how to do things.  Seems so simple for us but so difficult for them. Maybe a dressing gown which buttons or zips up so you can undo and it drops to the floor?  Maybe use pull ups and unfasten (or tear) from the sides so those drop to the floor also?  Sometimes we just have to keep doing more as they are unable to take care of themselves.",2022-04-01 23:18:44,garden_bug,tu9618
Dementia,Dementia & disappearing arthritis pain?,"My aunt has had arthritis for years and took extra strength Tylenol in the mornings and evenings but also rubbed a numbing crème onto her knees. (She can’t take Advil or any kind of NSAID because her stomach bleeds if we’re not careful.) 


Anyway, I believe she had some kind of mini stroke, followed by some dementia symptoms but she’s doing better now that she’s taking Namenda. Strange thing. After the dementia symptoms began and before she began Namenda, she never complained about arthritis and she walked fine. Is there something about Nameda that awakens “pain pathways” in the brain and could it have reactivated her ability to feel arthritis pain?","Virtual hugs.  As a specialty visiting RN case manager, I work with severe cases of illness including various dementias.  Personally, I'm not a fan of the drugs available that allegedly help with slowing the loss of memory.  Tylenol (max of 3 grams per day if the liver is healthy; max of 2 grams a day if liver issues) is among the best mild pain relievers out there that are relatively safe.  You may want to check into Lidocaine cream or a Lidocaine patch if the current creme you are using is ineffective.  While there are studies Namenda can help with neuropathic pain, check the side effects in the references below.  I included the FAST scale as some families are not aware of where their loved one is on the scale (for Alzheimer's it is linear, for other forms of dementia we typically pick their worst area for the rating), the BEERS criteria as most doctors ARE NOT trained in that area where certain medications can be very harmful to the geratric population, and two artciles that might interest you on Namenda.

Dementia,Trying to ask a question; it’s been impossible. Maybe better luck here,"Hello I am looking for insight and opinions from those with firsthand experience. I am interested in starting an Alzheimer’s-focused nurse consultation program.

The goal of this would be to empower those in the early stages (MCI) and/or general older adults with research that can put them on the best possible path to preserve their cognitive abilities through personalized regimens backed by research. There could be testing for certain vitamin/mineral levels, gene carriers, causative agents etc.

There is a LOT of intriguing research regarding supplementation for Alzheimer’s, hypotheses for causes, etc. that most people and even providers know nothing about. A lot of these supposed interventions are also very simple to implement. Do people here with experience feel there is a need for something like this? We lost my grandmother to Alzheimer’s and while I’m not sure we would have entertained a program like this early; I am sure in retrospect we would have done everything we possibly could have.

Additionally, what are some other necessary improvements when it comes to Alzheimer’s care? Thanks in advance for your guys’ insight. Frankly, I think the current approach to Alzheimer’s is shameful; it appears the currency paradigm of care closes doors to alternatives and will make you feel stupid for asking about them.

I have NO connections to any entities and no other people except myself; Just looking for insight as I see a great need but wondering if perhaps I’m just crazy.",,2022-04-01 21:11:48,DDwightEisenhower,tu6qqs
Dementia,"Feel really guilty, yet grieving while she's alive at the same","Growing up my grandma was my one person, my support, my emotional safety net, she would call when she would get feelings that things weren't okay. Now.. she of course is a shell of that person. No empathy as I've read is common here, she gets angry a lot and then I get frustrated..

I deal with my own mental health issues, and don't have any supports besides what I had with my grandma. I moved her in with me a couple years ago and it has just gotten gradually worse but now.. it's really bad. She doesn't really answer when you say things to her, she still reads a lot pretty much all she ever does, she doesn't ask me how I'm doing anymore nor does she seem to care at all.. 

And I'm struggling a lot, I'm struggling with my own mental health because of that I lost my job. I'm struggling with the guilt I feel for not being able to treat her with the same level of care and understanding and patience that she always showed me. I try so hard but some days are so hard. I'm struggling with losing my only support person in my world all while dealing with all of this.. alone. I'm only 28, my mom's useless and isn't helping or stepping in. So it's on me all on me, everything's always on me. And I don't know how much longer I can deal with it? 

Sorry for ranting, I've lost a ton of people in my life to death, and those were far easier to deal with then this.","I understand. I just took my husband to a home, and it hurts, struggling with guilt and relief. 25 years of him being here, and now he's gone.
Check for help from your local social services and Hospice if you have it.
❤️
Please take care of yourself first, and don't feel guilty if you feel the best thing for YOU is to find a nursing home for your grandmother.

Here is why I know this is good advice: My dad did what you did for so long that it negatively affected his health and he died, too.  My mom would never have wanted that.
I understand. Just put mum into a home. My dad passed of MS 12 years ago, that was way easier.
Gods. Are you me? My grandma was my favorite person when I was growing up. The two of us understood each other at a level that no one else in my family could ever come close to. She and I spent so much time together when I was growing up, until college. And now, she’s just a husk of the woman who helped to raise me. Her voice still raises in joy whenever I call her or whenever she sees me, like she remembers that I’m her favorite and that she’s mine. But then there’s…nothing else. She won’t remember what’s happening in my life when I give her updates. She gets sad when I tell her (for the millionth time) that I live in another state. She gets even sadder and sometimes cries when I tell her (every time) that I’m settled here and have no plans of ever permanently moving back to where she is. And if things were different, if she knew who I was now, I’d 100% want to have her in my home now, either part time or permanently. But now she’s so sad and confused and angry that there’s no way I can move her to my state, and certainly no way I can have any relationship with her other than that of a caretaker.

It’s so hard to have the person you love and admire and care so deeply for just get…lost to you. I have no advice or anything to say to you. But I feel you so, so deeply. And I’m sorry you’re going through this, too!",2022-04-01 19:07:09,AlwaysHigh27,tu49am
Dementia,What am I dealing with?,"Hi everyone  
  
Question... My parents are paying me a visit (first time in years, due to Covid) and my mother is displaying very strange behaviour. With all respect, she has always been a unique character (no education, very limited social connections her entire life, never worked, anger management issues, diagnosed bipolar, chronic depression, etc...). I am grateful for the sacrifices and care she gave me. I am a successful, well-functioning adult because of her, but truth off my chest - it took me years to get my own mental health straight after some of the damage she has done, I do not love her, and although I don't want to deny her access to my family, I want to keep a healthy distance. Anyways. She doesn't strike me as massively different as usual, she is her natural self. But some of her bad temper/behaviour seems just... ""amplified"". I am starting to wonder if this is a medical condition. It is hard to explain. A couple of examples in the last 48h. 
  
She wanted to cook a roast chicken and chips for us at dinner (great!). She asked how to prepare it, I recommended she just put the chicken in the oven a 180*C for 1h30 and leave it (keeping it simple). An argument ensued (she always gets angry very quickly, it is unpleasant but nothing unusual). She wanted to know what to do for the stuffing (we don't need stuffing, it's good as it is), if she needed to cover it in butter (no, it's not a turkey, chicken is fatty enough), how to cut the chicken (no, keep it whole, we'll carve it at the end), etc... I just stuck to the simple instructions. She kept entertaining suggestions until, in the end, I lost patience, insisted on my simple steps and she reluctantly agreed to just put it as is in the oven. Anyway - fast forward half a day, my family arrive to her holiday rental for dinner. It all smells good, I go check on the chicken. She decided to turn the chicken upside down at some point during the cooking. Whatever. She left it for 2h30 (and it would still be roasting had I not asked her how long the chicken had been in the oven). When it came to taking it out of the oven, we had another argument about what cloth to use. I recommended against using a thin polyester cloth she randomly grabbed to take out the hot tray. For reference, this was not at her home, so it was not the equipment she is used to using. She insisted and went for it, the cloth started to melt immediately on the tray and I had to actually forcibly step in and intervene to remove it and stop her from burning herself. She got angry again, saying that she had lived more than me and could take a chicken out of the oven. I took over (with a thick cotton cloth), which made her cry. Oh and she had forgotten to cook the chips (so we ate the chicken while the chips were cooking).   
  
Another argument was about her laptop. It refused to turn on (blatantly, the battery was empty). She told me it went in ""security mode"" (... what?! -,-') and she needed to bring it to the repair shop (... what!!??). I tell her it just needs to be charged, and ask her where the charger is. She says the charger is in the laptop, because it is portable. We argue about chargers/batteries for a while, she gets angry again. I show her the charger, connect it to the laptop, put it in her hands, and tell her to just plug it in and leave the laptop be for a while. She tells me she doesn't know how to do that, gets angry, goes back to ""the laptop is in security mode"". I tell her to plug it in and that she knows how to plug something in. She gets angrier about me being ""unhelpful"" but as I walk off, she reluctantly complies. Lo and behold - after 15min the laptop just boots normally. We discuss further (calmly this time, yay), and she tells me she regularly goes to the local computer shop and pay $40 to get her laptop out of ""security mode"". Yes, I want to kill the shop owners.  
  
Anyway, I could go on. It is like this all. the. time. My mom has always got angry quickly her entire life, I lived my childhood in-between shouts and arguments. But it kind of feels it is worse, it now happens for everything. And I mean EVERY thing. She argues about opening the car door. She can't peel carrots properly, gets angry when I peel them further when she is ""done"". When my young son greets her with a white blouse, green scrubs and a stethoscope around the neck, she asks me what he is dressed up as (and gets angry when I am surprised she can't see it's a doctor costume - ""how am I supposed to know"", she says). I don't know if it is me being shocked by her attitude because I have lived a long time with no contact with her or if she has got worse. But it is exhausting. It is impossible to have a conversation on anything that is remotely non-basic, it goes completely over her head and she just doesn't understand what it is about. My dad confirms the type of interactions is his daily life. He is numb to it. I only admire his patience explaining the simplest of things again, and again, and again, in spite of being shouted at in the rudest of ways. I can't stay calm like he does. His relationship with her is clearly beyond repair, but he stays at his post, sticks to his principles/duties like a boss and won't leave her despite all she does to him. She never worked, has no pension - if he leaves she is absolutely f*cked, which he will not allow. I am in awe about his ability to remain steadfast.
  
My parents live abroad, I can't do much with their medical support. But I wonder. My dad says she had multiple brain scans, and they were all OK. Is what I describe dementia? Or is it just who she is and I forgot how bad she was? How do I know the difference? How should I behave?  
  
I am sorry if this is not the right forum, I just don't know where to look or who to turn to. I would appreciate any advice or help.
  
Thanks","Maybe the arguing and getting mad is just her same old self, maybe not. What really concerns me from your story is that she can’t figure things out. She doesn’t know that you have to plug in a laptop when the battery is going down. She doesn’t remember that there is a cord to charge it and somehow thinks it magically charges itself. She doesn’t question paying $40 on a regular basis because the laptop is in security mode (the computer repair shop may telling her the truth and charging her a service fee to discourage her from bringing it in constantly), she doesn’t know how to plug a cord into an outlet, she doesn’t know how to do some basic cooking, she doesn’t understand what is appropriate for handling a hot baking pan. 

Assuming she wasn’t, well, extremely unintelligent her whole life, this seems to be a drastic change. You should ask your dad point blank if the doctors have said anything about dementia or cognitive impairment/decline. They may have a diagnosis and just aren’t wanting to tell you about it. If they haven’t gotten a diagnosis, urge your dad to write down examples of her behaviors and cognitive difficulties and share that list with her doctor. I fear something is amiss and if there isn’t a diagnosis yet, they need to get one.
I think you're probably noticing actual changes in your mom, assuming when you were growing up she managed to cook safely etc. When your dad says her brain scans all came back fine, brain scans aren't the only diagnostic tool but if he's inclined to think nothing's changed with your mom, it makes sense that he would leave things there. None of us can say, ""it's dementia,"" but I will say my mom, who has dementia, went through a period where she would just explode at the smallest stuff, like not being able to do something on her computer. If I were you, I would urge your dad to get your mom back to her doctor. If she's taking anything for her diagnosed issues, maybe something's going wrong with that (e.g. a drug interaction), or maybe she stopped taking meds.",2022-04-01 18:57:44,Derp_Animal,tu41s4
Dementia,Hard Day,"I just need to vent, guys. I care for my FIL who has dementia. Hard days typically means wandering the house and telling stories that only make half sense. He's tried to wander off, but we've since installed the toddler things on the door knobs. Today it's 75F and gorgeous out. I left the big door open that has the child locks on it and just have the screen door shut. He comes out of his room with his cane and is trying to leave. He has a story about the preacher, his wife, and the neighbor and some incoherent things. I redirect him by changing the subject and things are good. He comes back minutes later and tries to leave again. This time I shut the door and try to redirect his attention again. It only made things worse and he raised his cane at me. He didn't hit me, but I really thought he was going to. The emptiness in his eyes broke my heart. I just hate this disease. Everything about it. I was able to get him calmed down almost immediately, so it wasn't a full melt down. But damnit... It's. Just. Hard. Some. Days. I'm sorry if this is rambling and jumbled, but I just needed to let it out. Everything is fine now. He asked for eggs five minutes later and probably has no idea what happened or just has no empathy. Maybe both idk. Anyways thanks for reading guys.","That sounds really frustrating and emotionally exhausting. I'm sorry, hopefully tomorrow is a better day.
❤️
That had to be so draining.  It’s hard- it’s like supervising a toddler but it’s someone much bigger.  And it’s sad knowing they were once somebody completely different and capable.

Are you able to get any time to yourself?  This disease is horrible- venting does help but it’s a tough job you are doing.
Draining and exhausting. I'm sorry you're dealing with this.
Yes, the total lack of empathy is so hard to deal with. They become a total shell of their former selves and I wonder sometimes if that is not a good thing for them.  My husband seems to have no feelings at all except for the occasional burst of anger.  The slack face and vacant look is so hard to see every day. Hang in there.

Dementia,Tips for teaching medical alert button?,"We just transitioned my mom, who has mild to severe dementia, to a assisted living facility. The facility didn’t think she’s at memory care level, so she’s starting out in the regular assisted living area but with very high care level.

Care while she’s in her room is modeled around a call button hanging around her neck, coupled with periodic check ins and motion sensors.

Any tips on how to help her remember the button is there?

We’re only a day in but I have to continuously remind her the call device is around her neck and that she should use it. It may be partly because we’re taking an approach of being around the first few days to facilitate the transition. So she hasn’t had a trial by fire situation where she’s alone for a extended period, particularly overnight. I’m worried about a bad experience of needing something and forgetting the button, and she sees she’s alone, so she panics. That could sour the seemingly happy transition she’s been having. 

It’s a facility that specializes in dementia so it must be possible. I plan on asking them on this topic, but wondered people’s experiences. I understand  I need to learn to trust them, but it’s scary.","We started my dad out at a memory care place like that. It was Assisted Living and they assured us that the button around his neck was any time he had any questions not just for emergencies. After he got settled the first day we left and of course dad did get confused at one point.

He pressed the button and someone came but the person that came was the maintenance man and the maintenance man was angry at my dad :( He told him to NEVER push the button unless there was a dire emergency! Dad would never push that button again no matter what. We ended moving him out after just a few days because it was clearly not the right place.

Pop in at different times day and night. Find out the people that are interacting with your loved one. A lot of these places are meant to make US feel better and so on the surface they look wonderful. How things actually work out is sometimes a lot different. Even if it's not bad, it may be unsuitable for your loved one's needs.

I would immediately put a nanny cam of some sort in the apartment or the room that your loved one is in. There are some you can get that are very discreet or you could get one that allows you to talk back and forth with your loved one in case they have a meltdown.

It's really a blessing to find a facility that can care for your loved one properly. Hopefully you do find one soon and just remember that even though things are going well one day, the next day there's different people on shift right? You can't leave your guard down once you feel comfortable that they are comfortable oh, the staff and administrators still need to see you and know that you're on top of things. 

One of my dad's doctors was very blunt. He said ""the staff knows whose family comes to see them and cares about them. If they feel you don't value and care about your loved one, why should they""? 

Make sure they see you as often as possible even if it's just for 30 minutes every day at lunch time. A lot of times with dementia patients it's more important for the staff to see you than it is for your loved ones to see you. Facts!
I would have her start using it while you're there, I'm an occupational therapist and that's what I used to do with my cognitively impaired patients in home health. 

Gee I don't know how we find out what's for dinner, let's practice using your button to ask!

Hey let's practice using your button. Press your button and someone will come help take you to breakfast.

Or whatever the need is. It takes repetition for new learning. And a few signs posted around can also help if she is still noticing or reading things like that.

And it may just not work for her to learn something new. My mom is in assisted living and she just couldn't get it. At first she knew she had to wear it, but thought she was supposed to wear it only when she left her apartment! Then she wore it but forgot why. I just noticed this week that she doesn't wear it at all.

The most important thing is don't count on her being able to call for help.

This reminds me I should probably review what the call buttons in the bathroom are for. I try to do that with her periodically. Sometimes she knows, sometimes not.
Ooof. Teaching anything is rough. Remembering lifelong behaviors is hard enough!

Mom just said she had to go to the bathroom. It took the aid about 10 minutes to get her to even relax her legs a little to sit DOWN on the toilet!

Then she had a rough time getting her to remember she's on the toilet and it's time to stand up and move on.

I hate to sound negative, but if she doesn't already know how to do something, I wouldn't waste my time trying to teach it to her. Even if she already knew, depending on her situation on any given day, you never know if you can reliably count on her knowing how to use it still.

ETA: I think there are some sensors that self-detect a fall based on quick movements typical in falling down and some kind of mechanism inside the device. I would look into those.",2022-04-01 17:01:50,-emanresUesoohC-,tu1fvm
Dementia,Why is dementia so weird?,"Something that I observed over the 2 years that my grandma had symptoms is that from September until March her dementia is worse. From march to August she seems so fine. She remembers most things and is in a good mood almost all of the time. How is this possible? Also in the mornings she feels more confused but late in the day is way better.
Do some of you have similar observations or is it just me?","My FIL is worse in the winter months, I've noticed. Mornings are good in warmer months. Nights are always 50/50 no matter what. Seems night time is really triggering for him.
I think Seasonal Affective Disorder hits those with dementia especially hard.  They also don't get outside much.  I've noticed that getting them out in the sunshine often benefits them greatly.
Depending where you are, it's probably the break in routines during the summer months. I know we try to get my MIL outside as soon as weather permits because we run out of things to do all winter. Although it's said that it's short term memory issues with dementia, I've observed that even if they can't remember what they just ate or if they just went to the bathroom, they remember the ""activities"" you've tried to keep them occupied and resent doing the same old things. Getting outside opens up a lot of new options.
Possibly more vitamin d in those months since the sun is out longer.
That's really interesting. I wonder if the sunshine has something to do with it? My dad always seems better (and by better I mean just confused instead of completely incoherent) if I can get him to go outside, I thought it was fresh air and exercise but maybe it is sunshine.
I put up a youtube channel journaling my mother's cognitive decline..if you could all please subscribe to her channel, I would be forever grateful..

Winter magnifies the sundowning issue since in the winter, effectively two-thirds of the waking day is dark. My grandmother definitely benefitted from hanging out on the patio for a couple hours every day in the summer. And then she got very loopy in the winter. Most of her bad judgments that led to injuries, happened between October and December.
Melatonin helps, vitamin D, turning on all the lights by like 3 pm, and putting on SAD lamps during the ""daytime"" may help.

Now it's getting worse and he doesn't recognise her more often than he does, and he locked her out of the house and then the police took him to hospital.

He's distraught when anyone suggests he has or might hurt my mother but it's because of the problem that he doesn't recognise her.

Unfortunately, this conversation will be had over and over and over again. You all will get better at navigating it as time goes on. A short statement followed by changing the subject helps. “The doctors are trying ti figure out the best treatment for some problems you had/a fall you took/and pain you told us about/whatever.

Dementia,Lack of Empathy,"I know by now that nothing that my dad with dementia does should shock me, but have others dealt with a lack of empathy from their LO? 

My mom was listening to her messages, and she had a voicemail from one of her dear friends asking my mom to come rescue friend, because friend didn't know where she was. My mom could here the all too familiar sound of a oxygen flowing from a nasal canula in the background. To make a long story short, her friend was in the hospital with Covid and was experiencing delirium. We were familiar because we went through the same thing in 2020 with my dad and he almost died. So understandably, my mom was very upset. My dad got mad at the whole situation saying that her friend was rude to call and upset my mom like that. He kept saying that she never should have called and kept her business to herself. She died. My dad was still mad at her for calling. This is someone that my dad would have also considered a close friend.

More recently, my mom's childhood best friend died suddenly of a heart attack. My dad has know this person for 55+ years. She's the godmother of some of my parents' children. We considered her family. When we found out, I went to my dad and told him while he was watching TV. He didn't say anything. So I repeated myself. He shrugged his shoulders and turned up his hands in the ""Yes, I heard you. What do you want me to do about it?"" look. 

It's shocking to see him so indifferent. Like seriously, not the least bit sad, sympathetic, surprised, or shocked. I got more of a reaction from him when I told him dinner was ready.

Edit: Thanks to everyone sharing their stories. It’s been really cathartic for me.","Not sure what type of dementia your dad has but my dad has fronto temporal lobe and although he's never been an empathetic guy, he has zero empathy now. Apparently it's a feature of that type of dementia. It's hard to watch.
Lack of empathy/becoming very selfish are very common with dementia, as the damage changes the brain their world shrinks to a very small focus: themselves.
I’ve seen the same sort of behavior off and on with my dad (post-stroke dementia). In 2018, my mom had surgery for cancer, and she came home with about 20 staples in her abdomen. She sat in my dad’s recliner because it was more comfortable. He came in and made her get out of his chair, then couldn’t figure out why she left the room in tears. Also, she was nauseated from chemo, and the smell of the bacon he cooked each morning gagged her. I asked him to quit eating bacon for her sake and his response was “I’M 82 YEARS OLD AND WILL EAT WHAT I GODDAMN WANT!” She died an angry woman. His selfishness makes me livid sometimes. It’s so frustrating to see the behavior changes, knowing they’ll just get worse.
I've seen that quite a bit in other patients where my mom was. People who I know were sweet, caring, empathetic people before just had no patience or understanding for anyone any longer.
My grandmother’s diagnosis isn’t confirmed yet and she’s never been the most “warm” or loving person but her lack of empathy (as well as general social skills like not talking over someone) are definitely more intense than before her decline.

She really lashed out at me verbally the other day and that’s how I found this sub. I cried for most of the day about her comments. It’s one of the more difficult symptoms IMO.
My grandma has not officially been diagnosed yet but she’s a old fashion country woman, could be the sweetest most loving lady there is but she has a bit of a spicy attitude. I believe she’s in the early stages of it and she has been so hateful and plain out rude. She has told a few people to end their life, will call you every name in the book, tell you how lazy you are when your cleaning/cooking doing the in general care to help her make life easier for her. It’s hard to deal with a lot of the times but I remind myself take it with a grain of salt and to remember the good times we had because she wasn’t always hateful. Honestly after dealing with it I’ll go take a shower or run the water and cry get it out of my system and I get right back out there. What else can I do?
One of the first things I noticed about my dad's increasing dementia was that he in fact was too emotional, and his emotions swung wildly. Then it's like it reached a kind of apex and after that he experienced a slow shift towards apathy. One time, we were on this beautiful trip through Zion National park and he just couldn't care less, he was so over it. I think he was just really tired and maybe it was just too much for his brain to process. I know that with a healthy brain he would have been really in awe of the beauty of the area. Sometimes, I feel terribly guilty cause I snapped on him during that trip (over something else he said) and wish I could take it back. It was the last trip we ever took as a family together
My dad is just the opposite. He cries over every little thing. Anti-depressants have helped.
My uncle has vascular dementia and if I'm in pain(migraines or cramps) then that's too bad for me since he doesn't understand enough to empathize. It really sucks I'm hate that this is happening and you're dealing with this too OP😢 From my point of view as his caregiver it can be hard for me to empathize what he's going through on days when he's having a hard time and pushing me to my last nerve. Its hard to keep in mind why they call this the shrinking brain disease. They really can't help how they are. I'm very sorry OP.
The frontal lobes (front of brain) control things like empathy, impulsiveness etc. Damage there can result in personality changes. My LO still has some empathy left (more than your dad) but it's diminished. 

Sorry you're dealing with it OP.
My mom’s lack of empathy has been very hard to get used to. Being a bit more conscious of how other people feel, it almost feels like an attack until I remember it’s not her fault. She’s still got a bunch of great qualities, but empathy just isn’t there anymore.
Before my grandfather passed away, his dementia got progressively worse and my father became in charge of his finances. Every year, when tax season comes around, my grandpa would have specific demands, and it would frustrate my dad to the point of arguing with him. My grandpa always looked the other way and was more interested in his money. Money was the one thing grandpa worried the most and often believed he was low on money, despite having a comfortable level of finances. 

So in short, dementia messes with emotions and the person we love would change dramatically.
My own dad says terrible things— “my mother is a whore, my brothers are not smart and they don’t need to be in the will etc” in response to very very slight insults.  Lizard brain just takes over.  Empathy is for our front brain. Reaction is for our lizard brain and that’s where he lives. 

I am sorry you are going through this.
Yes, that part of the brain that considers the world through other people's eyes, literally is one of the first to start shrinking.
As with neurotypicals, we all have a limit to how much grief and empathy we can expend before we crack open and lose it. The heart can only take so much before it hits self-preservation mode. 

Neurotypicals have more ability to filter, offer an appropriate response, even when they're not really feeling it. It's a reciprocal, social bonding imperative deeply baked into human survival strategies evolved over millenia—I'll express empathy for you, and will expect you to empathize with me when I need it. 

From what I see with my own partner (and what I've read about dementia), she's very self-absorbed, anhedonic and has flat affect at surprising times. Her ex died a year or so ago; they had become distant, but her response was ""meh.""",2022-04-01 14:14:49,WinterBourne25,ttxiz6
Dementia,The doctors don’t see it,"New to the group. Forgive me if there are resources here covering this. If so, pointers would be appreciated. 

My father just turned 78 and his memory has been failing for at least 8-10 years, but initially it was just forgetfulness. About 6 years ago he had the first of several episodes of what were initially diagnosed as transient global amnesia. He would seem fine, but think it was years prior. In 2016 he thought it was 2012. (We we’re a tiny bit jealous, as we wished it wasn’t 2016, but so it goes.) He was oddly calm about it, but would act like he had time traveled without knowing it… for about 5 minutes, and then reset to the beginning. He went to neurologists, he had tests. They told him it was nothing. But it happened several times over the next two years, and meanwhile his memory got worse and worse. 

Then he began to have seizures. I think that it was seizures all along, but he crashed his car for the first time 3.5 years ago. That time he convinced everyone that he fell asleep. The next crash was 2 years ago, and that time the paramedics witnessed a seizure. Not grand mal. He often seems awake and agitated. Sometimes combative. His license was suspended and he went on meds. And he thought he was fine. But his memory got worse and worse. And whenever he sees a doctor he just charms them, and they never diagnose any cognitive decline. So he thinks he’s fine. 

Right before New Years he totaled his brand new truck. This time he had a grand mal in the ER. I forbade him to drive again, and he agreed, but reluctantly. I went to the neurologist with him this time. Once again all scans were clear. They changed his meds and seem willing to let him drive after 6 months. BUT he can’t remember when he has seizures. Unless he crashes a car he doesn’t really seem to believe that they happen. And now he is behaving on a day to day basis like he has dementia. He nearly burned down my stepsister’s house the other day trying to light a broken wood stove 1 hour after being reminded not to use it. Many other examples. 

The thing is, I don’t live very nearby. I only see him occasionally. I have arranged to legally take charge of financial stuff, but I can’t be there all the time. And none of his doctors seem to think there’s anything wrong except seizures. How can I approach them in a way that they will take seriously when he is so invested in convincing them that there’s no issue? Everything is landing on my stepsister, who is also dealing with her mother’s physical decline. Especially since now neither of them can drive. I am really getting worried that he’s unable to care for himself.","It's really common for dementia patients to be able to mask their behavior for a while in front of strangers. They pay attention to things much more intently when out being observed. If someone's going to the doctor with him, take him out for a while beforehand, shopping, out to eat where he has to interact with the wait staff, etc.. That ""public behavior"" well is only so deep and if he's out in public using it up before the doctor's appointment, hopefully they'll see what you see.  It worked with my mom.
I am so sorry you are going through all of this.  My first thought is you need new doctors.  I have gone through 4 docs and now have one that listens to me.  Also a neuro psych examination seems called for.  This is an exam that runs for several hours where your father is tested in a number of a different areas from comprehension to memory etc.  He is a danger to himself and others so making sure he never drives again is pretty important.  It also sounds like maybe, since both of your parents aren't well, that they be moved into an assisted living home. Caring for someone with dementia takes it's toll and your sister is now caring for both parents. Moving them into assisted living means they will be safe and cared for and peace of mind for both you and your step sister.
I'm probably butchering the term but someone in this sub essentially called them ""unreliable self reporters"". Which is true. My grandma would go to the doctor and be asked questions that she thought she was answering accurately. ""Do you nap through the day?"" Her response- ""No."" My response- ""Yes you do. Usually at least an hour."" *insert shocked face*

The other comments are spot on. 
Every state is different, but if he has another accident you may be able to get law enforcement to revoke his license. A friend of mine had that happen in their family circle.
I lived through a three-year nightmare of trying to get my wife diagnosed. I used a minor fender bender she was in as the excuse to keep going back. She was referred to a neurologist who specialized in trauma injuries (his practice was mainly young sports related concussions). I often wonder if I had first found her a neurologist that specialized in dementia would the process have been less painful.
Document, document, document is my first go-to. Date, time, place and as objective, clinical a description as you can muster, telling ""what happened"" without try to editorialize ""why it happened.""

If you haven't already contacted your Area Council on Aging, consider doing so. They may be able to help you strategize.
In California, where I live, doctors are “mandated reporters” to the DMV if someone has dementia or seizures.",2022-04-01 03:49:06,91slugs,ttla04
Dementia,My Grandmother thinks everyday is New Years,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting to this subreddit, and I’m hoping I can get some advice on how to handle this. So my grandmother, who is 78, has had dementia for about 10 years now, and she’s a pretty “typical” dementia patient. She has gotten significantly worse over the years, and she now requires around the clock care from feeding to bathing and everything in between. It’s certainly been hard to adjust to, as she only started living with my parents and me about 5 years ago. 

It fell to me at first to help her around whenever I would get home from school as my parents work full time jobs, but back then she was much more capable and didn’t really require much help. Now we’ve struggled to find her a caregiver who can accommodate her since she does not speak English, and it’s been up to our extended family to provide care most of the time since no one of us can afford to always be with her. Luckily, we’ve recently found a care giver who speaks our native language and is able to  be with her most days when we can’t.

Now New Years is a very major holiday where we’re from (Albania) and it’s always been my grandmother’s favorite to boot. About 1 month ago she seemingly woke up and decided it was New Years and kept going around asking everyone what the plan is and where we’re going, what we’re eating, where are the gifts, etc. She has had delusions in the past, but they never stuck stuck around, and we figured this one would be no different, but then, the next day, she had the same conviction, that it was New Years. This happened the next day and the next and the next day, and it’s still ongoing. It’s gotten to be a big problem, as since she thinks it’s New Years everyday, she expects there to always be festivities and gangs of hoodlums roaming around like it was when she was younger in the old country, and she always becomes extremely anxious when anyone leaves the house because of this, as she fears for our safety. She never used to mind, so long as someone stayed with her, but now if she realizes anyone is gone, her anxiety causes her to become agitated and lash out constantly. 

We’ve tried telling her it wasn’t New Years at first, but that went as poorly as you might expect, then we tried giving her a calendar to mark the days, but instead of using it whenever we put it out for her and cross off dates she just hides it somewhere in her room, and even when we find it and show her it doesn’t change her assertion that today is New Years. She does always trust her phone, but even when staring right at the date on it she still won’t believe it. 

My parents and I are at a total loss for how to move forward, as her belief that everyday is New Years had put serious stress on us and her, and it is starting to become debilitating. Do we just have to accept this is a part of everyday life from now on? My theory (and hope) is that it’s mainly due to the weather, and once the trees get their leaves back and it’s not cold and cloudy everyday this will end. I would really appreciate some advice on this from anyone willing to give some.

TL;DR

The first two paragraphs are skippable, but otherwise the title tells all you need to know.","I have small grandkids I care for and a husband with early MCI. The kids get over excited about events to come (birthdays, holidays, party invites, etc.), building it up in their minds and asking every day if today is the event.

Is it possible to let your love one think New Years is in her near future, tomorrow or next week perhaps, and ask her to help “plan” for it to keep her mind active? 
Example: 
What will we wear?
Shop online for possible foods, look up recipes together, cut pictures out of magazine relating to the event as a wish board, maybe watch a movie or cartoon on the subject, etc.?

The date may not come soon, but she may enjoy planning & plotting the event and have less stress about the current state of your leaving the house?

Not sure if this is helpful. It works with kids with no concept of time, and the basic “planning” really helps my husband feel part of the event.
My mom had dementia. I let her believe whatever she wanted. 
If she thought we were going to do something, I’d say “we’re going to do that in a just a little bit” or “yes we are definitely getting ready to do that” and she would be satisfied for awhile. I did that all the time constantly. Get her on hospice care if you can. My mom had good insurance so hospice was really great. They gave my mom anxiety meds and that really helped her calm down. She would forget my dad had passed, and then re-remembered it over and over, causing herself (and me) a great deal of distress.
I had to get therapy while I was my moms caregiver because it was so so difficult. I feel for you. It’s extremely taxing. 
(My mom passed 10 months ago, here at my house. Me and her nurse were standing next to her bed while she breathed her last. It was a really hard journey and you have my sincere love for you as you go thru this.)
Dementia robs the afflicted of their reason. You will not convince her it is not New Years for a couple of reasons: first, dementia confuses the sufferer and they know things are ""not right"". So they are very suspicious of everyone's motives around them. They think someone is playing a trick on them, but they just haven't figured it out yet. Second, they do not arrive at the decision that it is New Years via a logical path of reason. They just ""know it"". And there is no way to counter that.

With dementia, every day the person can change. Significantly.

Your ONLY role is to make each day as comfortable and pleasant as you can.

So when she says it is New Years, you go along with it. ""Yes! What is your favorite thing about New Years?"" or ""What was your favorite New Years celebration?"" or ""What did you always want to do on New Years, but never did?""

All of these questions will make the dementia sufferer happy. They will happily reminisce about their best memories and tell stories of their favorite times.

... and then forget it all later.

And then you can repeat it.

Your grandmother will have a lovely time remembering great times in her past, and it hurts no one for her to think it is New Years. You don't have to tell her it isn't, because it doesn't matter if it is New Years or not. Just ask leading questions - what would you like to do? - and let the person live happily in their best memories.",2022-04-01 02:14:03,Clydo28,ttjxd0
Dementia,I hate having to lie to her (follow up to the s**t hitting the fan),"Have managed with the doctors to keep my wife in the hospital here in San Diego for more days while searing for a facility in Arizona. 

We seemed to have found a good one but she so easily melts down (even after a week on Olanzapine) that I can’t tell her we’ll be going straight there and not home. 

So I have to lie and I hate it. And yes, I know it’s necessary for her safety, but that doesn’t make it any easier. 

Not just a vent for me. How have others handled this?  She will really blow up when we actually get there, so much that she might not want any of us (me and our two adult children) to see her there at all. She already blames our daughter for  all that’s happened (see prior thread). 

Any experience and advice on this?

Thanks","You tell her she is there temporarily until she gets back to good health. Doesn’t matter how unrealistic that actually is
Little white lies are appropriate with dementia patients. We had to do it with our dad, we kept him at home. Bribes also work, soft chocolate chip cookies worked miracles. Perhaps a couple low dose Ativan. We used it for sundowning and anxiety 
It’s hard
I'm curious if you often travel with your wife. Is there a possibility that being in a new space is throwing her off her game.

I'm glad you were able to steal a little more time before moving her again. I'm glad your kids are there to support you and you aren't dealing with this alone. Fingers crossed you find a great facility in AZ where she can be comfortable and she doesn't hold it against you for too long. I wish I had better advice for you.
Do you finally have a diagnosis now? Her medication options really depend on her preliminary diagnosis. For example, in Lewy Body Dementia, olanzapine is contraindicated. 

I’m surprised they can’t give your wife some more sedating medications such as Ativan. Ativan isn’t good for the brain of dementia patients or really any senior. However, it’s frequently used in situations like this. I might have said this in a previous response to one of your posts. 

You’re not lying. It’s called compassionate deception. You could go as far as saying that you aren’t well and need to stop “at the ER” (chest pains should work) or your family friend is there and you would like both of you to visit. 

Don’t take any luggage in with her to the AZ facility. You can deliver that after she is admitted. 

I’m really sorry you’re going through this.
Don’t think if it as telling lies. Don’t think of anything but protecting the one you love. She has a terminal illness. You are saving her a little bit of pain. Plus the fewer fights that cause her distress in the moment and you long term pain, the better. Sadly your world has changed. Adapting is the only way to get through this without everyone falling apart. Good luck. As you know this is super hard. Give yourself space.  You’re doing the impossible.
She is very stubborn and when I say how the drs want it, she claims never to have seen one. The stubbornness is not new - it’s just on steroids now. 

And yes, we have traveled regularly, but all she wants now is to go home. 

And a weird quirk - before this, at home, she’d be asking about our two cats every five minutes. She has barely mentioned them in the last nearly two weeks since the big meltdown. Thinking a small stroke affecting that area ? Was planning on one of the cats joining her in the facility, but I won’t unless she expresses interest. Can always find some high school kid to scoop and so forth.
One of the first things I realized and accepted after my dad's diagnosis was that I was going to have to lie to him.

It feels wrong, but I don't have any problem rationalizing it.
The facility will help you if she balks at the door. If she isn't under a Guardianship though, they cannot ""make"" her come in, she has to go willingly.

If there is only the POA, that means she is legally still allowed to make her own decisions. Refusing to take treatments/enter a facility/anything... they cannot force it and won't allow you to forcibly bring her either.

Don't try to ""prep"" her... imo that creates a lot of stress and she'll have time to worry, quiz you, sense your own stress/worry. You guys will fight. 

Only answer questions she brings up, don't try to be proactive in that sense. Treat things as if you feel it's just normal. 

You tell her you are ""touring the place the doctor wants her to go to for recovery/rehab/whatever..."" Tell her you want to have a look because YOU think it's best to follow what the Dr says but you want to see how SHE feels, after taking the tour. Make her feel it's her decision but only after she takes the tour.

IF she indicates she's afraid you are leaving her there, point out that if she were staying, you would have brought her overnight things/luggage/cat/whatever...

At some point, you WILL have to leave without her. Staff can distract her while you step out to ""go to the bathroom"" or ""go to the vending machine for snacks"" or to ""take a call"" (that you arranged to get) from someone. She will be mad and you will cry. 

Don't look back and don't go back for at least a few days or so. Talk on the phone with her, tell her you are busy but will be there ""soon"", blame the Dr! Give her goals such as ""he says you get discharged once the rehab is over/you balance for walking is better/you eat/your blood work improves..."" It puts the control back in her court and she'll feel better because it gives hope of leaving but only under certain circumstances. 

Good luck, above all operate in LOVE... she will feel it even if you think she doesn't. Remember that for you, it's temporary pain and anguish. For her it's permanent, dehumanizing, lonely, and terrifying. 

The only blessing is that the point WILL come when she doesn't remember current events more than just a few moments at a time.
A victory for the moment. The Hearing Exqmijer granted the 14 days (11 left) in order to have a proper discharge plan. Of course my wife thinks she “won”. Now we can get the facility work all done. But of course when we drive up…
My sympathies. My dad eventually got to the point of extreme emotional instability and outbursts, often aggressive ones, so we stopped telling him things/the truth. When we placed him in memory care, we told him the doctors were worried about him falling and said he needed to be in rehab until he was stronger. He kinda understood, although at that point he was veeeeeeeeery confused, and once we got him there he went along calmly enough. It sounds like your wife is more likely to question what's happening, but I still think that lying to her is justified - you know that this is necessary, but she cannot and will not understand or respond rationally, so you have to do what you have to do to make this happen without triggering behavior which will endanger her, you, or others.

Fact is, they just can't control their own behavior anymore, so we have to head them off at the pass and avoid doing things which will trigger unavoidable outbursts. No other way to do it.
We share stories about the good outcome of bending the truth...I'm sure everyone has as many stories where being honest backfired and caused pain and grief for everyone involved.
Therapeutic fibbing is a thing. It's okay to fib, especially if it's for their benefit and safety. As for when you get there, with moving mum into her memory care facility, we've said it's a trial run for a week and she's happy with that. She asks often when it's done but we just keep saying in a few days then redirect the conversation.",2022-04-01 01:47:43,barryaz1,ttjicj
Dementia,Need help getting dementia treatment,"Any ideas appreciated! This month I (clinical researcher and prior MRI training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family). 

It began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed TIA?). Since then, she’s been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. PCP told her to follow up in a year! I told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then I read through all the reports: MRI shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says “Alzheimer’s”.  

BUT she was ultimately diagnosed as “mild neurological disorder” and won’t get meds until she becomes severe. My friend said he was told there’s nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so I’ve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. What else can be done for her that I’m missing?? Thank you!!","Where in the world is this lady that they're denying her meds in the early stages? That's insane! That's when you want to slow progression, if possible. Once they're more severe, it seems almost cruel to slow the progression.
A spinal tap resulting in cognitive recovery sounds like they were fishing for a normal pressure hydrocephalus diagnosis.  Cognitive recovery after a spinal tap is almost unheard of though.  How was this assessed, if you know? Also, a brain MRI does not detect Tau.  If she had a spinal tap that would have been a good opportunity to test her for Alzheimer's markers including Tau.


If she had neuropsych testing that indicated Alzheimer's disease and a neurologist  eval said Alzheimer's then it sounds like her diagnosis is Alzheimer's and the neurologists can provide the appropriate medications now.  There is no protocol to hold off medications until the dementia becomes more advanced that defeats the entire purpose.

Unfortunately there's not a whole lot that can be done.  Home health aids can be prescribed to visit the home and assist with activities of daily living.  As far as medications goes  cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are all that are available.  If she is having behavioral changes and anxiety that could be managed by the neurologist as well.  

It sounds like you are doing all the right things!
New doctor. Now. They’ll never get the right resources until she has a diagnosis
Not a doctor. Learning about dementia on the fly as my partner is newly dx'd. Have docs considered NPH? The headache, temporary spinal tap recovery and lack of tau lead me to ask. I've seen them mentioned in various readings; again, not a doctor.

Dementia,How do I support my dad through this?,"My mom has LBD and has pretty impaired cognitive functioning. She’s either angry with him for doing something she’s hallucinated, happy but can’t hold much of a conversation, or completely dissociated. 

I recently moved a few states away for grad school and have no idea what more I can do. We FaceTime daily but that can only do so much. Flights back are so expensive and taking time off of school isn’t really an option right now. 

I know he is incredibly drained and lonely even if he doesn’t always admit it, and I want to think that there’s something more I can do to help him. Thank you in advance for any advice❤️","I bet that what you are doing already is helping more than you realize. Knowing that his child is on a good life path and doing well has got to relieve a burden for him.  AND, to also be able to Facetime with you daily AND that you care about his wellbeing, are willing to listen, and you understand the enormity of the situation he is in - that is worth A LOT!
Keep up the texts/SMS. Honestly there’s not a whole lot you can do, til he decides for himself to put your mum into full time care, and even then the worry doesn’t stop, but at least he’ll have a few moments of peace.
Do some research for him:  are there senior centers in his area, many have respite and/or day care programs which would give him a break.  Is it possible to bring in a caregiver a couple of times a week.  Is it time to look for placing your mother in a facility that can take care of her needs and give relief to your dad?  Face time is great but you don't really get the true flavor of what he is going through.  You need to get him help because taking care of your mother comes at a huge cost for him.
My mom also has LBD. Dad & I are her caretakers. One thing I think is important is having friends or family visit and just spend some social time with either one of them, or both. 

If you know any of your parents' friends well enough, reach out to them and gently encourage them to visit, if it's an option health- and pandemic-wise. I think social isolation is a huge problem for caregivers as well as for the patient, and someone coming to visit either one of them will give your dad a mental break, and maybe a physical break if they want to sit and be with your mom a while. 

When the weather is nice enough so we can sit outside, we regularly invite friends over, and my mom has such great friends that they'll also just invite themselves over - obviously they check with us and see what times are good, but they don't wait for us to call. And it just makes such a difference in my mom's mood, and gives my dad a break, either because he can do something else for a while, or because he joins them and has someone he can talk to who doesn't have dementia. 

I think people are often reluctant to extend invitations because dementia is so unpredictable and what if she's having a terrible day and insults her guest or something? But most older people have some experience with dementia already - maybe because their parent had it when they were younger, and probably because other people in their social circle or family now have it - and even if they don't, good friends understand that it's difficult and not to have expectations. My mother's friends have been immensely patient and loving, coming by to talk with her even when she's not making any sense at all. (Her best friend recently spent a couple hours with her and told me that my mom talked a lot - she said ""it was in German so I didn't understand a word, but I don't think that matters, what matters is listening to her."" What a friend.) 

Also if you haven't already, ask your dad if they have long-term care insurance and what the policy covers, because a lot of those will cover home health aides, and even if it's just one day a week it makes an *enormous* difference. My parents have the insurance but it took my dad a long time to use it, I think because he felt like we *should* be able to do this on our own, and I had to push him to get it, that's why I think it's probably worth getting specific about it.
Our dad died from dementia in June. There are five siblings and we rotated every4-5 days to take care of him at home, which was about the max we could do. Respectfully, Caregiver burn out is real. Taking care of your mother alone is stressful and she may outlive him. I’ve been there and it can be brutal. It does not get easier or better, it gets worse. A proper assessment of her medical condition and how to provide the best care for her without over working your dad.
After dealing with 5 kids taking care of our dad for 4 months after a heart related hospital stay made his dementia must worse, I would implore anyone to try a good memory care unit in an assisted living facility if possible.

I understand the desire to keep loved ones in the family home, especially for a spouse, but the quality of care you can give at a facility exceeded what we could do as a family. Medication or bathroom trips would take us 30 minutes, while it was minutes in the facility. All the time fighting to get him to eat for us and he started feeding himself when seeing others doing it at the facility.  He was improving until an extended hospital stay for a minor incident unfortunately lead to his passing. 

The best is actually being able to spend time as a family member instead of as a care taker. Money will be a huge factor, but the quality of care was so much better than we could provide doing 24/7 care.",2022-03-31 19:28:19,_constantly_eating_,ttcpfs
Dementia,Dad’s best friend died. Do we tell him?,"Dad is late mid-stage Alzheimer’s. He had been obsessing over buddies to hang out with. He was a social butterfly before diagnosis and he loves his people.

His oldest best friend has now died, my godfather, a man more a brother than a friend.  

His friend told us before he died he didn’t want him to see him in the hospital and not to tell dad until he came home, but he never came home.  His wife left it up to us whether we tell dad that his best friend died. 

I have two images in my head- one of dad hugging and holding his best friends wife and kids in mutual, adult grief. Dad being at the funeral to support and show love. 

The other image is dad spiraling into depression. Then forgetting, getting told again and again with some sort of hellish parody of “50 first dates.” Dad misbehaving and acting out during the funeral. 

What do I do? Two best friends were kept apart at the moment of death. Do I keep them apart forever? This is my worst nightmare.","One of my worst days was when my dad's friend died.  I made the mistake of telling him.  He sobbed himself to sleep, woke up, and asked ""Why am I so sad?""  Like an idiot, I told him we went through the cycle two or three times before I finally figured it out.  Don't tell him.  The fantasy of mutual, adult grief just doesn't exist for anyone with this disease.
Don't tell him. Because the likeliest thing is that he will be devastated, forget by the next day, and then be traumatized again if you tell him. This is the advice I've heard from specialists as well as caregivers - it's called compassionate lying. We never told my mom that her brother died either. 

If he asks why he doesn't visit, the easiest thing is to blame it on the pandemic, but it is much easier to come up with a halfway decent story than it is to traumatize and re-traumatize him with news that he won't be able to retain and will contribute to his depression.
I wouldn’t tell him. It’s compassionate lying. If he asks for him you can say that they just visited yesterday and they had a wonderful time. This will depend on how clear your dad is of course.
As a clinical nurse supervisor who works with dementia/Alzheimer’s residents it’s better not to tell him. Also, if he’s at a facility I wouldn’t tell the staff about it as they may let it slip unintentionally.

Sometimes things like that will stick with them. I had one resident who couldn’t remember what he ate 10 minutes ago, but would randomly remember someone told him his wife passed away and he would lose it.

There’s no consistent course with this disease in terms of how people react to different news. I’ve seen more bad outcomes than good ones. Ultimately it’s your families decision though. Great job reaching out for advice though. Not a lot of people do that.
My mom died 16 years ago. About 2-3 years ago my dad's dementia started getting worse. About a year before he passed, so about 14 years after my mom died, he asked about her and asked if she was traveling or if she was in college. I made the mistake of telling him she died. I still cry when I think of the grief on his face. I never told him that again. I always said something like she's inside the house or she went to sisters house or something and he was fine with it. 

If I were you I wouldn't tell him.
Your dad sounds like such a sweetheart!

You've already received the advice I'd give--don't tell him. There's no upside to it, and while telling him wouldn't be actively unkind (since it would only be with the best of intentions, in the name of honesty), it's kinder not to tell him. While it's true that he's an adult who deserves the respect of being told the truth, in this case the only outcome is that it would just make him suffer.
Has your Dad been asking about his friend since he sent into the hospital?  If he has, then just continue to tell him what you have been telling him.  Most time someone with dementia doesn't really have the ability of knowing what day it is or how much time has past. If at all possible I would not tell him because his level of understanding is low and his short term memory is gone. No reason to put him through trauma he will forget a short time later.
This happened to my FIL and my grandpa. It seemed like it would have been kinder to not tell them. My FIL was mostly with it so we had to tell him because he might have tried to call his friend who passed, but my grandpa was a different story. He was in a different nursing home from my grandma so he asked about her every day. As long as she was ok that’s all he wanted to know. When she died he was on point more than we had ever seen him, knew all the people who came to the funeral home, some we didn’t even know, and greeted everyone and talked to everyone. The next day it was as if none of that ever happened and he forgot my grandma died. Every day he asked about her and had to grieve all over again because his brain forgot about the day before. This went on for a few days with him being inconsolable finding out about my grandma every day so they started telling him she was ok again and then he was ok. Sometimes it’s the kinder thing to do, even if it’s a lie. Nothing will be gained by telling him, it will just make him more upset.
I did not tell my grandmother when her best friend died. She wouldn't have remembered by the next day so it would just devastate her for no reason.
Definitely time for a therapeutic lie. Look at it this way: we deal with grief by processing it. We mourn, we think, we talk to others, we redirect, we come up with ways to cope. A healthy brain can do all that. Your dad's brain can't. That means he'll get stuck in his grief, without healing or reprieve. So the kindest thing to do is to grant him that reprieve ahead of time, by not telling him and forcing him into this kind of endless grief Groundhog Day.
Coming at this from a slightly different angle to other comments but of course it it’s ultimately a family decision:

I would tell him. 

He may wonder why his friend hasn’t been around and this can cause frustration and feelings of abandonment. People with dementia can also still recognise some social cues such as discomfort when people around them are lying which can cause mistrust and potentially confrontation (I recall a story of a woman with dementia in a nursing home in Australia. Her son died and the family chose not to tell her. Other children and even her daughter in law continued to call to see her. She would ask about her son and people would tell her he’s busy etc. One day they found she had ripped up all the photos of him in her room. Even though her memory was impaired, she still knew something was wrong and believed her son had stopped visiting her for another reason. The nursing home eventually convinced the family the best course of action was to tell the truth and while it was difficult it had better outcomes and the woman no longer felt abandoned by her son). 

I suppose the point is people with dementia are still people. Telling your father the truth will be difficult, yes, but just remember this news would be difficult to hear and process even without cognitive impairment. There is a theory that people with dementia can in fact grieve but due to the cognitive difficulties it just happens over a longer period of time and takes more support from those around them. Anecdotes supporting this theory talk about providing prompts to talk about the person and their death such as a picture at the funeral/grave, a memorial card and other reminiscence material relating to the deceased person to help guide conversations in a slightly more positive nostalgic direction.

In my mind truth is the best approach but only if those around your dad are ready and willing to help him grieve for as long as it takes. It is completely understandable to want to protect the ones we love with dementia from potentially upsetting situations and try to keep them in a content state but when we look at our own lives and feelings we recognise we aren’t happy 24/7.. nobody is! And so it’s an unrealistic expectation to set for ourselves to try and keep the person we care for content for the rest of their lives.

So the true best option is the option that you and your family are able to manage. If you and your family don’t feel capable of having multiple conversations about your dad’s friend and supporting and managing the feelings that come with this, it may be best to avoid the truth. Just make sure when your dad asks about that friend your dad still feels that his friend cares about him even though he hasn’t seen him in a while.

Your post shows that your main concern is your dad and his wellbeing so as long as you continue to allow that to guide your decisions, you will never go wrong. You’re doing great ❤️
i am going to offer a different answer then most. 
this is obviously a very different situation but:
my mother has advanced dementia and my father was her caretaker. my father passed away. 
my mom knows dad is dead. she does not forget that he is dead. it does not retraumatize her. she does not know how long he has been dead, but she knows he is dead. 
the brain in dementia reacts in certain ways. 
for my mom - it is negative things, stressful experiences. the brain in dementia does not completely lose its ability to remember all things. they are capable of forming small amounts of new memory. just a thought. all the best.
Yeh, it's tricky.  I'm torn between telling & not telling.  If yr dad is not too far gone - tell him.  If he's much more advanced - don't tell.  If it's in same city/area, and there will be a funeral / memorial service for him, I'd say your dad would be beyond devastated that he hadn't gone to his beloved best mates send-off funeral, and fuming angry, confused, & devastated that family had withheld the information from him, deemed him incapable of processing it.   

Could you do a bit of both?   Tell him, accompany to the funeral / memorial, but in following months / years when/if yr dad enquires about his mate, depending on yr dads state that day, do either not-telling-distractions, or reminding 'no he passed away last March didn't he'.  

 We've had a few bereavements of family & friends over the past few years, although nobody who could be called 'best friend', and all interstate anyway.  My mum, who is later stage of medium, I told her all of them.  From them all, we received their Memorial Booklet / card.  Some of them, we placed that memorial on the sideboard / near mums bedside table, where she could see it daily, eventually it sank in, then we put the memorial away in a drawer.   Others, we told her, showed her when it arrived, then put it in a drawer after a few days.  Off-the-cuff, she doesn't remember that they've passed on, but when reminded, she does.  And sadly but fondly looks over the memorial cards/booklets.  Sometimes when we go to her mothers grave, we take extra flowers 'for the others'.  

So yeh, idk... best of luck!
My dad has advanced dementia and we decided not to tell him my brother died of brain cancer. He was the favorite and everyone knew it. Especially to my dad. The grief associated with him not remembering the next day or a couple of weeks of grief, whatever it may be
I think telling them once is important.  But only once, and after that, distract, deflect, or lie if they ask, make up something nice.",2022-03-31 17:37:14,Twelveangrywomen,ttaflo
Dementia,LBD and hallucinations,"Looking for any feedback regarding the classic symptom of hallucination with Lewy Body Dementia. My mom has been diagnosed with LBD, but to my knowledge, does not hallucinate.","Not everyone has hallucinations, sometimes hallucinations don't start until later in the disease, some hallucinations are nice and they don't know they are hallucinations. My husband was sitting in the car with me looking out the window and was ""watching"" birds in murmuration.  He was really enjoying the show and pointed it out to me and the sky was totally clear.  Also, we don't live in an area where that happens.  Point being if he hadn't mentioned it to me I wouldn't have know he was having a hallucination and he wouldn't have known either.
Keep in mind that she isn't going to be able to tell you she's hallucinating, because from her perspective, everything she's experiencing is *real.* If you're sitting next to me, I'm not going to say ""hey, my cat is here,"" I'm assuming you're seeing the same thing. Same goes for people with hallucinations - there's no way for them to tell it's not real, so they figure you are seeing the same thing. Why comment on it? 

Unless she needs to interact with them, and especially if the hallucinations are harmless or pleasant and therefore not causing distress, it can be very hard to tell when someone's hallucinating.
What led to her diagnosis?
She may not recognize that she is having hallucinations yet. My grandfather started by seeing people and animals in the yard. Then, he talked about seeing movies on the ceiling of his bedroom, which we assumed were dreams. As it progressed it was still happy things, so no big deal. But then there was a change and he would have days were he thought there was someone in the house with a huge knife. It was hard to watch because the delusions are so real it’s so hard to convince them they are not real. I hope for you that your mom’s condition stays mild.

The one thing that helped my grandfather - he was a carpenter and sustained several head injuries when he was a younger man working on buildings. I explained to him several times that because of all those head injuries his brain has some damaged areas that are causing him to see things. When reminded of that he would be accepting of the notion what he was seeing was not real. Alternatively, if you just said “nothing is there” he would argue that it was.",2022-03-31 15:57:07,TexasForever361,tt87nn
Dementia,Should I tell her who I am?,"My grandma needs constant care now. I go a few hours a day and take my toddler. It’s fun, my son just plays and watches tv, and talks nonsense to my grandma and grandpa. 

But… grandma thinks my son is my twin brother. She keeps asking where I am. She thinks I am three years old and missing. I just tell her,  “she’s” okay. 

Should I tell her who I am? What is the correct way to approach this? Thank you.","One thing I learned at an Alzheimer’s seminar is that it only frustrates and confuses the patient if you correct them. You are probably already doing this when you arrive, but if not,  tell her your toddler is your son when you get there.  If she persists that you are his twin and asks where you are, keep doing what you’re doing and tell white lies (she’s at the doctor, with the babysitter, she’ll be right back).
What you’re doing is entering into her reality which is perfectly fine. As previous comments suggested, challenging her thinking may only upset or embarrassed her and potentially damage the communication at that time.

You’re doing great and really glad you and your son get to visit granny! People with dementia tend to love interacting with younger children because children are so great at living in the moment which is where people with dementia can thrive. Best of luck to you x
My Alzheimer's grandmother was in an infirmary and had photos of my late grandfather, her son and daughter, and all of us grandkids. Grandpa had died more than 20 years earlier.

I specifically remember one visit...my father happened to be about 63 at the time, and grandpa died at age 62, both had white beards.

""That's my husband!"" she told me, with glee in her eyes. I noticed a photo of my grandfather shortly before his death. It was quite easy to see how she could believe that. And all I did was share her joy with my own facial expression.

The point is, as dementia and Alzheimer's set in, one's most recent memories start to fade fast. Over time, that person loses trains of thought from one period in their past, and fall back on something less recent. I would posit that in 2004, she had regressed back to 1982.

Still, we went there to take her month-old great granddaughter for her to hold. We will always believe that despite everything, she knew, even briefly, how she was holding a baby of her lineage, that she knew that the was a great grandmother, even if that memory left her mind when we did.
you’re doing it right. You may have success telling her about “where” she is, paint a pleasant picture, some grand plans for a future date and getting her distracted.",2022-03-31 13:13:57,blameitonmyouth,tt4m88
Dementia,Need Advise: parent(s) misplacing things,"One of my parents has been leaving salt and pepper shakers in the microwave a few times and (from what I can tell) not thinking it was them who did it. I only brought it up the first time but am afraid to again. My mom’s family has a strong history of dementia and her own mom (my grandma) now has it. It seems like all women on her side at some point get dementia. So I think it’s my mom who did this but I don’t know. Does anyone have advise on what to do? I need to be sensitive about it all. 

Also my mom recently picked up smoking weed again for pain so I’m wondering if perhaps she’s just high, but given her close family history that seems unlikely.","First step I'd take is to double-check that the shakers are microwave safe -- and if they're not (i.e.: if they're the type with metal lids), go out and get a set that is.
Get it checked early - MRI scans. Note : your parent will be DEFENSIVE . Jusy be as gentle and emphasize it’s because you care abs just want to be careful. But they may get defensive and angry
Try to figure out who did it and get the person checked out. It could be as simple as a delerium, which mimics dementia but can be treatable.",2022-03-31 12:38:06,bubblesburstyn,tt3tro
Dementia,Help Dealing with Prying People?,"My mom was diagnosed with dementia in 2021 when she was 63 and I was 25 (f). To make a long story short, she was in and out of the hospital so many times due to her health issues from alcohol abuse which led to Wernicke’s, which is how she has  developed dementia. My mom is in assisted living now because it truly got to be too much of a burden providing care for her while trying to work. (Not to mention that it was hard for me during the pandemic as a recent grad school graduate to maintain work after the pandemic hit. There was always a contract ending and no true traditional employment offer until the one I have now.) My mom would go out of her way to get alcohol whenever she wanted, which was against her care plan, and that wasn’t acceptable.

My godmother, aka my mom’s best friend, keeps making comments such as “All that facility is doing is housing her. She doesn’t have dementia as bad as her other floor mates, so I don’t see why she needs to be there.”

Yesterday, my godmother texted me asking when could my mother come home. I didn’t reply because I’m in week 2 of my new job and I had to make time to visit my mom in person as well as do everyday house chores. Besides, I get several other messages during my day that need more immediate attention.

When I woke up this morning, I got a text from my godmother accusing me of “lying” to my mom about not talking to her. She repeated her same points about wanting my mom to be out. 

Still, when my mom is home and in and out of the hospital because of her self-destructive behaviors, my godmother will be at peace at home with her husband, two dogs, and fun weekend planned with her grandkids. 

I don’t want to be my mom’s parole officer or maid. (She had a bad habit of making bio waste messes around the house.) I feel like between COVID and caring for my mom, I lost a critical 3 years in my 20s. I want to travel more and not have to think about complex care plans like I have a kid or pet, which I don’t. I’m already POA over her estate as her only child and take care of the home I share with my mom as if I’m the full owner.

So I went from regular college young adult to real-world adult that couldn’t afford to make financial mistakes. That’s why I don’t think anyone—especially my godmother—should be telling me I need to bring my mother home. I want to have a quality of life, too, just like my godmother has maintained by being very hands-off with my mother. My godmother has not visited my mom at home as much as she has in assisted living.

I have an urge to tell my godmother off, but I’m fighting it because it’s not even 10am in my time zone. Any tips or ideas for a response if any?","Tell her that your mom needs 24/7 care as per her doctor’s orders and you are unable to provide that for her, but if your godmother so chooses to take her on, your mom can go live with her. 

It’s always easy for outsiders to have opinions until they have to step into the shoes of being the caregiver.
There are always backseat drivers who don't really have skin in the game trying to influence the lives of others. Usually they mean well but just don't get it, but sometimes they're just meddlers. You know you'rye godmother, if she falls into the first category, sit down with her and explain your experiences with your mother to her so she'll shut up. If it's the second, ignore her and if she causes trouble, ask that she isn't allowed to visit any more.
People on the outside of the caregiver experience never really understand what it's like. When my grandma in law was in a care home with stroke induced dementia, we constantly had people telling us that me and my partner weren't doing enough for her. Despite the fact that my partner was her POA, we visited her 5 times a week, we didn't have jobs for two years so we could handle everything going on, (packing up her old apartment, rehoming her cat, etc.) 

It's exhausting, and mostly thankless, and unfortunately visitors don't see how bad it is. Sorry you're dealing with this. Dementia takes so much, it shouldn't take your life away from you too.
You are not the only one to have your care giving strategy analyzed, questioned, judged, criticized . . . by friends and family members. I wish I had answers. 

If you choose A, you will always have someone feel that not choosing B is the reason why the loved one is not thriving.

IMO, the caregiving strategy you have chosen is by far the best option for her.

Also, a mentally sounded parent does not want their child to sacrifice their life for them.
Ask her if she can house her for a couple of weeks to see first hand how independent and capable she is.  

If she scoffs at that, tell her to mind her own fn' business. I'm lucky that the only person in my life is on the same page as me as far as the care goes, but I would lose my shit in a second to have some ""friend"" of hers telling her I'm taking care of her incorrectly. I'm too old and cranky to tolerate it not even for a second.
Your Godmother is way out of line. And the way she keeps harping on this makes me wonder if she has some sort of cognitive decline.  

While your mother may not seem as bad as the other residents as your Gm points out, I’m sorry to be blunt but she WILL get there.  And consider this (and share with your Godmother): every time someone with dementia moves, they are known to decline a bit further.  

For your own sake do not entertain the idea that your mom can go home at some point. Based on what you’ve described, your mom needs to stay in assisted living/memory care. 

You deserve to have some sense of normalcy.  Even though your mom is in assisted living, be prepared for the occasional problems that you’ll have to address.  But, don’t listen to your Gm.  Live your life as best you can and should.
Feeling really upset on your behalf. I'm over here in my 50s, an age when it's expected to be supporting an elderly parent, and God knows I loved my dad to bits but there were times I felt almost resentful, not towards him, but the dementia.

How you coped and are coping at such a young age is remarkable. 

Agree with other posters. Tell Godmother she can either open up her own home to her oh-so-capable friend /s, or she can shut up.
Even former caregivers can't fully understand the path *you* are walking.  Each experience is individual and comes with different challenges.  I read some of the comments on here and feel blessed that, as bad as my experiences have been, I haven't had to face *that* particular torture.  All you can do is calmly maintain your boundaries.  ""I wasn't able to provide sufficient care for Mom here at home.""
Hi. I'm really sorry you are going through this. Your story sounds eerily similar to what I went thru. My uncle once complained how ""annoying"" it was to talk to my mom. I no longer speak to my uncle if I can avoid it. 


Im wondering if your godmother enables your mom's behavior? If so, you have every right to call her out.

Edit: if your mom is anything like mine, she won't stop drinking and an assisted living facility is the right place for her.
Per /u/JezebelleAcid,

>  if your godmother so chooses to take her on, your mom can go live with her.

Say this, but **mean it**.

You shouldn't be bluffing.  Who knows, it's possible they'll take you up on it.  And if they do, they'll learn what's really involved.  And it's not your problem either way.

Who am I kidding.  It's extremely unlikely your godmother will do it.  But say it like you mean it -- ""so, shall I tell the hospital that she's going to stay with you at the end of the month?""

It is sadly VERY EASY for people to kibbitz, to criticize and offer ""constructive suggestions"" when they don't have to back them up.  After all, in their mind they ""only want what's best"" for your Mom, ""no harm in that"" is there? 

/s

It also can be very difficult for people who haven't been intimately involved for the situation to fully accept the patient's condition.  They see her occasionally, she seems fine.  They see her in the hospital and she always complains to them about wanting to get out (because dementia sufferers generally can't accept their own condition, which is part of the tragedy of the situaiton).  They maybe feel guilty that she's in the hospital, and try to push that guilt on you.

OP, ignore your godmother and keep on keeping on...
I would be tempted to go off as well!

How about a compromise? Send her here and tell her that after she reads at least 100 different stories to get some perspective of what you might be going through, AND responds to those members of this forum in a caring tone, she can consider addressing you in the tone that you deserve. Until then, simply say that you are not going to air your mother's dirty laundry or health issues in defense of your own well thought out decisions that are in her (and everyone associated's) best interests. 

Give her an analogy that just because a cute baby doesn't shit its diaper during the time that she is holding it, does not mean that those parents cannot be exhausted from constant changes and broke from all the diaper changes that literally nobody else sees. Around the effing clock!

And ""our babies"" are full grown adults full of piss and vinegar who won't even let us change them, let alone get them bathed after a blowout sometimes! Then let's not EVEN talk about excrement art!

Nah. It bring out the ""street"" in me. Fuck. THAT!

The depth of people's ignorance is ASTOUNDING!
The great thing about modern tech is the ability to block texts, set rules to send email to spam, and generally ignore certain people. Don't engage with the drama; it's a waste of your energy.  At minimum, send her communications to a separate folder and read them at a time of your choosing.   It sounds like you were once close, but this is not a healthy, supportive relationship now.  This seems to be a common problem for caregivers, and I'm sorry that you seem so alone in this now.  Have confidence that you are making sound decisions about what is best for your mother and yourself.
If you were to fetch your mum home and be with her 24/7, I'm sure your godmother would find something to criticize. It's easy to find fault when you're not the one dealing with the situation. She should be asking you what she can do to help and support - not tearing you down.
I'm on this subreddit as a nurse in a long term care home on the dementia unit and I swear the same thing happened to me where another family member that is not the poa was telling me the resident didn't have that bad of dementia, but seeing her daily I know that's not true. No one should ever have to go through the stress of 24/7 care alone and many people in these units have varying degrees. It looks different for every person
That's the worst part of dementia is when other people have their little opinions and think they know best. I live with my mom who has it but I get such annoying non stop ""suggestions"" from my aunt. Plus every time my aunt calls she gets my mom started on one of her dementia loops and she usually upsets her with non stop barking random orders/advice. I hate living with my mom but if I have less people putting their nose in our business we'd be better off!
Wow, that must be horrible honestly. I think your extremely brave and strong for dealing with all that. The finances, care, etc. especially being a only child and so young. It's horrifically horrible the destruction dementia and alcohol causes. We also had other members of my dad's side of the family judging him for putting his mum in a home with alzheimers and saying we don't see her enough or not interested in caring for her. When in reality my dad has been POA past 2 years spending hundreds of hours sorting out my grandparents estate and getting them the best deals and things possible for their care. I think your god mother should stay out of it, trust your gut on what to do in your mums case. Maybe the assisted living is probably the best, safest, place for your mum. And you should be allowed to enjoy your 20s and have mum looked after too and not have to worry in that aspect of things.
I have nothing constructive to say here.  Tell these people they can file a petition with the court to get guardianship if they don’t like the decisions you’ve made.  F them and their little minds. 

I’m sending you love and light and wishing karma on the haters
Offer to have your mother delivered to her home and express what a relief it is to know she'll take care of her since you're busy trying to keep your life on track.

It helps to not give a damn if people like you or not.
The stress from backseat drivers is almost as bad as the illness. You’re doing great, really. It was hard enough for me at 25 caring for my 90 y/o grandmother, actually I was just helping my 60s mom manage it, not even taking the reigns myself. And at 90, she didn’t have as much energy to create trouble as a younger patient in her 60s would. 

“if you feel that you can do it better than me, please have at it.”
It sounds like your mom is in the best place for her well being. Not sure if I would encourage your gm to take in your mom simply because it could end badly for your mom. An alcoholic with dementia needs specialized care that your gm doesn’t seem to appreciate.

All the best. You sound like an incredible young woman. Your mom is lucky to have you watching out for her.

My family member is a neurologist who specializes in sleep disorders and has dementia patients, melatonin is far and away what she recommends.
Just know that a sleep aid might not be the solution. My Mom was waking up several times a night and try to get out of bed, this would wake my Dad and he’d need to get up.  He would take her to the bathroom and she would usually pee at least once in the night. This was very frustrating as my Dad wasn’t getting any sleep and because my Mom is in diapers all the time and never seemed bothered by peeing in a diaper during the day - he was getting exhausted by her need to pee overnight. We stopped all fluids 4-5 hours before bed - didn’t work.  We had sleeping pills prescribed to keep her sleeping - didn’t keep her in bed. We had anti-anxiety meds prescribed for bedtime - she still got up 3 times a night.  Finally we got her a prescription for overactive bladder (Solifenacin) that she takes only at night.  She finally slept through the night (7-8 hrs).  She still pees lots during the night, but we use a nighttime diaper and put a pad inside the diaper.  The meds stop the bladder spasms - which is what was making her wake up.  This has been a game changer and we wish the doctor had prescribed it sooner.",2022-03-31 09:07:26,HaroldBAZ,tszd1d
Dementia,My Uncle May Have Possible Dementia,"Hello everyone! I am a 24 year old living in a bit of a complicated situation. For some background context; my homeless uncle was moved in with us for his health and safety. He is 60 years old and has had speech issues for a while (stuttering and making nonsense or talking about random things totally off subject). We could tell his memory was not where it should be but we thought it was normal for his character. He refuses to go to the doctor or address a few issues but I believe it is dementia but I am unsure of what stage it could possibly be. 

Recently my family and I have been having issues with my uncle. Almost every time he goes to the bathroom there is feces smeared on the toilet seat and I am the one that usually has to clean it up. I’ve spoke to my mom about it and she basically has took the turn a blind eye pretend it’s not happening route which I can understand her logic behind but the issue is still occurring. I went to the bathroom tonight and there was feces smeared all over the toilet seat and toilet. This time it was considerably a much more in depth issue to handle. A few days ago I had to bleach and scrub our shower because of a fecal issue all over the bottom of the shower, I just cleaned it up sort of did what I had to do and brought it to my moms attention. 

He does not shower, we have reminded him many times to shower but he refuses and goes without a shower for a month or two and we honest to god try so hard to get him to shower but I don’t know how to force him to shower. He can shower on his own but just chooses not to. He is very similar in changing clothes as well, will only change his clothes once a month despite us pleading with him and trying to find compromise. 

I am trying to understand how feces is getting smeared all over the toilet and the only explanation that makes sense to me is he soils his clothes and sits in it and it just transfers to the toilet. I’m not sure what else would be an explanation for it. 

I have no knowledge on how to care for someone with dementia, this is all new to me. My mom is more of an authority figure for our household and she works a lot so she’s not at home or handling these issues as much as I am. I understand that as we get older we have accidents, we lose our memory, etc. I am not blaming him by all means and I am not out to embarrass him or shame him in any way. I’ve read about different stages of dementia and to me it sounds like he could be in the late stages. Again, I am new to this so I would not exactly know. I have tried so hard to get him to go to a doctor, pleaded and begged for him to shower and change clothes. I have tried making compromise like using wet wipes or a damp wash cloth. We have unfortunately had arguments and small fights about showering, changing clothes, bathroom hygiene, and going to a doctor. I am sort of the one that is handling these situations primarily and I feel like I am truly lost. We are a low income family so it’s extremely difficult to be able to put him in a care home or have in-home help or aid to come. 

I would be extremely grateful for any tips, advice. My mom could do a little bit more to assist in help and support in my opinion and we are working on that. I am concerned for my uncle but I can’t force him to go to a doctor or change clothes, no matter how hard I try I just can’t seem to get him to understand.","He needs a doctor to prescribe him medication to make him more amenable. He is at risk of slipping on his body fluids in the bathroom as well as UTI. Also he may take the suggestion of bathing easier from strangers much easier instead of his family, strangely. 

if you share your country/state people can suggest social resources. For the state programs that are available in the US he alone needs to be low income.",2022-03-31 07:21:03,exhaustedcaution,tsxjfb
Dementia,Bedridden grandmother with Dementia and alzheimers.,"When I come to visit which isn't often as we live in different cities but she seems so bored and lost, I can understand with her just being stuck in bed and can't really do anything, she has a TV but I was just wondering if there's anything for her to do, when people visit they ask how she is but mostly talk amongst themselves as she can't really hear properly and obviously doesn't remember much so no one really knows what to say.
I feel awful, I really hope someone here could give me some ideas to make her more involved and less bored. 
She will even roll over pouting with her back is to us cause no one is talking to her.
First time we're dealing with Dementia in this family so any help and advice would be appreciated.","Do you have any pictures you can show her of family or trips she might remember? That might help her feel engaged and interested. Even if it’s just you or a family member retelling a story about the photo.
Maybe you could put on some music that she likes? And maybe bring some colouring books if she likes that sort of thing? You two could colour together while you listen to music from her generation/her favourite songs! Just an idea, I hope you find something that works for the both of you!! :)
If she doesn’t have hearing aids look into something called a Pocket Talker, no prescription, it basically has a microphone you pass around to whoever is talking and it ports the sound into her headphones. 

music is always great especially from the era when she was a teenager. Go on spotify etc there are lots of playlists. You may be amazed at the memories from decades ago that familiar music unlocks. 

I had started doing some genealogy research and as such gave her prompts about her grandparents, she shared her memories of visiting their farm and such. if she doesn’t remember don’t press it just move on to a new topic. My grandmother felt awkward feeling “expected” to remember something and being unable to. 

I brought some Benjamin Moore paint color catalogs and home decorating magazines and we “window shopped” ideas for remodeling the house. Same with travel, magazine spreads featuring cute hotels abroad. It doesn’t matter if the grand plans never happen, it’s fun for her to dream especially if she gets the chance to share memories (like somewhere she did travel you didn’t know about) but not be required to",2022-03-31 07:19:08,originalworgor2352,tsxicm
Dementia,Heavy question. Has anyone experienced palliative sedation with their LO??,"Mom is doing so poorly at her care facility. They are running out of options to help her constant state of anxiety and extreme behaviors she is having. Palliative sedation was discussed today. I can’t even put into words the mind fu@k this is to try and process. Essentially to keep her calm they have to use extremely heavy medications which basically just keep her “snowed” all day so she has zero quality of life. Everything about this disease SUCKS! I just want her suffering to be over. My poor poor momma. It just won’t let go of it’s evil grip on her. This is utterly just soul crushing. 

Thank you as always for being the best group of people on Reddit.","I'll be blunt.

You can leave him unmedicated. He will be miserable. The residents will be upset. The staff will be frustrated. You will be miserable. He may even act out so badly that they can no longer care for him at that facility. Then what? A behavioral health center? And then what? Dementia doesn't get better. It gets worse. Do they still have mental hospitals, because that is where I feared my loved one was going to end up. She would be miserable there, too.

Or, you can allow medication. He will settle down. The residents will not be disturbed. The staff will be able to properly care for him. Without the stress or anxiety that might be the trigger for his behavior, he may even become blissfully unaware of his situation and have some peaceful good moments with you. You will still be sad at what is happening, but let me tell you, it's 100% better to have them ""comfortably numb"" than have them shouting at everyone, breaking things, and you wondering what the next phone call is going to bring to an already crappy situation.

I'm so sorry you are going through this. It sucks for everyone and is such a soul crushing disease.
Yes my dad has that. He gets diazepam up to 4 times a day, as needed. I was really clear that I didn't want it just to make it easier for the care home staff, if had to be in his best interests and it does seem to be helping. Before he was extremely distressed, hitting himself and shouting out. He wasn't able to leave his room as he was so vocal it was scaring the other residents. Now he is much calmer. He's not actually unconscious all day, he's just more relaxed.

It's devastating isn't it?
Our dad would “sundown” something awful st night, so his doctor prescribed 0.5mg of Ativan at night so he could sleep and us too. There was an option to give him an extra if needed until he stopped eating and just slept all the time. Toward the end he did have a couple of rough nights and  the hospice nurse told us there was liquid Ativan in the hospice kit and morphine. She told us how much to give him and to call them and they would walk me thru it. I’m retired health care support so I knew the morphine would suppress his breathing quietly and quickly, fortunately we never had to make that decision. He passed a couple of days later, quietly with all of us there. Respectfully, it was a blessing and we were grateful his struggle and our struggle was done. We took care of him at home 24/7 for 2 1/2 years rotated every 4-5 days, 4 1/2 kids(there’s always one)
When I had a patient who was constantly restless and in anxiety without it being terminal restlessness we work to get a physical therapist involved to see if it was safe to have the staff walk the patient to burn off the excess energy. So that might be an option.
I am so sorry this is happening to your Mom. I can imagine the stress you are undergoing.  Right now your Mom has no quality of life, she is suffering greatly. My understanding is there are levels of palliative sedation, she can be kept totally zonked or taken to a level where she is somewhat aware of her surroundings, not able to really participate in what is happening though. I don't know what I would do if this was my husband, I think I would do anything to ease his suffering. Whatever decision you make you are making out of love and it will be the right decision.
They gave meds to my dad until eventually they affected his kidneys … and he passed away … for my father it was a 3yr decline after mom died … it was a relief and he was able to die peacefully
Oh my, how old is she? I'm afraid that there would also come a time that this will happen to my mom. Is that something all dementia patients go through? Like a phase?
One thing to keep in mind is the drugs they use, benzodiazepines like Ativan, Xanax, are commonly used recreationally because they make you feel good. Being on them is pleasurable so she will not only be calmer but may actually enjoy it.
Hmm, palliative sedation is usually done inpatient in a hospice or hospital when a person is dying. Is your mom at the end of her life?",2022-03-30 22:46:32,realblondee,tspyow
Dementia,"I know being a caregiver is difficult, but what are some fun times/funny dementia moments you’ve had with your loved one?","Funny moment with my dad:  Today, I was driving and talking to my mom (who was seated at the back) when, out of nowhere, a chicken bone comes flying across my face and hits the windshield. My dad now tends to throw food when he’s done eating, because he panics if he doesn’t immediately find a trash can afterwards. Really frustrating sometimes, but today it was just really funny.","Every time my grandma has potato salad she gets really happy and says “wow, I haven’t had potato salad in years!” so I buy it for her every two weeks or so. She gets a kick out of it every time.
My dad would occasionally do very silly, strange things, like wrap his oxygen tube into a spiral and then try to wear it like a hat. He concentrated so hard to roll it up, and then was bemused when it wouldnt stay. I almost thought he was just messing with me. He was always a big weirdo. It made me laugh, and that laughter helped me get through.
When my dad's memory was failing him or if he was sick he would always say he wished he died soon. I would reply with: don't worry about it Dad, I guarantee it will happen one day. He would chuckle and move one. The joke never got old because he'd forget that I said the same thing the last time he had brought it up. 

He thought my brother-in-law was his senior in college. My dad was a good 30 years older than him.

He and his care taker used to flirt (innocently) with each other, it was cute. He was 50 years older than her.
We would take daddy on short rides when the weather was nice. I took him on a trip to the gas station to fill up and go thru the car wash. I pull in, the water starts and I realize my window was down😂 He’s yelling roll the damn window up! Then the next breath is “I gotta pee”. Dad, uh we’re in the car wash, ahh just go in your underwear(adult diaper). He starts cracking up and said “I already did”😆
My grandma randomly opens up whatever napkin or handkerchief she has been incessantly folding, hangs it on her face, and says, “Peekaboo!” chuckling at her own silliness. She also loves to smooth out my shirt when I sit leaning over her and occasionally honks my boob, apparently thinking it’s a small billow of fabric.
I've been trying to come up with a funny story. The only thing I can think of right now is how he will blurt out ""Who are you and why are you in my house/car?!"" at the strangest moments. I make him breakfast every morning. He finished eating breakfast and looked at me unloading the dishwasher and said ""Who are you and why are you in my house?!"" I wanted to say something silly like I'm the burglar that breaks in to make you breakfast and unload the dishwasher every morning. You know, like we burglars like to do. 😋
My grandpa is currently suffering from Alzheimer’s and he will say the most random things. A recent funny thing that happened was I was giving him his snack of a salad roll and he responds ‘’you are the best shopper in Mississippi!’’

For context, we live in the UK and my grandpa has never travelled anywhere near Mississippi so I have no idea where it came from!
Every time she farts my mom asks ""who the hell is setting off firecrackers??"" 

(If you try to tell her that was her, that she farted, she looks at you like you're insane and says ""I've never heard *that* before."")

OP, I also recommend joining us on Fridays for the ""funny stories"" weekly post. It definitely helps to remind us all that it isn't all doom and gloom and a lot of people share funny stories.
My dad once ate a lemon like an orange, puckering his lips the whole time, rather than admit that he didn't remember what it was. He was always stubborn, lol.
I unwrapped and gave my grandma a mini snickers after we changed her diaper. Then she flung it until my face lol. i couldn’t help but laugh
My mum has a lot of stuff. One of her collections is baskets, all shapes and sizes. One day my brother made a comment that the lounge was starting to look like a basket museum.

I replied 'basket-case museum'!

Now we joke about when, after mum moves on, we will start our world famous 'basket museum'. Whenever I clean up I make sure to keep all the baskets and I think its rubbed off on mum who reminds me that the baskets are expensive collectables.

I imagine the museum is a large room of white walls and hundreds of baskets on a pedestals. Next to each basket is a little sign that reads, 'Basket. Artist Unknown. Date Unknown'.",2022-03-30 21:27:55,Musuni80,tsoi86
Dementia,Hospital Discharge Planning. What should I ask (UK)?,"My father 63 with Parkinsons and Dementia he has been in an Older Afukt Assessment Ward for 5.5weeks as a result of am acute new presentation. Dementia being the new presentation/diagnosed.

He is still fairy mobile and walks without an aid (OT) has reviewed this and confirmed stick/walker not needed yet, but has had 3/4 falls since being in hospital.

He is complying with medication changes, responds well to prompts and is taking part in some of the group activities (normally quite anti social) although he does take himself off to bed frequently.

We have a multi disciplinary meeting tomorrow and I belive this is to discuss next steps and options for discharge.

What sort of things should I be asking? 

I want my dad out of hospital but I also want him to be safe and have the care and support he needs.  I'm 33 and with full time. I provide a much support as possible but I am not able to  prove 24hr care.","I’m not sure exactly what you should be asking, as I don’t know your specific circumstances. However, if you don’t have a power of attorney - please get that sorted. Also a dnr if that is what your dad wants.

Additionally, what is his living situation at the moment (prior to the fall?) would it be feasible to pay for carers in his own house? 

I think ultimately you need to be thinking of longer term planning yourself. Get all the affairs in order while your dad is able to sign/ help with them because there will come a time when he won’t be able to express his wishes. Also, think about what you can realistically take on. Caring for someone with dementia is brutal for your physical and mental health. 

Unrelated, but I wish I had done more of, is record his voice, take the videos - the voice is the first thing we can’t remember anymore.

I wish you all the luck and love in this situation. It’s crappy but there is a plethora of resources on line. Just make sure you advocate for your well being as well as that of your fathers.
Hello, I'm also UK. Your dad sounds vulnerable, and before being discharged, should have a care plan in place. 

Is your dad able to contribute his thoughts as to what areas he requires support with? What areas concern you? Do you feel your dad needs help with x, y, z? Make certain your concerns are voiced and addressed. Try to make certain that you're aware of all the options that are on the table. If those options seem unviable, ask again if there are any other options. 
Are there therapies you feel your dad would benefit from? 

Your dad should have a social worker assigned to him, and also an Alzheimer's nurse. These are key to organising support (in my experience). Since your dad responded well to social activities ask about access to day centres (even if only for half a day every week). 

The fact that your dad has had falls in hospital must be worrying. If your dad is looking to return home, a home visit should be undertaken to identify risks and steps taken to ensure your dad is as safe as possible in his own home, before he is discharged. 

What happens if your dad does fall over at home? Is he willing and able to wear and operate an emergency alert tag? I would definitely want to know more about the falls in hospital. What caused them? Dizziness? A lack of balance? Had he just eaten, was he dehydrated? Where there 3 or 4? Did the falls happen at a particular time of day, ie, is he more prone to falling on waking or towards evening? 

Do you feel your dad's needs have been thoroughly assessed and addressed? Is assisted living/sheltered accommodation more suited for your dad? An apartment or retirement village can provide extra security, with onsite staff where some residents just require a phone call to make sure a particularly vulnerable resident is okay. 

Since your dad has been in assessment for quite a while, hopefully the team will already have suggestions/plan already in place, and tomorrow's meeting will reassure you and your dad that everyone is on board to making certain that your dad's needs are being met. 

Take notes, and also ascertain who is responsible for what, ie, should you contact A to make sure B happens, or will someone contact you? If so, when should this happen by, what's the timescale. 

Hope some of this helps, sorry it's a bit rambling, and hope the meeting goes well.",2022-03-30 16:25:51,Technical-Part-4425,tsicjq
Dementia,Starting the dementia path…,"My mother had been diagnosed with Mild Cognitive  Impairment.

She lives a lone, can drive, able to go shopping and live a fairly normal life.

She has memory problems and can be repetitive, which can be annoying. Buy she presents well when meeting people, so you wouldn’t nessersarily know there was a problem.

So life is ok, until something goes wrong - As an example she had a dog which last year died of old age and had been going on about getting a new one.  Last Thursday she got a young dog from a rescue home, then on Monday it seems it got out, and rather than go look for the thing, forgot she had it and went to her Monday morning fitness session.

(So able to go through the process of getting a dog, but unable to remember she had one!)

The dog was found and my sister told her to go and get a dog tag cut, so she went down the local town to get a dog tag made and somehow lost her car…..it took us a week to find it, but it seems she parked it close to where she wanted to go, forget she had done that and for some reason walked half a mile to the local supermarket and then got a taxi home.

However, she couldn’t explain where her car was and came up with all sorts of reasons - it was being taken for a service, my sister had hidden it to stop her driving, she had been scammed and tricked into giving someone the keys etc etc.  And she was not pleasant - not about the car, but that she was trapped in her house and couldn’t go anywhere and would likely starve….she’s a 10 minute bus (which is free for pensioners) ride from town, but refused to consider that.

She is also bored, and the problem here is that if I or my sister take her out, she won’t remember and then after dropping her off home, she will then phone up complaint she hasn’t seen anyone.

So what I need really is a pointer as to where to start with dealing with someone who is getting dementia - tips and tricks that make life easier and less stressful.   For instance someone mentioned don’t tell them you’re taking them out at the weekend as they will be constantly calling asking when you were picking them up; instead call them on the day.

Many thanks
Matthew","So you might not like to hear this, but it may be a good idea to rehome the dog, unless there is someone going over there multiple times a day to ensure it's being cared for. 

Secondly, sounds like another trip to your mom's doctor is in order. Could be her mild impairment has evolved significantly. It's hard to do anything ""official"" without a proper diagnosis. I'd also start by getting durable medical and financial POA for your mom while she's lucid, along with updating her will and medical directives. That makes things much, much simpler down the line.
The main thing I wish I had done was to embrace that it is a start of a journey that will only get worse in order to think through the plan of what we want to do. I also wish I had understood the tradeoffs between what they deserve and what I can manage. If you want them to stay in their home then plan for it at the beginning as there is no going back once they've moved. How much time, energy and self can you dedicate to their care? Even having my parents in a good facility 3 minutes from my home entails multiple calls at all times for different things. Recognize that they live in the moment and anything before or after doesn't matter. Take a class in how how to manage people with dementia. It is tempting to try and correct them, but they seem to enjoy being agreed with more (verbally, not always in action).
Looking back and forth, these are some of my experiences from the top of the head, but we began with diagnosed mild dementia and are now in the later stages. So it was worse where you're at in the beginning and much worse now.

First things first: Mild cognitive impairment can but must not lead to dementia, so I hope your mother stays just a little bit confused and accepts that she must give up driving one day, for her and other people's safety.

Just an anecdote from my mother with the mentioned later stages of dementia. There is only one thing she takes badly if this issue comes up and this is taking her car away. Same goes for my aunt, where her children took the keys and while I see no way around it, as they are a safety hazard, I realize what a significant impact this has and had on their Lifes.

- Like you said, if she's getting visits, plan these days ahead with the visitors and yourself and don't tell her about it. My mother was worrying every day of the week that the visitor would come any hour and she had to prepare the tables, while the planned visit was four days away.

- Planning for visitors is imho essential. Spontaneous visits by friends, which will become increasingly less frequent, will collide with your plans, i.e. when your sister is going to pick your mom up.

- Get her hearing aid and glasses up to date. It will be difficult to get satisfactory results in testing later otherwise.

- Replace overly complicated hardware with simple stuff, if possible (phone, TV remote), so she gets used to it, which may prolong the usage of this equipment in the future.

- Discuss with her the possibility of a nursing home, in the far away future. The possibility of her living there.
No one wants to live in a nursing home, but people also care for the wellbeing of their children and are willing to accept this, if the time comes when their children are unable to cope with the situation anymore.
It eases your mind if you know she'd be ok with it when the day comes.
My sister always says to her children, she wouldn't put them through this ordeal and they she'd be ok going to a nursing home.

- Make sure she's using the tools offered to make her life easier. That she's using i.e. her hearing aids or uses her walker or crane. The latter is especially important (proper hearing aids are also important). Old people like to fall. Do everything in your power so that she's not falling and breaking something. One thing worse than dementia is dementia plus immobility (unless she's 100% in bed, which is worse by itself)

- Other than that, the usual advice. Take every help possible and offered. Inform yourself about possibilities to put the burden on as many shoulders as possible. Try to preserve as much time and freedom for yourself, your family and friends as possible. Everyone will suffer. Realize, when you're unable to bear the burden anymore and decide your next steps. Personally, I've crossed this threshold and still haven't decided. There are no simple answers.

- One thing that comes to my mind and what I often must remind myself of. She's not a baby or child. She is an adult, a complex being, with a full set of experiences, wishes, and emotions, if only for the very moment you interact with her. She can be mean, she can hurt you, if one gets into an argument. Chances of teaching her new things are slim.

- Power of Attorney stuff has been mentioned. 

- Last but not least, the disease fooled me into thinking if I take double care of her, she will get better or we can at least stop it or bring it to a crawl. She didn't. There are always ups and downs. The ups are quite frequent in the beginning and gave me hope, with a few major down phases. But there was never a recovery above the former level and so it was always a race to the bottom. Slowly and steadily.

- Finally, cherish the good times, the clear moments, fun and laughter even if all of this will get rare. And if you get angry or desperate, that's ok. Think about it, try not to tell her and talk with someone about it. Think positively, I'm still learning to do this. There is not much we can do about all the negative stuff, so why bother (ok, this last bit is oversimplified)

All the best
Our dad died from dementia in June. There are 5 of us and we decided to take care of him 24/7, rotating in and out, which we did for 2 1/2 years. Our care was based on his needs. My sister went to a listen/learn about dementia and gave us a lot of information. I worked in support healthcare, so I was able to communicate with his primary care doctor. In 2007, he had signed POA and POHC with me as primary. Our biggest concern was ""when"" it was going to be time for us to start rotating. He locked the screen door on his way out of the house in the middle of the winter we had a lot of snow and polar vortex readings. A neighbor saw him, used a crowbar to pop the door and called me(my number was on the fridge). We moved in that night. Before we moved in, we used to let him take $$ from the bank and take him to play the lottery. We found out some drug addicts would call then come by the house to borrow $$. He got a small pension from a part time job. Since we no longer let him have cash, they came by on a day he got that check, $33.60, took him to the bank, took $30 and left him the rest. The scary part was I only found out because he had a bank printout on the table, which means they knew how much $$ he had. I closed the account and moved him to my bank, changed the mailing address to my brother's house. It was trial and error but helping him have a routine for eating, snacks, dinner and bedtime all helped. He had low dose ativan because he ""sundowned"" pretty bad at night and his doctor said we all needed to sleep. He went on hospice in April and died in June. Eventually, he just stopped eating and drinking and slept all the time. It's a labor of love and I mean labor. It's hard, very hard, but we focused on him and would do it all over again

s/n my dad had a dog we hated but my dad took care of him, until he couldn't. He died 5 days after my dad did.
My dad is at approximately the same stage. He had a diagnosis of MCI 6 months ago, but at his recent neurology exam he received a diagnosis of Alzhemier's dementia. It was a huge relief (for the family) because he has now been reported to the DMV (who will require him to take a driving exam). Also, dad didn't really want to admit he had an issue aside form STM problems. Now he must confront it.

By the time someone has safety concerns (getting lost, losing pets, losing the car), it is *critical* to plan for the future. 

Make sure someone has power of attorney, all accounts are being paid, passwords are available to PoA, estate is planned, etc. Have regular evaluations by a geriatric-specializing neurologist. Talk to the doctor about medication (Aricept comes to mind).

Just don't wait for a precipitous emergency before you take action. By then it can be extremely difficult to makes changes.
It sounds like while she's ""capable"" of operating a car, she's not safe driving. If she can lose her car she can forget where she is, forget hitting a car or person, etc.  It's probably time to take her keys before something tragic happens.
As a person currently dealing with a loved one with an Alzheimer's diagnosis who had many incidents before actually being diagnosed...

1) they're going to be upset about it but I'd recommend finding a way to gently remove the option of driving from them. My loved one had cognitive issues and one day went out driving and ended up 40 miles away from home after dark and ended up crashing their car into someone's shed. Thank God no one was hurt and my loved one walked away with some swelling and bruising but that could have turned out a lot worse. Better to get ahead of it now for their safety. If possible, is there a grocery delivery service that is available in your area to help get her the essentials she needs? 

2) The dog, as much as it may bring them joy, unless someone can regularly check up on it and make sure it's properly taken care of, it's better to get it to another individual that can care for it. We have a dog and it's a source of joy for my loved one to have it around but we have to be vigilant as they're forgetful and sometimes not making sound judgment that the dog needs to stay safe. Maybe a more manageable pet like a fish or bird might be easier to maintain?


Would your mother possibly be open to adult day care or day activites at a community center? They may help with some of the boredom.

My loved one presents with mostly the same symptoms as your mother does and being newly diagnosed, we're learning to navigate the waters better and these are some things we've had to put into place ( some with more success than others).
She is a danger to herself. This is more then ""mild cognitive impairment"" She is going to get lost.
Unfortunately if she is getting lost places and is forgetting her car when she goes out... she's not as able to live alone as you think she is.  I would start looking NOW for a home or making plans to move someone in with her.
What caused her MCI? Like was it just natural deterioration or something else? Sorry if such a question seems abrupt or rude I'm just generally interested. Also sorry you are going through this, I'm going through something similar myself and my grandparents on dad's side both have alzheimers and my nana on mum's side passed of it.
The big dangers at this stage are: 

1. Kitchen fires due to forgetting the stove is on, etc. 
2. Medication errors, again due to memory. 
3. Problems paying bills. 

Monitor all of these to avoid a disaster. Ideally, monitor without her knowing about it. My parent had a disaster in all 3 areas. Also, in another reply someone recommended talking to your Mom about a nursing home in the future. Don't do this. You're just inviting trouble.

My mother died of this.  IMO, if she has lost her car and forgotten she has a dog, she should not be living on her own anymore.  

Some people believe it's better to keep victims home as long as possible. I'm not one. If she were my mother, I'd be looking for assisted living.
It might be worth checking in at her house once a day, or better going out with her to get her grocery’s and everything else she does. Depending on how quick the dementia progresses it could be worth moving in with her at some stage. 

My dad was like this only a couple months ago and he’s only 52, he would seem fine around others and he would drive to get food but then go to do it again because he forgot. It was only minor things but now he doesn’t drive he can’t feed himself he needs someone to show him where he sleeps and just needs 24/7 care. I pray your mother doesn’t deteriorate as quick. 

Some things that work for me are to be understanding with them and to go along with what they say (it’s a lot easier than trying to explain things) Instead of taking her for a drive somewhere you could try going for a walk with her? 

All the best 🙏🏼",2022-03-30 13:35:30,Mgjackson1967,tsbsvm
Dementia,How has your life been affected by taking on care giver responsibilities?,"I have had to put my career on hold, I've gained weight and stopped working out, I've basically just become a shell of myself in some ways. It's hard to find a balance. Every time I think ok now I can finally get my life back on track something else happens to derail it.","Well, life is pretty much over isn't it?  Everything circles around what he can and can't do and it is mostly can't do.  We used to travel, we used to talk to each other, we used to do home remodel and repairs together, he used to cook, we used to take walks together, he used to be interesting, we used to have sex, we used to, we used to, we used to, now we don't do anything.  We are home the majority of the time, he can't deal with crowds, gets lost in stores, has no stamina so can't go for walks, even slow walks are out. The list is endless, my life is at a total standstill, no more volunteer work, no more long walks alone, no more taking care of me, gotten fat and hate it but can't go and work out and really I am losing all initiative to better myself.  He is getting worse, slowly but noticeably, so I have even less of a future ahead of me.  Don't know how I will last through all of this.  Married 48 years and this is how I get to spend my last days, watching him fade away.  He will be oblivious to it all while I will be watching and caring for him.  Is there a reset button somewhere because I would really like to opt out of this scenario.
Our dad died from dementia in June on hospice care at home. There are 5 siblings and four of us took care of him 2 1/2 years in his home rotating in and out every 4-5 days. It was hard. We butted heads sometime but sucked it up and made it work. He slept on the sofa and whomever slept on the loveseat or in a recliner. We all gained COVID weight and slept with one eye open, watching and listening for him, even when he moved to the hospital bed. My hat is off to you for tackling this by yourself. Two of my siblings were retired, I retired late in 2020 and one brother worked but would use vacation days thru the week so he wouldn’t have all weekends. One sister was trifling and had 15 overnights out of 365 days and called my sister if she didn’t want to change daddy’s diaper🙄
We would do it all again in a heartbeat.
Remember to take care of yourself. Do you have someone that could relieve you for a few hours a week maybe twice a day?
I'm with you!! I haven't been able to graduate because I can only take one class per quarter (if I can find any online classes) and I honestly haven't left the house in god knows when. I take care of my dad while my mom goes out to work, but sometimes I wish I could just graduate and help make money too. It's really hard, and I miss having a social life because it's been years, but I'm trying to just focus on the little happy things! One step at a time 😊
I am worried about this, I'm 33 work full time and I'm single no children. I would like to meet someone and build my own family but my dad has parkinsons and dementia and I want to also care and support him as much as possible.  My mum passed when I was 19 so it's only me and my sister to care for him currently while I'm hospital I visit 6 days, clean his clothes, been cleaning and clearing his house for him should he get out and my sister visits once per week. 

I think maybe I won't get the opportunity to settle down myself now.  But I take the small happy moments I get stuff my dad and his I will be grateful for them in later stages.

I hope you find some time for you, even to go a walk, pamper, read a book anything you like. I wish you well
I was supposed to graduate college, and go to the navy afterwards. Sadly I had put it on hold, leave my life in America, and move back to my country. 

It feels like my life is directionless. I don't even know what to do after my father pass away. Maybe I can use the knowledge I've gained from caring my father, to get a caregiving job in America.
It is really difficult but we have to find a way to take care of ourselves too.  Not that I have the answers...  I am not the primary care giver, but I take care of my mom for a couple of weeks at a time every now and then to help out.  We live some distance apart so I cannot help on a daily basis.  But it is really tough because I have a full time job and a family with 3 kids and of course all the responsibilities in the house.  During these times I do not get any exercise, I do not eat as healthy as I normally do.  All my attention goes to my mom and I neglect my family and my job.  I will definitely not be able to do this on a full time basis.

I hope you can find help to give you space to take care of yourself.  The problem is that this can go on for many years..
yea, my career was put on hold a year and half ago, coming up on two years this summer.  i find it so hard to want to hang out with pals when i do get a few days off, i just want to curl up on my couch and veg out to some tv or just sit in complete silence knowing i can make dinner if i want or if i want i can skip it and do it later.  

i've come to terms with there being no real balance but really do miss my single, geek life. i also knew what i was getting myself into so for me its par for the course but i still do miss my prev life of good money, great group of co-workers/pals, social life, dating life (as sad as it was prior, it was something at least) and freedom to just do whatever i wanted.

hang in OP, you are not alone. sending some virtual hugs and love.
Same boat
I’m currently 32 weeks pregnant and began being my mother’s (70F-mild alz) primary caregiver about 6 months ago just after I found out I was pregnant. This is also when my dad suddenly passed. Caregiver burnout is so real and it makes me so angry at myself that I can’t control it. Asking for help has really been the thing that has changed my life so much. Even if it’s just for an afternoon. Picking your battles has been something I struggle with and not correcting her if she tells a story incorrectly. I’m learning a lot more about myself than I thought I would. Keeping her safe and in her own home has been our priority for now but learning to work with her diagnosis and allowing her to do things she CAN do well, not put it in a box because of here limitations, has been tough to learn how to do. We see them as what they can’t do, not what they can still do or can do with help.
Yeah I feel you. I'm still newly married and I help my father once a week by going over there and give a helping hand. I live close enough that a train ride isn't bad. But I have a career as well. So I've been trying to get back into gaming as a hobby to help take my mind off things. Or doing family activities. Anything that can free my mind helps.
I feel you. I was on track to go back to finish school now that I have money for it and my kids are old enough to feed themselves, then my dad moved in and I love him, but I’m not getting much help from my older sibling who wanted my parents to move here in the first place. My plans have been on hold now even working is out the window. 
I’ve gained weight, had angry outbursts that I immediately regretted, been very bitter towards the unhelpful sibling and right now have a lot going on that’s got me feeling like shit.
I wanna hug all of us who are soldiering on in this thing that was thrust upon us.
Same as all the above.  Lord, have mercy.
Same boat here. My father in law is ill, and we moved in with him shortly after we got married 2 years ago. 
My husbands started a business this year and I'm pregnant, and it is a juggling act working full time at home, being a carer, and growing a small human. I'm very tired. 

My husband doesn't get any help from his brother and is very stressed day to day, which is hard to watch. But we've been lucky to have other family members step in to help us and give us a small breather sometimes. Even just having them pop over to visit him for half an hour gives us a small break. 

The phrase 'it takes a village' shouldn't just apply to child raising, but to caring for dementia family members too.
I hope you're able to get some rest and reset soon.
I gave up on the idea of moving out into my own apartment.  I decided to stay in our family house and help my dad take care of my mom.  It worked okay for nearly 10 years.  Then Dad died suddenly, and I was on my own.

I just signed the papers to put my mom into an assisted living facility.  I feel guilty, like I’m giving up, and panic because I don’t really remember what life was like before caregiving.  Now I have to ‘start over again,’ and I don’t know how to do it.
Same boat, my friend. The only thing I can add to the many comments is try to take some time for yourself when your LO sleeps. Eat as healthy as you can, and take your vitamins (vitamins D and B12 have done wonders for my mood and energy).
My dad has dementia and my mom is basically the primary carer and I’m helping her. I work from home so it’s not too bad. If I want to go out and have some time for myself I’ll usually do it in the afternoon while he has his afternoon nap. I would ask my siblings if I’m planning for a longer, half a day outing with my friends. But usually it’s just my mom with him. I would usually come home with a lot of guilt because I’ve been out quite long.

Recently met a guy and just realised that I can’t do impromptu stuff with him and everything needs to be planned and I have to be home at a certain time (to help with bathing, bedtime, etc). Can only meet maybe once a week. I haven’t done any overnights on my own since mid 2020.
Every day is the same yet somehow worse as I watch my uncle struggle with this disease. Constantly exhausted by trying to bring order in all this chaos. I feel I've declined mentally and physically as I'm isolated with him all day and responsible for every aspect of his life while letting go my life. I don't mind sometimes when we've had a fair enough day and I've accomplished getting him showered or cooking a meal or taking him with me to the store without any issues. Sometimes I fear if this goes on any longer then I'm going to have a difficult time acclimating to socializing and getting a job. This is why I joined reddit as a distraction to give me something else to think about. I'm sorry OP your going through this life ruining disease,its so depressing. All my best and my sympathies to you❤
Now that we've just found out putting in her in a good home is financially impossible for us it will cost at least 60K a year, which she doesn't have. My mom has some money put aside but she'll burn through it in two years.  The state homes for her are horrible here. 

So it feels like my life has been put on hold for X amount of years to come, so another 9 max I believe.  What's that feeling again when you look forward to something in the future again ?  Well that's gone, so I feel trapped. 

I work from home and my sibling helps out when she can, for what she is personally going through I'm amazed she can still find the time to help.  So there's that.  But not being able to leave the house for no longer than 4hrs at a time is nice when I can get it, but I'm a like being outside type of person.   

Just depressed I guess, and emotionally tired.
I feel like right now I'm in a holding pattern to see what type of help and how much help I will need to provide in the nearish future. Right now everything seems stable, but I worry about my healthy parent and the toll the caregiving will take on them. They literally just got thru caring for their own mother who passed at almost 100 and had dementia at the end. Currently I'm trying to keep my own life pretty portable (remote work, limited personal belongings), but I have my own family as well to care for. One sibling will help when the time comes, but the other I'm not really sure. Trying to learn all I can about dementia and caregiving in the meantime.
I am experiencing an overload of emotions with no one to understand minus this group. 

Being a caretaker only magnifies all other outstanding projects or goals you want to achieve with so much pressure.

My body is starting to react. I want to keep up maintaining my well being because my mother did not and now it is fully my responsibility.",2022-03-30 01:10:25,Anticrepuscular_Ray,tryy3s
Dementia,What is life like post caregiver?,"This question for those of you who were a caregiver to a loved one but are no longer a caregiver anymore. 

The reason I ask is because my mother was my father’s caregiver. After he passed away,  I knew she would need time to adjust and find her path again but never did I think she would turn to drinking. Her drinking and behavior is very concerning to me. Is this common with other caregivers you know?

I’m well aware this may just be my mother’s problem but thought I would ask just in case.","[Caregiver Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7459858/) is a very real and common illness to occur in those caring for adult loved ones and patients.

Dementia,financial help,"I am trying to find out some information regarding finances for my in laws. 

My father in law has been recently diagnosed with dementia and will be going into a nursing home of some sort as his wife cannot care for him. She may not be too far behind him but at least for now she can stay at home with her daughter if needed be. He is a veteran of Vietnam and currently at the va hospital. They have very little money, basically just their social security, but they do own a home. I believe he has Medicare and va medical( not va disabled though). 


They are thinking of selling their home to help pay for a better nursing home, but i believe that insurance will not pay anything if they have money in the bank. Thus causing him to get a year of a better nursing home while making his wife lose her home. Or, they could just keep the house and not lose it? Also he made some poor financial decisions ( bought car on a credit card) before anyone realized he was suffering from dementia. Three card is in his name. 


So many questions, is there somewhere to get actually legit answers for finances in these circumstances?

Thank you so much for any help","Don't try and figure this out on your own.  Set up an appointment with an Elder Attorney who can explain all of this to you and assist in Medicaid Applications and VA info.  Good luck.
My mom was placed in a nursing home because my dad was unable to care for her at home. My sister and I did the financial aid paperwork and were given a priceless gift. My dad had opened a line of credit (not a good idea) to pay off my mother's credit card debt. When he did that, her name was not on the title or deed or loan, so she was able to get approved for Medicaid, so it turned worked out. The facility took her social security and and we had a set amount to pay from her pension each month.

Flip side, my dad developed dementia and the 5 of us decided that we were NOT going to place him, because we would have had to sell his home, use all his savings, take his pension, social security and the partial pension he was getting from mother's employer. I was his POA and we took care of him for 2 1/2 year 24/7 in his home until he died at home on hospice with his children, grands and great grands there, in June
Check with someone about this but I believe there is some sort of Medicaid rule that will let the spouse still live in the home. If that is correct, get him settled and IMMEDIATELY set up an ""Irrevocable Trust "" with an eldercare attorney and put the house in it!! Then, after 5 years, she will be able to get Medicaid and medicaid can't touch the house!",2022-03-29 21:31:43,forkandbowl,trv3od

I know I'm doing the right thing, but it feels so bad.","Sometimes we just don't have any other choice.  The disease makes it so hard to keep our loved ones at home with us.  It's impossible to live a ""normal"" life while you are caring for your husband at home.  You are still caring for him but in a different way.  You have made a very brave decision for him and he will be alright.  You and your children will also be alright once you all have  time to adjust to this new life. You will visit him and love him and know he is safe.  Take care of yourself and allow the tears then stand tall and move forward knowing you have always made the best decisions for him. Peace.
Lots of internet hugs to you.  I’m so sorry you are going through this right now. Knowing that it’s the right thing only helps so much.
It felt the same way with us. We tried to keep dad at home as long as we possibly could, but at some point it became clear he was a danger to himself every second he was alone.

Even now that he's in a foster home, I still think about him constantly. Great that he's got around-the-clock care, but the transition was really rough on him.

You'll make it. Lean on your kids and other family members for support. You're doing the right thing.
I am so, so sorry.  But you are doing the right thing.  He deserves professional care, and you deserve to have your life back.  It gets to a point where the care our LO needs is beyond our ability.  

Sending you hugs, love & light. 💜
I just signed the contract for my mom to enter an assisted living facility.  It’s the right thing to do for her, but I also feel like I’m falling apart inside.  There’s sadness, panic, and guilt.

Everyone says that it will get better, but I think it’s going to take a very long time for me to feel that way.
You'll be able to visit in a more relaxed way because you won't have to be the caregiver. You'll be able to spend time with him and make it count without worrying about if he got his meds, ate lunch, etc. It'll be hard, but it's probably a good choice.
((Virtual hug)) we were blessed, the five of us to take care of our dad at home, he was on home hospice when he died.

Dementia,"The Doll, or How I Learned I Cannnot Buy a Dementia Fix","I think many of us here have placed our hopes on something that would soothe, comfort or engage our loved ones with dementia.  I have learned, yet again, that dementia is a formidable foe.

My mother is getting into the later stages of dementia and is in memory care.  She's always loved dolls and babies and I thought I would get her one of those weighted baby dolls to cuddle and coo over.  I read all the reviews.  I made my Amazon purchase carefully, spending more money than one should for a doll.

It arrived.  It was adorable.  It was huggable and sweet faced and I couldn't wait to see my mother's reaction.  Oh, she loved it and exclaimed over it!  A true Hallmark moment.   Then, another resident came over to exclaim over the dear baby and its wee feet and soft skin.   She looked so wistfully at the doll in my mother's arms that I felt like Santa with an empty toy sack.

Sigh. That resident has no real family.  I felt terrible.   It was sad.  I went home and bought another doll and waited for the Amazon truck.

I bet you think a Hallmark moment is coming, don't you?

I took the doll over to memory care this morning...cue the violins swelling...!

Ha.  The lady wanted NOTHING to do with the doll.  She was having a day and rejected it.  I said to the staff, It's okay, if someone else would enjoy it...sigh...they can have it.  The staff said baby dolls were much loved and someone would surely enjoy it.  They added my mother was crazy about hers.

I checked in on my mom in her room.  No baby doll.  I asked, Where is the baby doll? 

""What doll?"" She asked in confusion.  I said, ""The new baby doll!"" as I started my search through the closet and under the bed.  My mom said, ""Someone stole it""  just as I opened her nightstand to find the poor doll crammed in the lower drawer.   

She was surprised to see it but told me to take it away, someone would want it and steal it!

On my way out, I saw a resident had fallen asleep cuddling the other doll.  

There's no Hallmark moment in dementia.  There are things we can buy to make our loved ones' lives easier, but as I have learned, we can buy dolls or fidget blankets or memory marker boards or therapeutic mechanical cats and none of it will make a bit of difference to the person who has no idea where they are or who their family is or that they used to have hobbies and careers.

All we can do is our best, but don't take it personally if the things you are trying aren't working!","The potentially ""good"" news in this, if your mom's dementia works anything like mine, is that you can always ""re-give"" her the doll and it'll be like Christmas morning all over again. 

The doll might've been put in a drawer by a kind overnight worker-- maybe the doll fell on the floor overnight. Your mom might have said ""I didn't want it to get stolen"" on auto-pilot, as a way to cover that she didn't remember the doll or how it got into the drawer. 

(again, this is all based on what my mom would say/do.)

You are a kind soul. Thank you for buying a doll for the other resident. 

(Once Mom moved to hospice and passed, I wasn't sure what to do with the comforting things that we bought her in her final weeks. We donated them to the hospice unit so they could comfort other residents.)
Aww. Well—""Hallmark moment"" is about memory. And someone with dementia has no capacity for that. You did make two people happy… for a bit. And then another two, and another two, each time for a moment. 

It's kind of like the starfish story. A bunch of beached starfish stranded, baking, dying at low tide. Child begins tossing them one by one back into the water. Adult happens by, asks ""why bother? There are so many starfish, you can't make a difference."" Child responds by chunking another starfish in the water, saying ""I made a difference for *that* one.""
Oh, so sorry.  This disease is such a bitch.  You just never know minute to minute what you will get from someone with dementia.  You love her, you are doing your best, you are learning that the disease decides everything and we are just along for the ride.
Appreciate this a lot right now. Big hugs
So true. Everything gets smashed into a drawer whether it belongs there or not. Wreaths, wall decorations, holiday decorations, big blankets, stuffed animals, etc. All because she doesn't want someone to steal from her. My family member has pulled off at least 4 drawer fronts trying to open over-stuffed drawers.
It's a brutal and sad disease and I really hope there is some peace and happiness found once they pass. It makes no sense why some are afflicted and some aren't. Like for instance my nanas both had alzheimers one passed at 84 and my other 80 year old nana is in the late-stages in the rest home she's non verbal, can't walk, and is really suffering daily with the disease. My nana is a really kind loving, caring, person who never deserved this disease. She never drank alcohol often or used drugs or committed any crime or harmed anything or anyone in her life she was a really good person and spent alot of her time reading, gardening, walking in nature and caring for her children. I don't know why good people have to suffer, and for instance my grandad is the total opposite to good he's a cheeky, manipulative, schemeing man he has Narcassistic personality disorder and he is now getting dementia quite quickly at age 85 but still trying to scheme and create issues. It's just sad how it's survival of the fittest and good people get walked all over and suffer whereas bad people triumph and live longer.
Thank you for sharing.
Very helpful post. Thanks...and all the best to you and your mom.
You did have a hallmark moment it was just temporary. But it did happen for her
Aww. This made me more than a little sad and contemplative. My dad is heading that way and I thought we would have more time but yesterday, he suddenly looked at my sister in confusion and wondered who she was. My sister was scolding her daughter who is named after me, and my dad perked up. He seemed relieved to know someone and also seemed eager to have me show up to take him away from all these people he suddenly didn’t know. He asked where I was and my sister explained to him that this one is HER daughter and my dad’s daughter (me) is sitting at the back. 
My dad looked over in my direction and I stayed partially turned away from him, but waved my hand where he could see and said “I’m over here dad.” 

I felt so bad for him but I was afraid he would be more confused and agitated if he saw and didn’t recognize the me now. The more time I spend with my dad, the more scary and heartbreaking it is. I went from being angry a lot at his outbursts (completely unlike him) to now feeling so damn bad.

I hope you have more good days than bad. Bless your heart for donating the other doll to one who needs it. Hugs for all of you here.
That's very sad and all too familiar. In the last months of my Uncle's dementia, I was struggling to think of a Christmas gift and finally remembered one of his favorite candies. One that he couldn't get easily for himself and I knew I had a winner. I bought a big 3lb box of treats and, indeed, he absolutely loved it on Christmas morning. And, in fact, enjoyed those treats constantly for the weeks following Christmas.

Finally, on one of my visits in early January he asked me ""What am I supposed to do with all of this?"", indicating the box of treats. I said that he loved them and he'd been eating them almost constantly. He told me to take them away and that he never wanted to see them again and he couldn't understand why anyone would buy him so much of something like that. And, anyone that's been around dementia knows how angry he was too, right? I mean, he wasn't kidding and he was absolutely illogical and angry about these treats now. Incredibly sad and frustrating. You just cannot win with dementia. I guess I'm glad that he got some enjoyment from them for a while.
That was so beautifully written. 

I don't know how this would work for you - how about taking it to the car each night and bringing it back with you the next day? I do wonder about why she was worried it would get stolen. The fear of that overwhelmed the pleasure. But if you kept it...? Just a thought.
My wife was in the early stages of dementia. One night I made a nice meal of ravioli. It was good quality ravioli, and I made it look good on the plate. I felt good about paying attention to the details not thinking she’d notice, but it made me feel good to treat her like she is special.

I gave her the plate and went to the kitchen to fix mine. I came back and her food was all gone. I asked her how she liked it, fishing for praise, and she said it was really good.

I ate a bite of mine and our big Labrador dog came over to beg (my wife trained him well!) and the dog promptly threw up on my feet. The whole plateful of unchewed ravioli. 

Definitely not a Hallmark moment.
You have hit the nail on the head.

My mum would not want 'things' cos they will be 'stolen'.  

Possibly your mum hid the doll to keep it safe and forgot about it.  I would find things 'hidden' in drawers and handbags... even fruit or half a sandwich..

I left cuddly dogs and soft bodied dolls in full view in her room till she sort of started recognizing them as hers and safe where they were. Or  just the further decline.  The cheaper items were the ones she preferred to the 'breathing puppy' and such.

My mum was a pediatric nurse.  Breaks my heart yet again when she holds her fave doll 'correctly'... and indeed the fave doll is soft bodied and came from a thrift store..

So kind of you to bring happiness with your gift of the doll to another resident.

So sorry you're going through this same hell.
She might have sincerely put the doll in the drawer to protect it and forgot she did that. It sounds like she loved it. And other residents may have been grabbing for it or whatever. It’s probably a little like taking your favorite toy to preschool with you and getting upset when others want to hog it. The other woman might love hers too and was just having a bad day. I think what you did was great. I’d be pumped if someone gave me a doll when I’m an old lady lol. I always adored my dolls as a kid and I think I’d be so excited to have another especially if living away from family.

Dementia,My mother died a few hours ago,"She was sent to a rehab hospice three hours from her home. She couldn't get any water or good down at the end and quickly deteriorated.  Dementia and cancer of the stomach.  

I didn't want to go but I did.  She was unforgiving and controlling for all my life. But now, just a frail body almost ready to shut off.  Because hearing goes last, I sang some of her favorite songs, including the old ones she loved in church.  Then I told her I forgave her.  

She died about an hour later.","I am so, so, so sorry. 

Losing our moms, especially when our relationship was difficult, is really hard. 

You did the right thing, no doubt. You brought her comfort, and you will find that your actions will bring YOU comfort, knowing you were there and helping keeping her calm and soothed in her final moments.

When mom was awful or controlling, I always kept telling myself ""She's doing what she thinks is best... and even if I hate it, and even if it's shitty, she is doing only what she knows how to do.""  That kinda helped a bit. 

My mom passed this past fall, and the ache never goes away, but it does get less painful and stabby. She was your mom, and she always will be.  May the good memories bring you comfort.
That was a nice thing for you to do and I hope being able to apologize brings you some kind of peace, it's very hard to process right near the end when it's very quick.
Sorry for you pain, I lost my mother 2 years ago for almost the same reason. 

Peace and understanding comes from within. As your healing process starts, remember she isn't in pain anymore. 

God be with you.
Man I’m so sorry for your loss. 
I myself am dealing with a complicated grieving process. My dad died of cancer in Jan and he had a mistress my age and left us a big big mess . My mom also has dementia so it’s quite difficult
My condolences. Wishing you love and light. ❤️
So so sorry for your loss! Bless you for forgiving her and being by her side. ((((Hugs))))",2022-03-29 16:10:33,Littlebiggran,trhr03
Dementia,My mother died just before noon.,,"Sorry for you loss.
Now it's finally over - go enjoy the rest of your life now. Families that care for oved ones with dementia definitely deserve it.
Sorry for your loss
I'm very sorry for your loss. I am in a similar situation and it's such a mix of emotions. There are so many things to do and there's almost a disbelief that this is finally happening. It all feels very disorienting. Going through the motions that you knew you would eventually have to go through. And, knowing what the eventual outcome was to be but not expecting when it comes. Again, almost a sense of disbelief that this is happening now. Very strange. The sadness that comes from the passing but also knowing what dementia was doing to our loved one. Wanting them back but not wanting them to continue going through what they were. It's a pretty terrible situation with no good answers or solutions.
I'm sorry for your loss, OP 🕊
My condolences. Her fight is finally over. Take good care of yourself
Sorry.  Just went through/ still going through this even though my mom passed just over a week ago
My condolences for your loss. 

You've done more than enough, been more than enough. Gone through more than enough. 

Take the next few days to rest, sleep and find some kind of center for yourself.
I’m SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSE!!! 🥺🥺 Going through this awful nightmare as well. It seems everyone on this site is going through the exact same thing. All of our stories sound the same! SO DAMN HEARTBREAKING!!!!! 😡 I HATE this disease!!!! It doesn’t just affect your loved one but also the family members! Ugh...so exhausting!
My condolences
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry for your loss. I know there are many emotions going through your head. I've been through this. Part of you wishes she is still here and another part of you feels relieved.

Give yourself time to grieve. Don't let anyone tell you that you need to move on. Everyone is different. Take all the time you need for yourself. Praying for you.
Congratulations. Enjoy your freedom and your life.

I hope her condition had not progressed to/past the point where the mom you knew and loved was unrecognizable, but alas - I have my doubts.
Sorry for your loss
I am sorry for your loss.
I am sincerely sorry for your loss. May she be at peace  and may you find peace as well. I know how difficult it is to lose a loved one, but the only thing you can do is take it one day at a time, step by step. My heart goes out to you.
Sorry",2022-03-29 15:51:39,Littlebiggran,trfzsy
Dementia,Insight flash: it's probably constipation!,"My partner has dementia and lots of anxiety and depression. She seems to sundown mornings. This morning was pretty bad. She's struggled with constipation on & off, though we eat decently high fiber. She probably forgets to drink water, and doesn't want to exacerbate urinary incontinence. On a hunch, I asked ""when's the last time you pooped?"" Three-four days ago. Ah-hah! Will work on that, see if it helps! Thought it might be useful to share.

Update. It wasn't just constipation. She's being crabby and anxious after the Main Event too. 😖","Probiotics help with constipation. My very private aunt, pre-dementia, finally admitted to us that she has been suffering from constipation for decades. I recommended probiotics; she refused, saying nothing can help. After a hospital stay 8 months later, she again complained.  I bought her some probiotics, opened the container, handed her the pills and said “as an experiment, take them for 2 weeks.” She finally agreed and rarely gets constipated now. When she does, she adds 1 tsp of MCT oil to her oatmeal or milkshake. Before dementia, she called them a life saver.
All of the sudden my wife was inexplicably losing weight with serious diarrhea. Doctors did a complete work up on her digestive system, nothing. Six months later she is taking constipation medicine.
Mom couldn't tell me if she pooped today or not.  I have no way of knowing.
constipation usually causes an upset tummy so if my dad suddenly doesn't want to eat anything and is more lethargic than usual I will give him a laxative.",2022-03-29 11:32:50,108beads,tr4p78
Dementia,"Dementia: Prescribed Zoloft AND Lexapro together, is this normal?!","Hi all - my father was recently diagnosed with dementia, and he is hallucinating daily. Small children in the house, men cutting down trees in the backyard, etc. I suspected Lewy Body Dementia b/c of the early hallucinations, but the doctor ruled this out due to him not having tremors. I am suspicious he has LBD, but for now it has been ruled out I guess. The reason I am writing is b/c he suspected his new memory medicine (Rivastigmine/Exelon) was exacerbating his hallucinations, so he is switching him to Donezipil/Aricept.  But my question, is that he is adding 5 mg of Lexapro, and my Dad already takes 100 mg of Zoloft. My mom inquired about this, taking two antidepressants together, and the doctor assured her that it is ""fine, and the Lexapro should help with the hallucinations....""

I'm no doctor, obviously, but as someone familiar with antidepressants, I've never heard of Lexapro helping with hallucinations - much less being combined with such a high dose of Zoloft. Does this sound legit to be mixing two antidepressants in a patient with dementia? Thanks in advance for any insight or experience.","Wife 59 was diagnosed with Lewy bodies originally. Then last year her anger and belligerence associate with her hallucinations and conspiracy theories was getting out of control. Based on her behavior and no additional tests, her neurologist changed the diagnosis to FTD. She was prescribed Zoloft and it worked incredibly well. But I was constantly increasing the dosage chasing good behavior. Eventually she started having toxic side effects. She is now taking Zoloft morning and night with Quetiapine being her main antipsychotic. Quetiapine does not work as well as Zoloft for my wife, but there doesn’t seem to be toxicity problems. She also takes trazodone to help with sleeping through the night. 

I hope this was helpful.
Disclaimer: Not a doctor; internet strangers aren't good sources of medical advice.

Not (from my limited experience) a problem. Max dose Zoloft 200 mg, max Lexapro 20 mg. Both are SSRIs, which you probably know. Combo would like not be a starting point for Rx, but in limited circumstances worth considering. (Dosing info from  https://www.drugs.com/professionals.html)

However, I would want to know more from the doc about why 2 meds are being changed at the same time: the Exelon/Aricept swap *and* the addition of Lexapro. 

Reason: my experience has been/best practice seems to be, make one meds tweak, and wait, watch. How long to wait is determined by how long a drug reaches blood plasma stable concentration. If no change in problem and/or no side effects, *then* proceed to titrate in a second medication.

Otherwise, it's hard to tell which of the new drugs is causing either good or poor effects.

There may be a perfectly decent explanation for the ""two at once"" Rx change. On the other hand, I've encountered impatient psychiatrists (possibly goaded by impatient patients) who want a good outcome ASAP. I've personally had better results with slow-and-steady, but YMMV.
Mine is taking multiple antidepressants and multiple antipsychotics. Sometimes an antidepressant is used as an antipsychotic
Glad you’re here.
Lexapro is sometimes used before antipsychotics like quetiapine or risperidone. Antipsychotics have more side effects than SSRI’s typically, so many providers like to exhaust their options before moving to these. Sometimes adding more serotonin can help with hallucinations, but sometimes it doesn’t.
I’m sure it’s fine if prescribed. Doc is probably trying to give an extra kick. Whatever you do don’t stop the Zoloft. I take the same amount btw and I’m pretty small. I don’t think it’s a particularly high dose, pretty typical I think.
Sorry your dad is going through this!

 Hallucinations are not isolated to lewy body dementia.  Almost everyone with Alzheimer's disease will experience hallucinations at varying degrees.  That said, a tremor is certainly not required for lewy body dementia. Rivastigmine should not exacerbate hallucinations, it typically helps control them.  Is his doctor a neurologist?

There's really nothing much to worry about typically with two ssris especially if the Lexapro is only at 5 mg.  However, Lexapro is probably not going to help with hallucinations. 

Seroquel is usually the ideal choice since it will not cause parkinsonism",2022-03-29 10:29:25,OnlyAd5847,tr10vb

Dementia,I'm a bad person,"My dad has dementia. He's in his 60s and this last year he was getting more and more needy. I can barely take care of myself and so I bolted. Totally stopped all communication. We used to be ""close"" but fought perpetually so I don't know if it was genuine or if it was just an automatic attempt to survive. I feel guilt for abandoning him but also am terrified at the thought of getting back in touch. I'm afraid it'll go right back to all this weight being thrust onto me by a belligerent angry man. I know he has people who take care of him but I feel pity at all of us kids leaving him to die alone. My stomach hurts I feel so guilty but I can't bring myself to talk to him again. I think I've spoken to my dad for the last time ever and I feel sick about it. I don't know what the right thing to do is. Do I willingly go back and let my own mental health slip again just to ease my conscious? Or do I ignore the guilt since I'm doing better-ish after cutting off communication?","Write letters to him.  Tell him what you've been up to. Write about good things you remember.   You can communicate with your father without havng to endure how he might speak to you.
I don't think there is a ""right"" way to handle this, just what seems less bad to you. The way you describe it, either way (continuing no-contact or reaching back out) sounds hard. You could flip a coin and just do a gut-check. It sounds like he might not have been a great parent before the dementia (if I'm understanding you correctly), and it also sounds like you're struggling to maintain boundaries (in that your communication is all or nothing). I would check your pity--is it because you'd hate to be in his position, or is it really for him?
We aren’t all built to take care of our parents, and it sounds like yours wasn’t great to begin with. You’re not obligated to care for him, do what is best for your mental health, bc this path is the hardest I’ve walked and wouldn’t wish it on anyone.
You are not a ""bad"" person. IMO, no such thing. From what you've written, you are a struggling person with competing moral imperatives. In a nutshell, self preservation vs. filial piety. Bad behavior may be your best (largely subconscious) guess at defensive strategy. 

Talk with a therapist for better insights into strategies you can use to maintain your sanity and offer love. If not a therapist, try the Alzheimer Association's 24 hour helpline, 800.272.3900. (The dementia type does mot have to be Alzheimer's.)
Do yourself a favor let the guilt go knowing he has folks to take care of him that is what is important Dementia is a very cruel illness it will suck you in and spit you out and will not care how you feel period.
You obviously care about your father and have love for him but you need to know that you need your own healthy State of mind I take care of my mom and I do it all by myself 24/7 365 days a year the only one that said to me I don't think it's a good idea was my mother-in-law she was right she said it was a task too large for me to do by myself and I should have listened to her I've given up everything where I lived my family my job basically my life to take care of her she just left went to Minnesota for 30 years and all of a sudden because she's my mother and I didn't want to leave my mother out there alone I decided to take care of her and she is not very nice to me do yourself a favor live your life
You're not a bad person. It sounds like you did what you could but had to leave to take care of your own mental health. At least you know that people are there to take care of him.

 I'd say that I don't feel guilt is healthy for your emotional and mental health either. Have you considered limiting your contact but making some effort to ease the guilt you feel? Perhaps you can get in touch with his caretakers periodically just to ask about him and see if he's okay from a distance. You could send him some basic supplies or something he likes without physically seeing him.
You may even be okay with a periodic call to him. Consider what level of contact you're comfortable with and do what feels right for you.",2022-03-29 08:40:42,-Joyismymiddlename-,tqyuyt
Dementia,Stolen items,"Over the years, my mum (64) has accused several people of coming into her property and stealing things such as jewellery, clothing, toiletries, cleaning products etc.

She has often accused my dad of conspiring with others and allowing them to take these items for whatever reason. When I've quizzed her on it, her 'go to' reason often ends up with, ""He's trying to mess with my head.""

We've taken her to the GP in the past who have said she's  showing early signs of dementia but that's all. They prescribed her some medication for anxiety/depression and that was it.

Things have only gotten worse over the years and she has often ostracized herself from her family members, in particular, her sisters, who have often been recipients of her wild accusations. They have all been very supportive but they have felt a lot of pain from the wild accusations that she has thrown at them as well.

She will often refuse to leave the house in fear of something going missing. She won't want my dad to leave her side.

I don't know if anyone can help... Just wondering, if anyone has faced anything similar? If you have, (or even if you haven't), any advice/suggestions would be very welcome.","Our case isn't as extreme. But she would accuse me of stealing or an ominous ""someone"". And it was just her misplacing items. We had to stop letting her carry cash because she began hiding it in her shoes in the closet (she hid hundreds of $$). It also seemed to go hand in hand with her angry outburst. For us, the doctor put her on a low dose of Citalopram and that has done well. She may need a different medication if the one she is on has not helped. Generally it does fall into the 2 weeks to a month to see any changes. If it isn't helping, discuss it with her GP. They might try her on something else.
My mother also did this. Accused various people of stealing remotes, panties, you name. I placed cameras in her house when she was living alone and it kinda helped ease my fears but it just kept coming. Moved her in with us, and she continue to accuse her grandkids of taking money, etc. not as bad since she is on lexipro now, but I know when something is “missing” that means she hid it, and now doesn’t remember where it went. I no longer give her cash because she hid it. It’s just part of the cycles
I was where you are now 4 years ago. My mom refused to leave home unless someone was there to keep an eye on things because random people were stealing all of this imaginary stuff that was right where she'd left it. It worked out for us because my brother lived with her and my husband and I could come take her somewhere and give him a break while he kept an eye on things. She tried accusing my sister who had POA of spending all of her money on gravel for her driveway. I had to remind her that the driveway graveling was her Christmas present from all of us and that didn't reassure her so much as it made her wary of me too. She never completely got over that phase but it got easier to manage, whether that was her not being as diligently paranoid or us getting thicker skins, I'm not sure.

The hard part was dealing with her accusations of and to people who either had no idea she had dementia and hadn't spoken to her in years or the deniers who bought into her tales because they never saw the dementia behaviors, even though they were told. Nothing quite makes your day like your aunt who comes around every couple of months accusing you of trying to convince your mom she's crazy to steal her farm. Or people you spent every Sunday in church with for your entire childhood questioning why you're taking your mom's freedom away when she's obviously just fine- why, they spend a whole hour and a half a week with her, they should know! Thankfully the neighbor she was accusing of shooting her cats (her house cats that were often in her lap when she'd call to tell me he'd just shot them all) when I decided he needed to know what was up with her because she'd been saying she was going to call him and chew him out for killing all of her cats, was very understanding and genuinely sad that she wasn't herself any more.
Thank you to those who've responded.

Just wondering, does it get worse?
Lots of accusations . I’ve stopped reasoning and best to change subject or lie to temporarily stop the questioning . She will say these aren’t my shoes . And I’ll just say oh I bought them for u today jusy for you to stop the arguing . Or if she asks where her jewelry is (had to be taken away so she doesn’t lose it ), I’ll say it’s in the safe at bank etc",2022-03-29 08:16:00,riznad,tqyfsq
Dementia,Trying to help/Is it dementia?,"I've spent almost two hours typing and trying to re-type out a description that accurately explains everything, but I don't want to taint it with my current frustrations, I just need help.

My mom takes handfuls (by her own description, in front of me) of cough medicine pills every day. She's on two anti-seizure meds, one of which is supposedly to help with mania (again, only according to her). Plus years of heavy alcoholism

But her behavior has changed drastically within the last 3 months (long after the start of drug use). She's started picking fights, with me, my stepdad, her sister, anyone who disagrees with her, even over the slightest of things. What concerns me is that every time these fights break out, she very, very quickly breaks into tears, seems to get confused, and accuses whoever she's fighting with of thinking she's crazy. At one point during one of the last few fights, she said ""All the women in my family have gone to insane asylums"", fully unprompted, in an argument about spending habits. 

I guess first: Are any of these things signs of dementia, or do y'all think it might just be drug use issues?

If these are signs of dementia, is it possible that my mom, a smart, aware person for most of her life, is starting to notice the decline, and these fights are a reaction to her fear? (secondary question: If so, what can I do to help?)","Honestly, sounds more like a substance abuse issue, but there’s no way to determine if she has dementia until she stops drinking and popping unprescribed meds. Is she diagnosed bipolar that’s she’s on prescription meds for mania?  Or is she self-medicating? I mean, there’s a lot to unpack here.
Glinda has a good point.  

But does your mom: 
•repeat herself (memory looping) several times within minutes?
•frequently misplace things like car keys?
•have trouble with her finances (balancing checkbook, missing payments)?
•is she buying the same things over and over again
•getting lost in familiar places?
•is her personal hygiene getting bad?

The above things are some of the behaviors my late mom exhibited.

Alcoholism and drug abuse can cause dementia. 

She needs to go see a doctor and they can evaluate her.  

In the meantime, start making sure she has a designated Power of Attorney, Advanced Healthcare/Medical Directive in place.  If she has her own bank  account (separate from her husband), have a trusted family member added to it so they can track her finances when she can’t anymore.
Have her checked for a UTI or any other infection. It can heighten confusion. And the cold meds are probably not helping you could get basically drunk on them at a certain point. Is it true that the women in her family have had mental health problems? Getting checked for whatever they had might be good too. But it also sounds like she is afraid of having her mind go. I’d check depression and anxiety too. Just ask her GP to run a whole screen.
This doesn’t really sound like dementia, but it’s hard to say. Polypharmacy, especially in older adults, can cause confusion. I think a great first step for your family would be for her to see her PCP with you (or another family member) present.
Most over the counter cough syrups contain Dextromethorphan which shouldn’t be taken with alcohol because it exacerbates side effects. Google regular side effects, then Google effects when someone abuses. I’m not a doctor but it seems like many of her symptoms are related to her addiction to cough syrups. Talk to your pharmacist and doctor to see how to safely wean her off of them. Your pharmacist may be able to provide you with some placebo “sugar pills” for her to take instead of the Dextromethorphan.",2022-03-29 03:12:29,IneedaFuture,tqu3x6
Dementia,Im a city bus driver...wandering passenger,"Im a city bus driver. Today I had to call it in for a confused passenger. Ive never dealt with one before.  I dont even know if this customer has dementia.

The customer was going to work. But he had no idea where his workplace was, what street name it was, what bus number to take or even what metro station to get off at. I asked him whether today was his first day of work and he said no, he's gone to work often.

Oddly enough, he knew the name of his workplace (which wasnt helpful) and the phone number of his sister and his home address.

Is it possible for him to have dementia yet still have good memory of other things? Could it be possible that he's not even employed and simply thinks he's going to work?

As I was driving my bus, he kept wanting to get off my bus and wander about random neighbourhoods to see if he could find his workplace. I absolutely did not want this man to get off my bus. As I drove, I said no that's not a good idea. I dont want you to get lost outside. Its freezing outside. Please wait, I have someone coming to help you find your workplace ok? IT TOOK A LOT FOR ME TO CONVINCE HIM TO STAY ON MY BUS UNTIL SUPERVISORS/POLICE ARRIVED. But he ultimately said he trusts me to help him and sat down.

I dont know what happened to him ultimately, but does this sound like a case of dementia? Did I do everything right?","You absolutely did everything right and probably saved his life and his family from worrying about his disappearance. It could be dementia, but there are other kinds of illnesses that can cause things like temporary amnesia. Thank you for looking out for him!
Kudos to you...you may have saved his life, and his family was probably worried sick wondering where he was. This is very common in dementia patients -- the long-term memories/muscle memory goes last, so he was probably just following muscle memory. I'm sure he's getting the help he needs now.
Having worked with many dementia patients, it is very common for them to want to go to work. Often we would give them small jobs to do and then tell them its time for a coffee/lunch break. Thank you for having the patience to help this person. As others have said you may have saved his life.
Even if it was another type of medical emergency occurring that was messing with his mind and memory, you definitely did the right thing. Keeping him safe and getting him help was the best procedure.
Thank you so much. You basically just described my father. He's a kind guy, but still wants to go to work and be useful. He doesn't wander much, but it's like his brain is randomly assembling the few pieces that he can connect with, and building a scenario out of them. 

He goes to adult daycare, but thinks he's volunteering at the foodbank, lol. snif. ""We were waiting around all day for them to find something for us to do. Finally I started putting together a puzzle they had. Kind of a waste of time.""
Yes, and you might have saved his life. Thank you.
Thankyou so much, good on you, that must have been so stressful for you!  It's alarming & can be a bit traumatising even, to realise that someone out alone is so completely lost & confused about what they're doing.  You did really well!   

My (89yr old) mum recently wandered off from me at a small shopping mall on a major road, I was going nuts searching around for her.  She has a 'Safe Return' bracelet (similar to what diabetics / epileptics have) to ID her to Emergency First Responders, but no GPS tracker, no mobile phone, didn't have my number on her.  After an hour I called cops.  It was a pretty hot day here in Australia.  We found her 2km away up the road at another mall, a bystander had seen her wandering searching through the huge car park in baking hot sun & recognised a lost dementia oldie so he corralled her to safety.  She was searching for my car, neither myself nor she could figure out why she even walked out & up to the other mall.  I was very grateful to him.    Thankyou!
If my poor mom was to ever wander away from us I would be forever grateful if someone like you was to find her and care enough to keep her as safe as you did that man. Thank you so much for being a good human.
Aw good job not letting him off in the cold. It’s sweet that he decided to trust you. It’s possible to have dementia and still remember an important phone number or address at certain stages.
Big hug to you OP! You did great. Good job not letting him wonder away in the cold. I live in New England and it's a big fear for me that dad will wonder off in the cold.
You are a hero!  Thanks so much for your kindness and concern.  

Yes, people with dementia can have very selective memory.  Your passenger might have vivid memories of working at Acme Corp, but not that he retired 10 years ago.   

Again, thanks so much!
Thank you so much for what you did. That could have been my father out there. 

My dad can tell you his birthday and social security number without hesitation. He cannot tell you the names of his kids. I tell people that his memory is like Swiss cheese. It's solid in some areas and has holes in others.
Absolutely you did the most amazing thing anyone could. My grandma has dementia and she has “good” and bad days. Some days she’s coherent and understand where she is but other days can’t remember what she ate 2 mins ago.  It’s extremely common that you had to use a lot of patience/understanding as their brain cannot process information the same way as someone who doesn’t have this disease. It makes me happy to see others helping others.
Curious , how old was the man ?  Good on you for taking the time to take care of someone who needed help. Thanks !",2022-03-29 00:09:16,givemean95,tqrdcv
Dementia,Dementia and bipolar,"My mother has been living with bipolar disorder her whole life (mainly controlled with medication), unfortunately she had to come off meds due to damage caused and in 2021 had a manic episode which required hospitalization. Usually her episodes are \~3 months, but this one went on for over 12 months. In addition to bipolar she had regular TIAs 'mini strokes' for several years and had Covid-19 last year too. 

There has been a significant decline in her cognitive function and she has now been diagnosed with dementia at age 68. The doctors indicate that bipolar disorder combined with TIAs and other health issues have collectively damaged her brain over time. Before the latest manic episode she had fine cognitive function except for the occasional memory slip.

It seems like very sudden onset, more like a stroke than what I understand from dementia. She has lost most communication, all motivation/interest in anything, poor mobility, a good chunk of memories (although hard to test since she doesn't communicate much). She paces back and forth, has panic attacks, rocks back and forth, but doesn't really do much or speak much and it's hard to get her involved in anything. Basically the symptoms seem quite advanced for her age and the fact this has come on following a manic episode is leaving me confused - it feels like she has jumped forward about 20 years over night!

I also worry about my family as my dad is now essentially a full time carer and he's not young either. I am trying to offer support but don't know how. I am still coming to terms with the diagnosis, but I am interested to hear from others whose parents have had dementia, and especially anyone who has seen bipolar with dementia or experienced this speed of progression.","There are types of dementia that aren't the ""typical"" types, strokes and blood flow problems in the brain can cause it. At the best of times, a timeline for progression is impossible. I've been through it several times with family members and some older friends and some progressed slowly, some skipped steps and stages completely. I do know with my brother after he had a stroke, it took a while to get himself sorted to get functionality back somewhat to what it was before. He went from being a part-stroke 45 year old who threw himself on the floor at our parents' house kicking and screaming in a full toddler-style tantrum because Dad was watching something on TV and wouldn't let him change channels to being able to live on his own and driving again. 

Your mom may take a while to bounce back or she may just have too much going at once and this is her new normal. Only time will tell.
Was she on any form of benzos that she recently came off from too rapidly? 

I dealt with the same thing 3 years ago, and still in the midst of caregiving for my cognitively impaired mum. I’ still not sure if its dementia or not, but it was the same rapid onset after the doctor cold turkeyed her off benzos. Became confused overnight. Tons of anxiety and panic and memory issues, poor executive functioning. And she was manic for the better part of last year, but it’s been leveling out now the more i slowly taper her off valium after reinstating her. 

Right now we are in a better place. She was catatonic for almost 2 years, but now she speaks and has her own initiative and motivations, and chases her favourite tv dramas and can actually follow tv plots again, tho still far from her old self and far from being able to be independent. I used to have to do everything for her, like she had late stage dementia, but now she just requires supervision and i can tell her to do something like brush her teeth and she can execute the steps herself, compared to at her worst when i had to break down steps one by one (put ur hand at the tap, lift up the lever, etc as compared to turn on the water kind of instructions. Even then sometimes she struggled. She had alot of problems understanding simple things.)

The doctor thinks it’s FTD but im not so sure. There’s definitely frontal lobe damage, but i personally think it was from the drug withdrawal shock that caused some sort of chemical stroke rather than a typical neurodegenerative disease. Been a tough 3 years what with covid going around and all, but it’s weird to witness this slow process, feels like dementia in reverse. I dont know if ill get her back but at this point i take what i can get. Feels good to get abit of her back, but really afraid itll progress into full dementia. 

Your case sounds like what i went through. If she was on any form of benzos and was rapidly taken off, then thats probably something that contributed to her rapid decline. Google the ashton’s manual to see if that’s something you can relate to? Though if it is, Im not sure how this knowledge would help you find your way forward. But i suppose knowing is half the battle. All the best.
My aunt was never diagnosed with bipolar but I wouldn’t be surprised if she had been. My aunt is doing something similar after adding Namenda and an organic, omega 3 refrigerated crème syrup we found at Whole Foods. She passed out and hit her head about a year ago, and I believe she had a series of mini strokes around Christmas due to the rapid decline that I witnessed. All of a sudden, she just sat and watched tv, rarely spoke. Anyway, she could no longer make toast. Soon after starting with the Namenda, she would say “my toast is done” when the toaster oven dinged but she couldn’t make it over to the toaster oven. Instead, she went over to the silverware drawer several times. I asked what she needed - a knife to put butter on her toast (there was a tub of butter with a knife on top of it right in front of her. I walked over to the toaster oven, touched it and said “your toast is done,” and she walked over, removed it and buttered her own toast. She’s been able to do it herself ever since. It’s weird how many of her thought processes have been scrambled but when I model the behavior once or twice, she’s been able to pick the skill back up. I also believe going for a walk almost every day has helped.

My husband (59yo) has been a bipolar 30 years. 4 yrs ago he had a bad manic episode and it took multiple hospitalizations over 2 months to stabilize him.  The resulting meds caused him daytime sleepiness (he would sleep 20 hours a day) and constant tremors, falls, short-term memory issues, & high-level thinking was impacted, etc.

We had to move to another state (formerly NM, now MD) to find competent Drs. To help him change meds.   He isn’t well, but is gradually becoming more functional. He is seeing a new psychiatrist who has slowly reduced and changes some meds (benzos).

We have seen a neurologist and now another that specializes in movement disorders.

The reality is, there is no magic drug combination, everyone is different. He will ALWAYS have tremors because of the types of meds he must take to keep from going manic. This movement doctor did prescribe a tremor med, and suggested a further reduction in benzos and removal of Lithium over time.

This gives us hope.",2022-03-28 20:08:35,Odd-Philosopher-1578,tqn1wj
Dementia,Looking for advice about putting Dad in a home,"My dad has a brain tumor that has cause a cognitive decline over the past 2 years. During all this he’s had Covid and been hospitalized and almost died TWICE. Because of Covid, his cancer treatments have been put on hold twice. Right now we aren’t sure when they will resume. His hematologist oncologist wants to leave him be for now to let him recover from Covid. If he declines more, then we will address it. 

Currently he is in the Veteran Affairs hospital. He’s 100% disabled veteran. They are going to admit him to CLC (Community Living Center) as a temporary resident for rehab. The idea is once he’s stronger he will come home. However, they told us he could be a permanent resident and he qualifies for free as a VA benefit. 

He currently lives with my 72 year old mom. Taking care of him is killing her. She has given up her life to take care of him 24/7 because of his cognitive decline. 

I’m pretty sure I can convince her to transition him to permanent resident. How do I convince my siblings that this is okay. I have 3 brothers? I’m sure they would all hate me for pushing this and thinking I have an agenda. We all live out of state. So none of us can help my mom take care of my dad regularly. 

My only agenda is to save my mom and give her, her life back. She’s physically healthy and mentally sharp. There’s no reason why she should stop living while he verbally abused and bullies her everyday because he doesn’t know any better.","It seems as though the professionals at the hospital believe your father will likely never go home again.  Have a meeting with them and invite your siblings, since they are not in the area perhaps a phone conference so they all know this is what the professionals say and not just you. You are 100% spot on about your Mom, she deserves to be able to live out her life in safety and sanity.  Good luck.
We were in the exact same situation a couple of years ago.   My mom had been diagnosed with dementia in 2017.  Her condition deteriorated rapidly and by the summer of 2020, her care was beyond what we could give her.   My dad was stressed out to the max due to lack of sleep (my mom had started wandering and barely slept for long periods) and depressed from watching his wife of almost 50 years fade before his eyes.  My mom entered a memory care facility in late 2020.  She was able to receive regular exercise,  great nutritious meals, met friends and kept her brain stimulated with crafts and social events.  My mom's condition moved very quickly from the first diagnoses and we lost her in Nov 2021. I rest assured we did the right thing and she was happy, well-cared for and above all loved.   The most important factor we considered was that if we did nothing, we would have absolutely with no question lost 2 parents.  I am so sorry for your situation.   I know your pain.
To me this is a no-brainer and your dad should definitely stay at the CLC.  He is lucky to have that option (most don’t, unless their families can afford $10K a month for a facility).  Your siblings would be very foolish and selfish to pass up the opportunity for your dad to have professional residential care.  It would also be incredibly cruel to just dump that responsibility on your mom, who is not a professional and not so young herself.  
Let any one of your siblings spend a few days as sole live-in caretaker to an abusive person with dementia and they’ll change their tune pretty quick.  It is a horrific situation, as I’m sure you know.
Can you and your brothers meet up to tour the CLC while your father is there? Maybe it will help them to see how things really are, rather than how they want them to be.
It may be harsh, but if your brothers aren’t willing to care for your dad I don’t see how they can have an opinion on your dad transitioning to assisted living. It’s a tough decision but it’s important to keep the health of both people in mind, or you risk losing them both. Props to you for being  involved and wanting what’s best for the health of your parents.
The facility takes over caregiving, and your mother can be a wife, kids can be kids, etc.  It takes BEING a caregiver out of the equation and is healthier for everyone.
My 59yo husband has cognitive problems, is bipolar and has short term Memory issues. He is being assessed for Parkinson’s. We are both retired and I care for him 24/7. In a controlled environment he is manageable, but I see where this is going in the future. My mother had Alzheimer’s.

Our middle daughter doesn’t live near us and doubts he is as bad as he is. 

Without my approval or input she & her husband bought him a plane ticket to visit his elderly mother & his brother last thanksgiving. I was not invited. Although they met him at the landing airport and shuttled him around, the Poor man was so disoriented. He lost his drivers license (his only TSA form of ID) the first day at the airport.  

I don’t talk to this middle daughter anymore. Her input is not helpful.  She really put him under a lot of stress and at risk.

I’m hopeful that this trip gave everyone on her end a reality check.
>I’m pretty sure I can convince her to transition him to permanent resident. How do I convince my siblings that this is okay. I have 3 brothers? I’m sure they would all hate me for pushing this and thinking I have an agenda. We all live out of state. So none of us can help my mom take care of my dad regularly.

Does your dad have a POA ? If he does it'll will make things easier.

Then get on the horn with your brothers for a ""we gotta help mom with dad"" mission. 

Lay out some basic facts, mom is elderly and now exhausted from taking care of Dad and everything that comes with that for the past two years and is getting worse, worried about mom's well being. Dad needs to go into a memory care home.  Best for mother and father. 

Anyone that resists - reinforce that mom has done enough so that person better rearrange and pack up their lives and move in with mom and dad in order to help out at the very least.

Best of luck.
The VA center accepted my dad as a resident. He had vascular dementia and I am SO grateful to have had their assistance. 

The reality is conditions decline and families need supports in place prior to the decline. OP time to think ahead and have medical and financial POA’s signed for both parents.  I signed a DNR for my dad who recently passed. It is a difficult road to travel but I am grateful to have helped both my parents as long as possible. The day did come when dad needed more care & the VA was tremendously helpful.",2022-03-28 18:18:04,WinterBourne25,tqkv15
Dementia,Chef of care home looking for advice,"Hey all,

Just joined this sub today because I am currently the chef of a care home specializing in individuals suffering from dementia. Most of our residents are in their 80s/90s, a couple in their hundreds even!, and a couple in early stages who are still in their 50s. Since starting work here I have unfortunately seen first hand what a horrible disease this is. One struggle we have is getting the residents to eat. I have researched and experimented at great lengths with different foods and techniques, and have seen some improvements. These changes include serving familiar meals that they grew up with, finger foods, small portions, courses served one by one, and lots of cueing and encouragement by the care staff. But there are still some residents who no longer recognize what food is, no longer receive hunger signals from their bodies, and basically live off of supplements (Boost, etc). I have watched these residents take food out of their mouths and look at it as if it's something foreign to them, then set it on a table and wander away. Meanwhile losing weight day after day. I have also seen residents who haven't eaten in days finally take a few bites of food, and how it lights up their faces and moods. Seeing things like that make my day.

I'm reaching in hopes that someone could offer me some new tips and tricks, are you a caregiver and have you found something that works for your loved one? Being a chef and having all the credentials and experience is one thing, but when it comes to this disease the best experience comes from those who deal with this disease regularly and first-hand.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions you may have!


Edit: wow thank you all so much for your kind words and seriously AMAZING tips for me! I'm going to go through all the comments and make a list and see what we can make happen at our community! I honestly was hesitant to post because I was afraid people would tell me to quit my job if I'm asking questions like how to get the residents to eat. It's been hard not to take it personally. So I really appreciate how kind you all have been especially 🙂🙂 you've given me several avenues of hope.","I just wanted to drop by and thank you for being wonderful. The chef/ cooks at my grandmothers home where she was very sick seemed to be the only ones who wanted to help her eat while the care workers treated her like a burden. Their care meant so so much to us as I’m sure your care means to your patients and families.
I noticed that my mom was obsessed with ""saving food for later"", she would only eat half of whatever I gave her, no matter what the portion size, and want to save the rest. She would never go back and eat the ""saved"" food. So I started giving her double  portions knowing she would only eat half.
Make it hot. Not just the food, but warm up the plates, too. Loss of smell and taste comes naturally with age, but they can still feel if something is warm.

Many of the older ladies I work with also believe temperature = quality. They're the generation of nice and hot, piping hot, hot and fresh, a hot home-cooked meal (and less charmingly, slaving away over a hot stove all day). 

Obviously make sure it's safe and don't do this for people who need to be fed. But I've seen wildly different reactions to the same recipe depending on the perceived temperature. Some of the ladies thought we got a new cook just because the plates/food came out hotter.
I wish I had some brilliant insights for you but we are struggling with it in my household, also. Fingerfoods and mirroring help to some extent but it looks like you have tried those. You have probably already tried asking their loved ones for their favorite foods. 

I wonder if you could look at it from a historical perspective. If a resident has regressed to a mental age of 3-5 years, what were popular foods when they were that age?

Other than that, I don't have much. My dad seems to love take out more than home cooking so we do take out a few nights a week. Bonus points if there are a zillion little condiment containers. I know that sounds counterintuitive, but his eyes positively light up. And if he eats Pico de Gallo by itself instead of as a condiment? Who cares, it's still healthy and delicious. 

Thank you for caring so much about your career! 🤗
Sweets!  They can't eat pastries and candy all the time, but it helps to offer real food that's either naturally sweet, like fruit, or tarted up with a sweet sauce or glaze.

I agree with those who said too much on the plate is overwhelming.  It's good to have space between the items, and to serve food that doesn't have to be cut to eat.

My mother-in-law can't abide seeds, pits, or crusts,  and will pick the ""seeds"" out of seedless watermelon.  I cut the crusts off sandwiches and cut the crust off bread before toasting it.
We haven't moved our loved one into a home just yet. But I know one we toured said they use bright plates to really contrast the food on it. Carbs and sweets seem to be favorites in our house as of late.
Thank you for caring so much! At my facility, we try to make food bite sized so it seems less intimidating, especially for those that develop anxiety over meal times. It’s like preparing a meal for toddlers in that aspect. We also use tons of butter, cream, and sugar to make meals more calorically dense and tasty.
""milkshakes"" -if you can make it look or taste like a chocolate milkshake they'll drink at least a few sips through a big straw.  Which I guess you're already doing with Boost, but, idk, as much protein, vitamins, and supplements as you can fit in there is all to the good.  They can't spit out the liquid as easily either.
My grandmother is in memory care at an assisted living facility. How nice of you to want to help this population of often forgotten folks. My grandmother has no trouble desiring to eat yet. I do know she always complains about the food at her facility because she doesn’t know what it is. They are always doing things like Mexican or Italian or Asian. My grandmother has lived in Tennessee all her life. She is 94 years old. She doesn’t know anything about those foods. She wants traditional southern meals like meatloaf or fried chicken with traditional simple sides. 
So I’d say, know your location and prepare foods typical of the area.
One thing I've noticed for all my residents: there is no one size fits all. Make sure the nursing staff knows about everything you can offer, and always respond open to suggestions. 

I've seen a myriad of variations between nurses, one will take 'blended food' to mean a plate of slop, while her coworker will put in the effort of reshaping the separate ingredients, so it will still look like a meal. 

Sweets go over well, some residents will literally grow fat. That's not harmless in their old age: it will make them harder to catch and help once they inevitably lose their balance. 

You already seem to be doing awesome things, they are lucky to have you!
First off, thank you for your compassion and care. The people in your care home are so lucky to have you! Unfortunately, everyone is different and so I don't know how much my experiences will help but here are some strategies I use with my grandmother. 

\- **Anything in liquid form**; smoothies are great and even easier to get them to drink if it's with a straw.

\- **Culturally significant/nostalgic food**; my grandmother is British so things like black pudding and bangers and mash are great, especially for meals that are a bit more social because they're also a great conversation topic.

\- **Visible snacks**; I keep glass cookie jars all over the place with crackers, cookies, and whatever other dry goods I have on hand so the visual stimuli will get her to eat. Similarly, having simple things like cut veggies, fruit, boiled eggs, or other finger food just out can tempt her too. Pairing these with notes that say 'help yourself' or something similar is a good idea so they know it's ok to take whatever they'd like.

\- **Food you can play with**; creating activities around food is great for when my grandmother hasn't eaten in a while or is being especially picky (I guess because the eating part is just a by-product). Two of my favorites were a checkers-like game we had with veggie nuggets and then a scavenger hunt we did together that involved things like ""go to the fridge and eat 3 cucumber slices"". Unfortunately, these only work for those capable of the games portion unless maybe you did it in groups so that those with more cognition can model to those with less.

\- **Sauces**; once you find one flavor that they're happy to eat then you can try making a similar tasting sauce and put it on/next to everything else. For my grandmother, if she won't eat things I want her to like veggies, all I have to do is cover them with cranberry sauce or melted cheese and down the hatch they go. Sometimes the combination is gross to me but it's one of the few things that can get her to eat greens so I don't question it.

\- **Quick mental tricks**; one of my most effective forms of encouragement to eat is also nice for bonding, you basically say that you only have something for them and they need to eat it quickly before anyone else sees or they'll want it to. It only really works for smaller, often hand-held snacks but could be a good way to get something into those who haven't eaten in a while as the ""quick"" factor often gets them to do it without thinking. Since you're working with quite a few people maybe you could enlist a daily ""taste-tester"" or something so you can twist this into something a bit more of a system.

\- **Sweet things**; probably why the cranberry sauce works so well honestly, she will go for anything sweet. Just be careful of their overall sugar intake because of the diabetes risk but if that's not a worry then why not let them indulge?

\- **Using the TV**; only really works because before my grandmother's dementia she had a habit of eating while watching tv, with people who don't have that ingrained habit it might only distract them.

\- **Children**; I worked at a preschool that was located in the basement of a care home and every few weeks we would do meals together. Both the children and the adults absolutely adored it and because children are often picky eaters too but know they need to eat certain foods they may not like, they were amazing at getting the adults to eat especially if they were paired with one adult and given it as a job. If at all possible, I really encourage you to reach out to local schools for field trips to your care home - it's such a wonderful pairing for both the adults and the children in so many ways.

\- **Finger food**; in general cutlery can be frustrating so finger food or even food that's cut up into bite-size pieces can remove that barrier.

Since food is such an individual thing I think writing down anything that someone really enjoys is important. It may seem repetitive to eat the same thing every day to us but luckily they aren't burdened by that notion! I hope some of these, or versions of them, work for you. And again, thank you so much for the effort you're putting into this.
My Dad will only eat what has been placed on his plate in front of him from the start (e.g. no other courses, will say no to second helpings). I find it's a delicate balance between ensuring that his plate is full and not being too overwhelming/overloaded.

You are a sweetheart for asking this. :)  


One of the pieces of advice that our hospice team gave us when my mom would need encouragement to eat was to use red tableware, cups, and cutlery. Not only do they provide a good visual contrast when compared to the food, but also evidently studies have shown that the color red can help to trigger hunger signals to the brain.  


Another thing is to find weighted utensils, which seem to help with coordination for those who get frustrated with using them. It helps them to better control their movements and be a little more successful with feeding themselves.  


Last, but not least, is that research has shown that the sense of taste gets muted during aging, especially with dementia. Sweet is one of the last flavors that is really evident. So while instinct may be to kind of avoid spices and sugar, these may actually be good additions. Even if you may feel the dish is flavorful, they may find it bland. And who wants a plate of bland food? :)
I don't have any advice as my partner's father is not yet at this stage, but I want to thank you for asking this question. You obviously care about your patients much more than just providing their food and that is so rare to find. 

On behalf of your patient's families, who may never know how much you put into their relative's care, thank you.
One thing I have done as a caregiver is the left hand trick where I slip food onto plates from the side they are the less aware of. 
Another fun thing I have found is when cooking and activities do something together (which might be hard in the pandemic) the residents “cook” with the cooking staff this can also encourage them to eat. Some people before their diagnosis might have loved to cook. Something else that I have seen success in is “international days” I think the nationalities were selected based on disclosure from the residents. So if a bunch of residents were from Germany we would have a big Germany day with German meals and activities. Something that connected the activities of the day and food. 
Sometimes when I have worked in places a question that is asked when residents move in is what is your favorite food? I think that is always important information to ask. 
Something else that is important to note is how does the food look? Sometimes people do not have teeth which means yes there food might have to be mashed up. If it is not presented in a way that is desirable it might not be appealing for someone to eat. You have to be creative. I provided care for a woman who did not remember she was missing teeth. 
If you know someone likes a certain food you might have to use that as a base for other foods. I know someone with dementia whose favorite food is cinnamon toast crunch. When they came out with cinnamon toast crunch pancakes we got those. Cinnamon Toast Crunch cake? In the shopping cart. The coffee creamer why not? Sometimes you have to use that common ground and work from there. 
I know that there are people who use boost and nutritional shakes in ice cream machines. That can also change things up. Sometimes you have to be creative and don’t be afraid to mix things up. 
I know before the pandemic in one nursing home that I was a cna at every once in awhile we would have an activity where hamburgers were delivered from a fast food restaurant. One time it was Chinese food this let us find out what kind of foods they liked. For me it let me find out that one of our residents really liked spicy food.
My husband has Lewy Body Dementia. He will eat turkey sandwiches, cheese pizza, cheeseburgers, and chicken nuggets. He’s like a 5 yo. 

We toured several memory care facilities and they had chefs and I thought oh no! He would never eat this fancy food. 

At his day center, they serve sandwiches. As others have mentioned, foods they can pick up are better.
Thank you for what you're doing.

My dad's care facility would often give him hot dogs (his favorite)- it helped for a while.
My Dad is in a memory care facility and his room is across from the kitchen/dining area. He naturally wakes up early and when he hears the staff he gets up and goes to the kitchen and they have a cup of coffee and a cookie or banana or apple waiting for him. It's very sweet of them. 

Thank you for caring, I know my Dad is in the safest place for him and knowing that the caregivers do nice, thoughtful things like snacks with his morning coffee is really heartwarming to me.
This is sweet of you to think of better ways for the dementia patients to eat. My mother is in an aged care facility and is constantly losing weight. She has been put in a protein milkshake diet as of lately. When they first informed me of her weight loss, I suggested that she be given foods that she was used to eating. The facility (and the community) has a large population of immigrants who have maintained their cultural diets. Letting the Asian patients eat rice in every meal won't hurt them, on the contrary. I understand that advertising ""home-cooked meals"" sound fab however, at the stage my mother is (she refuses to use dentures), five star home cooked meals seem a far off manner to get her nourished. As for suggestions, I agree to serving them finger foods, sweets and foods that have been part of their younger years/lifestyle/culture. Because it only boils down to one thing: get some nourishment into their system. Grateful for everything you do.
You are wonderful for asking this. 

One thing I'd mention that a lot of care homes overlook is that many elderly people don't have good contrast vision anymore. So like, mashed potatoes on a white plate doesn't look like food to them. But mashed potatoes on a red plate does. 

The smaller portions as ""courses"" definitely helps. 

Also many dementia patients lose all taste aside from sweet. So anything sweet you can offer - even like sugar free pudding - helps so much.
I am also a chef and just like we use a granita or sorbet to clear the palate between courses, something tart like lemon ice can kind of kickstart the salivary response and wake up the appetite.
My aunt was one of those Boost patients - almost catatonic, almost nonverbal, no interest in anything, especially food.  First of all, her doctor (whose wife specializes in geriatric patients) said to go ahead and let her have all the cake and ice cream she wanted and supplement with boost and a daily vitamin but to not insist on nutritious food like vegetables. I was horrified but it worked. I bought fancy, decorated 2 layer cakes from the grocery store, scones, and large muffins. Also bought ice cream, sherbet and ice cream bars, which she loved. Within days, her appetite had returned and she was eating more. Some days, she would have 4 large (huge!) slices of cake and ice cream. The idea of eating all that sugar and empty calories drove me batty but it worked. After eating more, she began talking and walking more and she improved. I assume she had more energy?



Then I started replacing a slice of cake with a milkshake. I began making milkshakes with fresh frozen fruit, vanilla ice cream, milk or some of the 30g vanilla protein shake, strawberry or peach yogurt, 1/2 scoop of protein powder and 1 scoop of collagen peptides containing amino acids (amino acids are the building blocks of nutrition) AND the secret ingredient, a generous splash of vanilla coffee creamer, to hide the taste of the protein powder. (A full scoop of protein powder changed the texture; even I didn’t like it.) After doing that, she has regained more interest in food. She still eats some cake but not every day; I make milkshakes for her usually 3-4 times/week. She eats a lot of yogurt now (as well as rice pudding and tapioca pudding - she seems to like the texture). And, thanks to a recommendation of a random woman walking by the house who saw her and recognized she had dementia, I now serve her a small amount of food on 12 inch plates because this woman claimed “they like to see space between their food; it makes them think they aren’t eating much.” It’s weird but the 12 inch plates are working so much better than the bread plates and dessert bowls I had been using. I knew enough to only give her small amounts of food but once I switched to the extra large plates, she actually ate more. I’ve also been making “sliders” instead of a regular sized hamburgers or other sandwiches and I cut any chicken, beef, fish into a smaller, mini sized portions before cooking it. You know those scoops you use to make cookies? She eats tuna and/or egg salad when I use that scoop to measure the tuna salad and place it on her 12” plate with 2-3 crackers. Personally, I think it looks lonely but she eats all of it, sometimes asks for more. I don’t understand why she eats more when I give her sliders instead of 1/2 a burger but she does. And, when I order takeout Chinese (her favorite), I only place 2-3 of the smallest pieces of chicken on her 12” plate with a very small portion of noodles/rice. She almost always wants more now. Before, she was only eating 1 piece of orange chickens and moving the chow mein noodles around her plate. I now buy mini-slider buns and mini tortillas (street taco size). When I first began serving her grapes again, I only gave her 4 grapes and she always asked for more. I serve her 1 sliced strawberry. I ordered one of those mini-waffle makers. She loved the blueberry waffle I made her (She even commented on how cute it was) and wanted more. Now, she wants 4 mini-blueberry waffles for breakfast almost every day (I add collagen peptides and a full egg). When she wants cereal, I serve a small amount in a larger serving bowl. She eats it all and sometimes wants more. I use a 3-4 inch cookie cutter and cut a circle from 2 slices of bread to make her sandwiches or pbj’s - and I cut them in half when I serve them. I know none of this makes sense and is the opposite of what I was doing, but it’s been working so I thought I’d share. She’s eating more, she is more talkative and can have conversations most days, she goes for walks outside and she has a basic knowledge there’s a war in Ukraine (current events) which she remembers from day to day. Oh, and most days, she can once again write her name and make a small list of 2-3 things she wants from the grocery store. I never really connected dementia with calories consumed before but there does seem to be a correlation for her.
Love this ask, and I can't stop upvoting everyone commenting too! 
One idea that I had is to see what other resources and professionals your facility employs, and organize a meeting with them. A Speech Language Pathologist and an Occupational Therapist will have some good input and may even have more detailed personal information about specific residents that could really help. Collaborative problem solving can bring a lot to the table! (Sorry, pun intended)",2022-03-28 13:02:36,mossyzombie2021,tqdy8w
Dementia,Visiting Family Member with Dementia - Advice,For two weeks we have a family member with dementia visiting. Being outside of their normal routine will be challenging. Any advice for things we can do to help this person during the stay? Thank you!,"I bought a new house and wanted my parents to come and see it. I had them visit for two weeks, and it felt like a mistake. My dad was constantly lost the whole 2 weeks. I kept running into him in my closet every morning at 7am. Lol. He would be lost telling me that he was looking for the workout room, which is upstairs on the opposite side of the house. Anyway, I’m glad they got to see the house, but I’m sure he won’t remember it. I feel bad for taking away all his familiarity for 2 weeks. He didn’t even realize he was in another state. He required constant supervision.
I just started working in a memory care facility, about a week ago, so I don’t have a lot of experience but I would try to replicate their current routine as much as possible. Like, if they wake up at a certain time where they currently live, wake them up and get them dressed and clean just like they usually do. Find out what activities they like at home and if they have a favorite blanket or pillow make sure they have it with them. Find out what foods they like and how frequently they eat; at my facility we encourage a lot of healthy snacks because meal times don’t always go smoothly and we want them hydrated and nourished. So basically, talk to your relatives caretakers and prepare ahead to copy what works at home! Good luck, I hope you have help because it really can be exhausting caring for them but it’s also extremely rewarding. I’m sure there’s better tips but I hope this helps!
Depending on their level it can also be very disorienting. Talk about where they are, who they are seeing, etc. When we took my grandma for one of her last trips to visit family we talked a lot about where she was. If it is a place they have visited a lot, share memories. If it is new, try to incorporate it with old memories. ""This is where your (insert family member) moved to after college."" Or whatever fits. 

In our case she remembers how she was raised by her grandparents and the animals/carpentry. So we can tie a lot of conversations around animals and building things. 

It is kind of like having a toddler in some ways. They may not be able to express that they are tired, hungry, thirsty, or uncomfortable. Be prepared to try to read body language cues and offer snacks, drinks, a quiet place to rest.
Ice cream always works. Seriously, and depending on where they're at, take them a treat and make it fun. But like the others said, read their clues. If cakes/ice cream isn't appropriate then ignore me. I just think we forget that visits are supposed to be enjoyed.

My dad had dementia. He was still living alone with lots of visits. My daughter bought a new house and wanted to have her grandad visit. She grew up in the house with my siblings, my son and a neice. He helped her thru college, drove her to graduate school in Pennsylvania, walked her down the aisle and paid for her reception. My sister bought him all new clothes and undies, he had already bought a new suit( he just wanted one) and my son n love drove 4 hours to pick them up and then drove back. That was Wednesday, Thursday they went to church, had dinner. Friday at 9pm they were in the driveway. He wanted to “go home” right now. He didn’t remember the trip, thought he had taken a nap. Other than a hospital stay, he never stayed away from home again. He had to be at home  we rotated in snd out every 4-5 days to take care of him until he died at home on hospice.",2022-03-28 09:54:19,BayRunner,tq9tqe
Dementia,my 96 year old mom and new word salad,"My mom has had a series of strokes over the years but has been able to care for herself, with help from me, for the last five years. She lives with me. Yesterday, she stopped making sense altogether. She is being assesed for hospice this week but I don't think she will be accepted, which is fine. I ruled out UTI delerium with antiobiotics and rehyrdation and honestly she does seem a little better but the crazy words and a few strange actions lead me to believe she's had another stroke. I guess I am attempting to find out how this will play out. A nursing home will terrify her so that's not an option and I can pretty much lift her. She is losing weight even though she's hungry BUT her overall weakness since yesterday is really pronounced. She slept all day yesterday. I am afraid of a vegetative state and my incapacity to know what to do. Thanks","Firstly, she’s very lucky to have you. 
Regarding her weight, it’s normal for someone in her situation to be losing weight rapidly. Her brain is working overtime these days and it’s burning up heaps of fuel, so if you can add in some extra cals into her diet to prevent her from becoming too boney this with provide her with some extra padding when she falls.
Might I suggest keeping a bit of a diary going as well? It’s a good way to keep tract of dates if you’re observing new behaviours, or if there’s an incident like a fall.
yes her doctor has suggested doing a diary. Getting her to walk is difficult because she tires so easily. I think whatever happened happened at a restaurant and she couldn’t quite make it out I was quite literally holding her up while she was holding onto her walker. But I agree that she cannot just be left to not thrive. The day will come soon or she will only use the wheelchair, which we have. Now I have to think about a ramp… I just made her lunch and added a few hundred calories and she flinched… She was always little and a little vain… Still!
I’m sure she does, but something is better than nothing. The simple act of standing up, having a little stretch and looking at the garden is awesome for her too.
She might still know what she’s trying to say. Can she draw a picture of what she wants or point to a picture? Maybe point to yes or no. Our brains have pretty specific areas for language so the other stuff could still be functioning.
My aunt was losing weight, became weak and basically stopped talking but she’s always loved sweets. Her doctor said she could have all the cake and ice cream she wanted. Seriously. All she wanted, plus a vitamin and Boost. So I started buying fancy 2-layer cakes at the grocery store and ice cream. At first, the woman who had been eating next to nothing, asked for very large pieces of cake, followed by ice cream. This went on for several weeks. She gained weight, started talking and walking more. Then, I added milkshakes (fresh frozen fruit, ice cream, yogurt, a splash of vanilla protein shake or 1/2 scoop of protein powder, a scoop of collagen proteins (amino acids) and a nice splash of vanilla coffee creamer) and fresh fruit. She loves them. I started serving her 4 grapes or 1 sliced strawberry. I bought a mini-waffle maker. Only gave her one the first day, sprinkled powdered sugar on it (she loved it). She now eats 4 mini blueberry waffles for breakfast almost every day. I make slider-sized hamburgers or sandwiches and serve them on a 12-13” plate. I buy slider buns and street taco size tortillas. She wasn’t eating as much when I served her food on smaller bread plates or dessert bowls but she eats more on her larger than normal dinner plates. It looks funny on the big plate; the food looks lonely but she eats more when I use the 12” plates.She’s talking more, walking and actually following the plots on tv shows. I never connected dementia with calories consumed before but, for her, there appears to be a correlation.",2022-03-28 09:18:45,colcrea52,tq94kj
Dementia,Please help/give me advice,"Hi everyone i’m a 18 year old living with my nan and my dad. My dad has dementia, i’m not sure what kind but it’s in his frontal lobe and he’s only 52. The doctors think he got it from working in a smelter breathing in bauxite for 20 odd years.

It’s got to the stage where he sometimes forgets who i am or who nan is. He has these convulsions where he is addicted to icy poles (frozen and unfrozen) and he often asks me where does he live while he’s sitting on the couch to which I reply “You live here” and he just doesn’t believe it.

He doesn’t remember where his bedroom is and he refuses to leave the house and when he does he gets immediately scared and wants to go home and always asks me do you know where i live i want to go home and that kind of thing.

It’s so scary seeing him like this it was only 2 years ago where my family was all together and happy and then this tore everything apart, mum divorced dad because she didn’t know what was going on so we moved in with nan and now me and her look after him. It’s getting really hard.

Any advice would be appreciated so so much, we plan on getting someone to come and make sure he showers because he won’t do it. Is there anyway to make him feel more comfortable leaving the house and just being at home? I bring the dog in the car with us and that helps a little but he still gets scared and confused… distractions can only help so much. 

If anyone has been in a similar situation especially at my young age please let me know how you dealt with it. It was manageable before he forgot who i was  for the first time and now it feels like i’ve lost him and it’s tearing me apart :( 

Thank you 🙏🏼","First of all, you're doing the right thing getting help to come in. Caregivers need breaks, so make sure you and your nan take some time for yourselves. Even an hour here and there will help a lot.

Your dad likely is thinking he's much younger and you weren't born yet and your nan was much younger. It won't help to try to reorient him to reality because now his reality isn't the same as yours and he won't understand and will react just like he has been. 

There's a lady on YouTube named Teepa Snow who is a dementia specialist. Her videos helped me and my family so much when my mom was going through dementia. If you and your nan have some time to watch them, together or apart, you can probably pick up a lot of knowledge on the disease and how to handle different problems. Many nursing homes use her videos as part of their training.


I'm so sorry your dad is going through this at such a young age and that you're having to deal with it when you're so young. You're a good person for helping take care of him. 


Feel free to come back here if her videos are unclear or you still have questions or just need to vent. This is a wonderful resource for support and I wish I'd found it sooner.
Props to you for taking an active role in caring for your dad. Dementia is hardest on the caregivers, so definitely get expert help if you can. We almost lost my dad as a result of him caring for my mom and basically exhausting himself. 

Doctors may be able to prescribe medicines to calm your dad. It’s worth talking to an expert.

Good luck!
Hi, I’m sorry I don’t have any advice but I am going through the same thing, my dad had a stroke in 2018 then couple months later signs of dementia began to show, I was only 16 at the time. I haven’t managed to cope with it either, every time his dementia gets worse it just feels like I’m losing him all over again ):
Waa typhooncheki that's really tough, I feel for you!   I'm much older so, no advice for folk your age, and I'm even down in Australia, far from your area.    But everywhere in the world you'll find a dementia .org &/ alzheimers .org.  They are experts very experienced in memory-loss conditions, have tons of resources, information, telephone helplines, counselling, advice, helpsheets, etc etc for people with memory-loss & their family / carers / friends.   Look up who/where are your area-appropriate outfits, contact them.  Loads of information on-line too.  I hope & wish you & yr gran find lot of assistance to help you navigate & find the best way for your dad's care to progress, for you all.  take care of yourself and your gran!  best of luck!
So sorry for what you are going through. You are incredibly strong and brave for doing this.

I found that routines help a lot with getting my granddad comfortable. Try to incorporate a lot of routines, structure your and his day, so he can adapt to them, which will ultimately make him feel more secure. Like, getting up and then sit down for breakfast, after that a shower and getting dressed - always do things in the same order and the same spot. 

Also make your Home very bright and avoid dim lights as darkness and shadows can confuse and frighten people with dementia - this is why they behave most erratic at sundown (hence why it’s called sundowning). 

Speak in easy understandable sentences, avoid complexity (I.e I am going to bathe you now and maybe we will wash your hair and after that you may watch some tv - better: you are taking a bath. I help. - discuss things as they happen and avoid speaking of the future). 

I think it’s great that you are getting help, especially with his hygiene. This can be very upsetting and can cause even more stress. Try to avoid stress for the both of you.
I’m home nurse here with lots of experience working with people like you and your Dad. Wow, it doesnt get much tougher than this. 

Not only is your Dad so young, but he’s also losing his independence much faster than others. If he has other health issues like diabetes, lung issues, or problems with his blood circulation and heart, these will sadly  make his dementia symptoms worse.

It takes a team of people to care for someone in your Dad’s situation, and if you can’t afford this then it’s essential to organise respite for yourself and nan.
Ouch. I am so sorry you are having to go through this.

The very first thing you need to do is get a medical diagnosis of his condition. Make an appointment with his doctor, go with him, and the doctor will refer you to a specialist. That specialist will identify the type of dementia your father is experiencing, and give you the official diagnosis.

At that point, many different options open up for you. Without a diagnosis, nobody can do anything to help, really. Once you get the diagnosis, his healthcare plan, long term insurance, and even his union (if he is in one) can help you with the dementia journey.

The thing you need to understand is that nobody gets better from this. Dementia is degenerative, and there is no cure. There will be times when he is more present/aware, and times when he is worse, but he will only degrade until he passes.

So your job throughout this journey will be to assess on a daily basis what he is capable of TODAY, and engage him with those activities he can do. That will change every day. You can't make plans because the future is not something he can cognitively plan for... he is living right now, in this minute, every minute of the day. So all you can do is help make each minute as good and easy as possible, until he passes.

This is going to be very hard. You should find a local group you can meet with regularly for support. Learning from others and being able to talk honestly with others about your life and your father's journey is going to be absolutely critical to your mental well-being.

I'm so sorry you are going through this. My best wishes for you and your family.
He might be thinking back to his childhood home as home. Unless that’s where your nan still lives. You could try “we’ll go home soon” instead of “this is home”.  Try to have familiar sounds (music or tv shows he likes) and smells around. Maybe when you are out he can bring a comfort item with him. Maybe a literal security blanket or some other piece of home he can carry with him.
Your story really resonates with me. I'm 17 and my mom who's barely 50 had already been dealing with this for 5 years. It's tough, especially during the beginning stages cause it could seem like your losing a parent. I want you to know that you are doing your best and your dad would be so proud. The only advice I can give is to spend as much time with him and talk about memories or play a few songs/shows he loved. I cant go back but please dont let this drive a wedge between you and your mom, my dad and I dont have the best relationship and it gets lonely at times, just take care of yourself and if you become a main caretaker, know that your not alone. The best thing for you right now is to have a good support system :]

I wish you and your family the best.",2022-03-28 05:53:11,tyfooncheki,tq5rbw
Dementia,Creative ideas to enhance mums (and her dementia care companions) daily lives,"What creative ideas have you seen or done that would be enjoyable/fun/mentally stimulating to residents in dementia care home ?

Reading stories, puzzles, outings,  music,  dancing ... but what else ?

Open slather, throw in whatever comes to mind .. 😀



Background
-------------------
Mum transitioned to full time dementia rest home care today.  I see myself spending a substantial amount of time there.  While there is time for quality one on one, it appears there is alot of time among and with other residents.  I'm looking to bring fresh ideas and contribute to the wider community as well as my mum .","If she can walk, just going for a walk is the best we've found. If she can't walk, push her in a chair. After almost 4 years of helping my wife with care for her mother, it has amazed me how someone who can't remember they just ate breakfast can complain of ""repeatedly"" having to do the things you mention. I think the most important thing is ""no fail"" activities, which gets really hard when even completing a sentence is almost impossible.
Oh gosh, I visit my mom every day for an hour or two. I think the most important thing is to just be there.  Whatever you do will depend on where you mom is at. Anyway, here goes:

* I sit by her. Side-by-side on the sofa hip to hip. Human touch .
* We do simple 12-34 piece puzzles for dementia patients.
* Watch TV
* Play a form of Mexican dominoes.  Usually involves me pointing out what pieces she could play and her seeing if she has any in her hand.
* We color simple outline drawings of flowers with colored pencils. Sometimes she colors them, sometimes I do, sometimes we both do. Or I finish it up when she gets tired of it.
* We 'read' the national enquirer together for fun. 
* If she's interested in something we google pictures of it.  The other day she asked what was on her pants (summer pants w/ sea horses) and we ended up looking at hundreds of sea horse pictures.
* I take her for little walks. This is huge - staff doesn't have time to spot her. It's so helpful too, she has improved so much.
* Once a week a hairdresser comes in and does her hair.  lol, then staff sometimes forgets and showers her hair the next day. Oh well, she enjoys the hairdresser.
* I do her fingernails every other week. She removes the polish, I trim and paint.
* I do little yard work chores at the home. Sometimes she helps. She helped cut small branches to put in the garbage can the other week.
* We pick flower buds, or fruit, or flowers from the yard.
* Look at photo albums.  Easy to send pictures from my phone to the drug store and they put in a little album.
* I've bought pretty beads with large holes and we string them onto elastic for bracelets.  Usually they would disappear overnight but she's kept the last two for a while now.  Really, it's just something to do.
* At xmas I bought felt ornament kits for kids that you sew together with a big plastic needle and yarn.  I'd do one hole, she would do the next.  Then you stuff them.
* I give her snacks that she hides and eats before dinner ;)

Basically, I just try to do something with her. I love the other gals at her home and they are fun but I do try and keep focus on my mom. Mom can't really communicate (every sentence dissolves into a word salad) so I know her time with me is the only time someone really focuses on her.",2022-03-28 04:34:35,Rob_CHCH,tq4q29
Dementia,Mom tried to jump off our apartment building again,"It is very concerning because we are located along the road and the neighbors have seen this morning's situation. I do not mind whatever thought they have on what is happening in our household. I cannot control what they think about us. But it is very disturbing already, she keeps on having tantrums then keeps on saying she wants to die and will attempt to jump off the balcony. We are on the 2nd floor so basically we are very visible to all those down the ground floor and of course the other building apartments. We cannot really explain to each one of them that mom has dementia. But it's already being kind of traumatic for me and my sister already. Because whenever we get out of the apartment, a lot of judging eyes are already on us. As if we did something wrong. I think, that is also the reason why we mostly order out rather than go out. It is really embarrassing. Sometimes, I already expect that one of these days, a social worker will come and visit just to check on us and my mom. Because I think the neighbors are already being concerned that she is being abused, when we never even laid hands on her. But the way she cries and always shouts at us, will probably make them think that way. Sometimes, I already feel terrible for hating my mom for the way she is. But now I even feel more terrible because of hating my mom even more because of the image that she wants our neighbors to perceive about us. I wish there could be centers here in the Philippines that are free who can take care of her instead of us. I know our culture does not really support that kind of idea and it is an unconventional way to treat your relative moreso your parents. But, now I understand why western people do it. Because I think, it hinders your own life by dedicating it solely to taking care of them for years, until you have no years to live for yourself. It is just hard. I am crying right now as I am typing because I feel worse for feeling this way. But, how can one be so calm in situations like this? I feel like my work is being hindered because of what she is doing to us everyday. Today, while trying to calm her down, I took the blows, she slapped me and punched me so hard because for some reason she is very mad, and wanted to die. She wanted me to open the door to the balcony so she can jump off it. I've never felt so embarrassed of her. Our neighbors' thoughts doesn't matter but everytime she does it we can't help but feel embarrassed.

Whenever she wishes that she would die. At the back of my mind, because I am very tired, I couldn't help but wish the same too. Because I am very tired of this everyday. The doctor already gave her additional medicines to calm her and everything but it only gave us additional expenses. Sometimes, I really pray that God would really help us in helping her serve her purpose, if she still has some left. If she already served it, I wish that God would let her go peacefully, no crying, no pain, or anything. Because as my hate grows for her, my love is the opposite. Right now, I feel like I am only taking of her because I am obligated to. I wanted to give back to her as what the elders usually say, but does giving back means giving my own life as well? Was this her plan all along? To bring us to the world and let us suffer? I know that we are living to suffer, but is suffering supposed to be this consistent and continuous?

Sometimes, it is very hard to appreciate things that you have when all the worst things just keep on being highlighted along the way.

Sometimes, I feel like if this keeps on going, I will be the one to let go first. I feel like every hate I feel lowers down my own life expectancy. I'd rather hurt myself, I'd rather die than hurt my mom that I love the most, even if she is no longer lovable. I just pray that I still have the courage to go on. Because sometimes being the eldest person of the house, I have to keep in a lot of emotions just to keep everyone stronger. Cause when I falter, I fear that we will all breakdown into pieces. I'm trying so hard to keep myself sane.","Thank you for writing all this for me. It's about the same for me and my wife. We've been doing it almost 4 years now. I sometimes wonder if other people have done this for so long? We've only had 1 day away from Ma during this time. We were taking her to a day care once a week until Ma started refusing to go. How someone can remember going to day care once a week when they can't remember they just ate a meal, is amazing.

I wish I had an answer, but just reading your experience helps me knowing others are trying to get through this too. Hopefully, you knowing you're not alone in this helps you. You've helped me...",2022-03-27 23:07:49,gracefulmademoiselle,tpzud6
Dementia,My mom needs her life back,"My mom has been taking care of my grandma who living with us and is suffering from Parkinson’s and early stages of dementia. She can’t work and hardly has any free time anymore and always tells me how exhausted she is from everything that comes with caring for her. We can’t afford a full or part time caregiver, and I’ve heard moving someone with dementia into a nursing home causes them to decline even faster. What other options are there for us? My grandma is only getting worse and it’s taking a huge toll on my mom. How can my mom get her life back and my grandma get affordable care at the same time? My grandma only has Medicare and we don’t have a lot of savings. Any information, recommendations, and well wishes are very appreciated!","For what it's worth, when my grandmother transitioned into memory care, her quality of life improved immensely. She had a care team 24/7, and other residents to socialize with. I believe memory care has lengthened her life due to the quality of care.

Having said that, there are other options. What about Adult Daycares in your area? This way, mom can get a break during the day, and only needs to do care in the evenings and night. Or you can hire a part-time caregiver to watch at night + daycare, so mom would only need to care in the evenings.

You mention grandma is on Medicare -- what has DSHS said about your options for subsidized caregiving? Might be worth reaching out to them and asking.

Hang in there...it's good that you're looking for reprieve for your mom now. My dad took care of my grandmother for 15 years, and he finally had to stop because he had a heart attack. Now is the time to arrange for the long-term.
If there a senior center in your area?  If there is they often have adult day care programs and are also a good place to get information on what would kind of care is available in your area.  Also, assisted living can be a good thing as they provide meals and activities for your loved one.  If you all have not been in touch with an elder attorney I suggest you get your Mom to make an appointment, they can often assist in getting applications for Medicaid completed so there will be funding for transitioning to an assisted living facility.  Good luck.",2022-03-27 23:04:12,tlaff45,tpzs6u
Dementia,How does Power of Attorney work in real life,"So my parents are making poorer decisions: Way overspending $2000 on roof work without getting a second bid, choosing not to go to the hospital. Previously my wife's father overpaid the phone bill by $25,000!

We want to avoid these problems. My parents have a lawyer as the POA, and not myself or my sister, the only siblings.

So what do we do when they sign a contract for a $10,000 cat patio? or a new car? Or are thinking about doing it and getting bids?

&#x200B;

EDIT: What I'm getting at, is if I think they are making wrong decisions, do I just go to the lawyer with evidence and tell him? Repeatedly until he takes action?","The attorney is the POA? Good luck. I would suggest hiring an attorney and seeking guardianship.. likely the lawyer has no clue.
>a $10,000 cat patio

Take pics!  I bet it'll be the best catio ever.

But really, I'd say a lot depends on the situation.  Are you worried about them running themselves out of money and being homeless on the street, or that they won't have money for assisted living or do they have plenty of money and you're more worried about an inheritance?  Do both of them have dementia at the same time, is there a diagnosis?   (Or all three, with your wife's father?)  Or are they simply not prioritizing what you think they should be?  How is your relationship with them, is there a reason they've chosen a lawyer and not a child as POA?  Would you be comfortable discussing that with them?
Get a durable POA with your name on it - from a different attorney.
Do you and the sibling know why they made the attorney the POA? That’s never a good situation. I’d contact your local bar association and a lawyer.
I’m currently going through this with my mom and my experience is that there’s absolutely nothing I can do. A 77 year old, with obvious cognitive impairment who refuses to even tell me who her doctor is let alone go see them for testing can get married to someone she just met, move out of her retirement community, buy a million dollar house, a new car, and give all her financial information and passwords to her brand new step son and there’s not a damn thing I can do about it! Her lawyer won’t even talk to me. The more express my concerns, the more I become an enemy in my mom’s eyes. It’s beyond disturbing.
Here's the problem, I have financial as well as health POA for my husband but if he made some sort of agreement or spent money I didn't know about there is little I can do.  A financial POA does not give you carte blanche over their finances. You stand in their shoes and can sign for them but I think they can still make decisions without you.  You need a new elder attorney and perhaps file for a guardianship which would give you total control over their finances.
From my experience a power of attorney comes into effect when the person can no longer make ""safe"" decisions. This was determined basically by having a gerontological assessment and a local test. The person's family Dr. will the draft a letter saying that person is not capable of making decisions based on medical reasons. Now there are two POA forms - financial and health. Depending on who you are dealing with they may want to copy the original POA, take a copy, or just go by your word. Banks want copies, health care teams can ""see"" it in their files, service providers (cell phone ex) are sometimes fine when you explain the situation. 

One big thing is the determination of what's a problem and what might be eccentric actions. Basically if somebody wants to spend their money on stupid stuff they pretty much are allowed to. 

If someone can go to church and give $25000 to live with sky daddy in the future and someone else wants to build a $25000 cat house...I really don't see the difference in mental capacity
There's no legal recourse for people who just want to waste money. You cannot stop your parents from spending money even if their only reason for spending it is because they want to. It's their money.

What you can do is find out if there is any fraud in play, which by your descriptions, it doesn't sound like there is.

My advice: Change your relationship with them. Talk to them about what they are spending money on, not that they are spending money.

Document these conversations. If you can show you start to influence and control the spending, then you can become a guardian, which can supercede the poa, depending what state.",2022-03-27 21:53:55,temp-2022,tpyjpq

Dementia,Does high cholesterol have a correlation towards dementia,"I came across something a few weeks ago that suggested to reduce cholesterol levels or some marker in the blood that begins with T and keep it within range in your 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s to reduce your chances of developing dementia and Alzheimer's. 

I'm in the early days of thinking my mom might have dementia. It isn't showing up as a typical forgetfulness.  Is showing up in mood swings and crazy ranting that doesn't make much sense.  It's not every day.  I was getting ready for work this morning and she had all the laundry appliances running on high even though we have some hight energy costs looming and I made a suggestion to turn of the laundry appliances because the clothes must be Dr by now.  The clothes were already air dried but she had them in the tumble dryer for longer. She was using the tumble dryer without a care in the world towards the rising energy costs.  Then she started shouting at me and it was just crazy making.  All while I was trying to get ready for work. 

I recently found out that her doctor is concerned about her blood results that showed high cholesterol. She said this. She said she refused medicine and she wants to control it through the diet and she wants me to find out how on Google. 

Sometimes I question my own judgement and now I am thinking if dementia is setting in but we don't know it yet.","Hi! Sorry I don't have any research to pull up or anything but my dad went to a neurologist a couple of months ago and he had high cholesterol and low vitamin B12 levels, and she emphasized to us that it was important to change his diet and keep up with his cholesterol meds (+ raise his B12 levels) because it could affect his dementia. That's just from what I remember, though!!
There is evidence that dementias are possibly related to decreased blood flow to the brain. Decreased blood flow can be caused by high cholesterol and poor arterial health. This is certainly the case with vascular dementia, but may also be the culprit with other forms of dementia. I recommend the website nutritionfacts.org. You can search for topics and watch short videos that complete and cite research into those topics. 

Lowering cholesterol is always a good idea. Diet is the preferred way to lower it, but medicine can do it faster and more reliably. Cholesterol is in our bodies via two routes—what we eat and what our bodies produce. Some of us, no matter what we eat, just produce too much cholesterol. For those people, medicines are often a necessity to bring those levels down. For those who consume too much cholesterol because of diet, most aren’t willing/able to stick to a diet that would take care of the problem. That’s a shame, really.
Vascular dementia is tied to high blood pressure and cholesterol. I’ve been looking into this extensively with my own mother and her episodes. She has similar behavior issues - acting out, yelling, delusions, lying. Waiting on a diagnosis for her mental issues.
Hello. My concern over the doctors question is the doctors typically recommend a statin to lower high cholesterol versus lifestyle changes and if you check the side effects of statins they include dementia.

Dementia,Does dementia always show up as forgetfulness?,"I think my mom have have the onset of dementia but it's not showing as forgetfulness.  
She has some angry outbursts ranting at me and often with things that don't make any sense.  It's hard to describe. 
I think maybe dementia is setting in but it's not showing up as forgetfulness.  I think another aspect of it is that she wants to have as much control over everything as possible.","Losing the ability to emotionally regulate yourself is definitely a symptom of dementia. 

If the control issue is also a change in her behaviour then I would definitely suggest a doctor's visit is needed, this does not guarantee that she has dementia but you do need to rule it in or out.
No, it can present as cognitive changes and even a personality shift.
When I look back, it had been creeping up on my mom for about 3 years before the first significant signs in 2020. And none of the red flags were memory related. Much of the trouble for her surrounded decision making and challenges in understanding information. 

My mom is currently at a mid-stage, and it's only now where memory seems to be a growing factor. Short-term memory has been getting worse for a while but long term is now starting to have larger holes.
I think they notice it before anyone else and I would assume it to be frustrating. But then again, they also seem to rewrite ST memories too.  Thinking they did something that they didn’t, or thinking they asked someone to do something, I can see that being aggravating.
Aggressive and impatient behaviour are definitely big red flags.",2022-03-27 10:37:19,summerrosegarden,tpl8kv
Dementia,"My grandmother forgot I transitioned, and I don't mind","Sorry if I'm just clogging this place up, I have a lot on my mind after I visited my grandmother yesterday and I need to get some of it out somewhere.
I'm twenty years old and trans FTM. I've been out for around 6 years now. As my grandmothers dementia progressed, I knew that one day she would forget about my transition. I also knew that it wouldn't be personal if she did forget. It's just how dementia is. 
Even though I'd told her it's okay if she slips up, and I don't mind what she says or whether she calls me her granddaughter or grandson, she still did her best. 
In January I visited her, and I was unsure if she remembered me due to her seemingly avoiding talking too much to me. Afterwards my dad spoke to her and asked her upfront if she knew who I was. She apologised to him, saying of course she knew who I was, she just couldn't remember my gender and didn't want to upset me by making a mistake. It was sweet, but also sad. And I felt really bad about it, too. Despite her mind working against her, her top priority was my comfort. I visited her again two weeks ago and this continued.
Then yesterday, me and my dad went to visit her in her new care home. She couldn't tell who I was, and she asked me to take my mask off, which I did (with staff approval.) Upon seeing my face, she immediately grabbed me and pulled me into the tightest hug a frail 83 year old could possibly give, repeating things such as ""my beautiful granddaughter"", telling me how much of a pretty woman I was, and talking about how she'd been waiting for me to visit her for so long. She probably got a lot of confused looks from other residents and maybe even staff, but I didn't care. And I didn't care that she forgot, either. I always told her it was okay if she did. 
It's a sign that her memory is still obviously deteriorating, but really, that's to be expected. She has two types of dementia at once (dual dementia) so sadly, things are probably going to decline quickly. But right now, I'm just glad she doesn't have to worry about ""slipping up"" anymore.","Here’s the one thing to hold onto. She might have forgotten a lot but she remembered that she loves you! That’s everything.
You’re not clogging anything up! These things hurt. I’m happy for her and you that you can share some time together. My Mom forgets my name sometimes. She has asked me if I was ‘hers’. Broke my heart for sure. Now I focus on if she likes me. As long as I’m someone who lights up her face I’m okay with it. It took me a long time to get there. Wishing you peace, comfort, and quality time with your grandma! Hugs!
Don't feel bad. The fact she just moved places always breaks havoc on their brains. I recently say goodbye to my 92 yr grandma (won't won't cry),so cherish these moments, they are priceless.
I'm also trans and this really hit me. I'm so glad you have such an obviously kind and loving grandma. She clearly loves you so much and that's so wonderful. Bless you both.
This is so sweet. I think this is a gift, and a sign that under the confusion and forgetting, part of her still loves the you who you grew up as, and loves the you who you grew up to be. ❤️
Thank you for sharing your story. I’m having a tough day as a caregiver and your story gave me a moment of comfort.
You're a wonderful man, and a great person. I'm glad you can see that this disease can make people forget things they never thought they'd forget. Hugs.
Well it's nice of you not to be offended by your grandmothers mis-gendering of you due to her cognitive decline.
I just got off the phone with my dad, he didn't remember who I was, so yeah, maybe you shouldn't mind if your grandma forgets which parts you have. Literally the last fucking thing you should concern yourself with.",2022-03-27 10:13:56,kandykains,tpkstz
Dementia,"""Prevent"" someone from getting up on their own","We're facing the following problem.
My mother is recovering from a thigh fracture right now, as she cannot reliably walk on her own.

She ist sitting most of the time in a chair, she cannot get out of bed.

As the pain lessened, she started to walk on her own again. 
She fell, nothing happened. In the last year she fell about six times, nothing happened, except for bruises. The fall before that she broke her pelvis.

It's only a few meters, but enough to ruin everything. In the moment, sometimes the day or the following days she's aware that she cannot and shouldn't walk alone. ""Discussing"" this issue, she agrees that she shouldn't do it. If she does it, she mostly cannot tell why she did it.

Sometimes it's about getting a jacket or going to another room.
An emergency button, to accommodate her desire to walk is not feasible, as she's using it all the time i.e. to talk to someone in the middle of the night.

We had a webcam installed to monitor her, but this is not feasible, as one cannot monitor her 100% and the stress and pressure is unbearable. Besides there is a delay and she also fell if one saw her getting up.

We haven't tried a pressure mattress yet and reading what I wrote may be the best answer for a timely response to an incident that already happened.

Fixating her in the chair (no idea how to do this) sounds wrong and it's not clear if this is legally possible. On the other hand, at this moment, it feels like the only viable option, to prevent involuntary self-harm and for us to continue the home care.

Am I missing something? Has anybody faced a comparable situation and what was your conclusion or solution?","The only thing I can think of is when I tore my ACL I had to wear this type of fixed leg brace that kept one leg straight. While I could walk it was difficult.  I don't know if putting one of those on her, would remind her that she needs help moving around and wouldn't attempt to do it on her own ?
My first thought is a bed alarm - there are a few different types, including a pressure pad on the mattress. Bedrails could also buy some time, but could add even more risk if she is determined and mobile enough to climb over it.
My great aunt is at risk of falling because of poor balance and arthritis. In the facility she is in, they had a wheelchair with a belt at the waist. It was effective at not allowing her to get up, but it made her VERY anxious. At our request they try to mostly not put the belt on her and to instead sit her on her chair that has a pressure mat. If she gets up, it will immediately beep in the room and in the nurses station. It’s not the best when she is agitated and get up for nothing, but it worked so far in preventing falls. She also have one in the bed for the night.",2022-03-27 09:55:19,cassiopei,tpkfum
Dementia,I think I've got it,"I'm 64. For the past few years, I've had minor memory issues, which I regarded as a normal part of the aging process.

Yesterday, while training someone at work, in mid-sentence I lost a word, the name of an object sitting on the counter. This is new.

I don't have medical insurance; Medicare won't kick in until July at the earliest. Until then, I plan to assume the worst. I'm going to spend the next three months simplifying my life and establishing a regular routine.

If anyone has any suggestions, I'd welcome them. Thanks.","I wouldn't jump straight to dementia.  There's a huge raft of things that could cause this.  My first step would be to get a handle on my health, physical and mental.  Make sure you are getting sufficient sleep and exercise.  Cut out unhealthy dietary habits and excessive drug or alcohol use.  Practice meditation and mindfulness.  Too often, as we age, we try to keep up the sprinting lifestyle we had when we were younger and it's simply too much.
That's a pretty crazy reaction to one small slip up. Being your age it's common to have those sort of memory issues as you say. I'm 20 and I have far, far worse than that. I can barely remember yesterday or week before but then again I have a neurological condition so. Maybe you were just tired, stressed, that day or something else all those variables can cause an instance just as you described of forgetfulness it's not a sure sign you are developing alzheimers or any other form of dementia though. If you are eating a good diet, taking well a balanced multi-vitamin & mineral supplement, and getting adequate sleep and exercising 3-5 times per week I would say you would be fine. 

Keeping your mind active and talking to people is one of the best ways to delay the onset of dementia of any kind and by the sounds of it you work a job that requires intellectual engagement and social engagement so that's good in itself. But if you are really worried you are developing it you could go to your general doctor and ask them to test you for dementia. Where I live they do a MMSE (mini mental state examination) this gives a general overview of cognitive and memory function be sure to voice your concerns with your doctor and get them to rule out other things too as depression, autoimmune disease, sleep apnea can all cause symptoms that mimic dementia. So be sure to rule all else out and maybe see a neurologist and order a MRI scan, CT scan, PET scan these scans can usually rule out dementia. 

And for my own personal experience my mums mother had dementia at age 80 it started and she had no idea she had it she just started leaving things on and doing strange things. 2016 she was put in the home and within 3 years she passed of alzheimers dementia and advanced lung cancer (as she was a lifetime smoker.) My dad's mother also got dementia about 2016 when she was 75 and she went until 2020 when she was 80 before being put in the home, again she wasn't aware she was sick with it and she has become completely non-verbal now. And my dad's father also has it now too it was within one year 2021 that he went down hill he is 85 now and his dementia is quite rapidly progressing. He is in complete denial and again has no idea he has dementia. So I'm just trying to reasure you that it's often the family members who recognise the dementia signs before the person themselves and also its quite a quick progression in most cases depending on the type but yeah as I said if your worried ask your doc to check it out. All the best to you.👍
This happens to me not infrequently, and I’m in my forties. Happens to people without dementia of all ages. Sure, get tested and make plans for this eventuality if it’s comforting (really we should all do it). But first ensure it’s not something like a sleep issue (do you snore?) or other health issue.
So sorry you are experiencing this, OP. You can take a SAGE test and share results with your doctor. You have great instincts as far as getting things in order, that’s never a bad idea. 

Suggestion to look into long term healthcare insurance before a diagnosis because it can help when you might need it. There are medications which can slow progress, etc but a prescription is necessary. My Mum used the Brain Jog app, there are others, which are purported to help with dementia. 

Wishing you the very best.

SAGE test:  https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/brain-spine-neuro/memory-disorders/sage
Dementia is more than just memory loss but has a lot do do with problem solving and critical thinking skills. Before you arrive at suspicion, a few other types of red flags might be apparent.

And, if you are worried and want to focus on prevention or delaying any such things, read all about it and see what is recommended for prevention. Diet, exercise, keeping your mind fit is key.
Get regular sleep. Take lion's mane mushroom. Drink coffee. Challenge your mind by learning completely new things, such as a new language, instrument or skill, like juggling.
If you ""think"" you got it, you probably don't. Not able to find the right word is common after these last few years addressing COVID. I've done it, my wife who is 10 years younger has done it, our daughter does it and she doesn't even live with us. From what I've seen the past 4 years taking care of my MIL, when dementia overtakes you, you will ""know"" you don't have it.
My aunt is still in the beginning phase but actually, maybe she is in a moderate stage. Anyway, establishing a regular routine is an awesome idea. Muscle memory is your friend. I’d also look into getting a smaller, inexpensive Echo Dot from Amazon and hook it into your WiFi. I have memory issues, too so I use Alexa all day long. “Alexa, remind me to give aunt her meds at 2 pm and 8 pm every day. Alexa, what day is it? Alexa, what is the weather forecast.” Alexa, set a water time for 15 minutes (to remind myself to turn off the rpinjler). Alexa, wake me up at 7 am.” It takes awhile to get used to giving her commands so sooner rather than later so she is part of your routine. 

Question: Do you have any family members who live nearby and are you in touch with them on a regular basis?
I sincerely doubt you have dementia. But, just for a moment, lets say you *do.* If I discovered I had dementia before it had really kicked in, the absolute first thing I would do is get on Donepezil. Before anything else, this would be step one.
I agree with others these word blips happen on occasion- it happened to me a couple times in my early 20s when introducing friends to one another. Names were gone!  My 20 something daughter occasionally loses a word. 

Memory loops and difficulty with her checkbook were the obvious indicators for my mom.",2022-03-27 00:23:45,,tpcdm9
Dementia,"Does writing things down, Memento style, work?","Dumb question, I know. But I would guess if I woke up the next day and my alleged son told me I had dementia, the first thing I would do would be to take notes. Take notes of everything I learn or relearn. Do people with dementia tend to do that? Does it work to any extent?","No. Dementia robs us of the ability to make sense of things like notes from ourselves. 

I love that film, but Leonard was choosing to forget that he’d killed his wife and knew he couldn’t remember the past. With dementia, you don’t know you have it. 

As Beaudelaire writes in The Generous Gamester, and Verbal Kint reiterates in The Usual Suspects, the greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing us he didn’t exist. That’s dementia.

Edited to add: I have experience with Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia only, and it’s anecdotal. I’m not a doctor.
It doesn't really work, no.

Dementia doesn't just affect short term memory. It affects working memory, executive function, the ability to plan and reason, the ability to read and write, and everything in between. We tried to make calendars/memos/notebooks work for my mom, but gave up quickly. 

Early on, she could write things down. But she wouldn't REMEMBER that she had written them down. She wouldn't remember to reference her notebook/calendar. And the notebook/calendars just because new things for her to misplace! She filled dozens of notebooks/calendars, never able to remember that these tools didn't actually help her or that she would inevitably lose her new notebook in a matter of days.

As her dementia progressed, she lost the ability to read and write, and lost all sense of time. It's no help to her to have a memo that says that her niece's baby shower is on April 2nd, because she doesn't know what day it is today, how far away 'April 2nd' is, or what she will need to do plan for the shower before that date. 

You can't remember what you can't remember. You can't remind yourself of little details like names/dates/etc. when the whole foundation of memory has eroded. So, unfortunately, this method doesn't help.
I have bought so many notebooks for my mom because she used to be a pharmacist and was methodical so it made sense for her to want to write stuff down...as she got worse she'd kind of remember and they would get partially used and forgotten. I ended up hiding them so she doesn't get confused. 

The only things I keep are her puzzle books because I can show her she completed them. She feels proud of herself seeing that stuff, so I'd rather her be happy than confused about some note she wrote to herself.
In our case, she can't write anymore (vascular dementia). I think she can still read some but writing is too difficult. I know some people use big white boards with things written on them. Date, day of the week, who is the current caregiver in the home. We haven't tried that because at this point someone is always with her.
My mother would write her pulse down  sometimes up to ten times daily. But with dementia activities one obsesses on changes. 

My father (vascular d) wrote stories however that stopped. One thing he did until he was hospitalized was drive his side-by-side Kawasaki mule all over our rural ranch.
It works during a brief window while the dementia is still very mild. But more for specific scenarios ('turn off lights' taped to the inside of the car door) than for general stuff like calendar notes/'you have dementia'.
Sadly no.  My grandmother writes *everything* down in her daytimer and will read and reread it constantly.  I mean, it is good for up to a point... it reminders her of when she has things scheduled to do and tells her when she did things in the past, but... well, sometimes she will read and re-read everything that happened that month aloud to us, over and over again, many multiple times within the space of an hour or so.  She can't remember what she's read just minutes before.
In the first couple years after his Alzheimer’s diagnosis, my dad could keep track of things to a pretty good degree by using post-it notes and keeping a small notebook in his shirt pocket.  But, as the disease progressed, as mentioned by others, the ability to remember to refer to the written reminders, or to understand what the reminder even meant, and eventually to even really write - all that goes away.
When my husband was first diagnosed he recorded a couple videos to himself. One was about driving ( you really can’t drive anymore. I know you think you can but you can’t endanger innocent families on the road…etc) and the other was a “listen to your wife” ( this is your wife…you love her and she loves you. She’s looking out for you and if she’s trying to do something, it’s because it’s to keep you safe and healthy so dont give her a hard time. ) 

Those are the only things that have actually worked. I’ve had to play those videos back to him a couple times and each time it kind of took the wind out of his sails and calmed him down and he became more reasonable.  

Things he wrote down mean nothing. He will read the same thing over and over and it doesn’t get it in.
My dad can’t really write notes for himself, but he has a calendar diary where we write his appointments and plans in and he checks it every day; it really helps him feel like he isn’t losing control. He also responds to written instructions as he obviously can’t remember them, so we have written notes by the phone, etc to help him use them. At some point I’m sure he won’t be able to read them or take them in, but for now it’s helping
My mom does this. Mostly people's numbers and times of events. She's also obsessed with her digital date and time clock. Not sure how long her ability to write will last. It seems to be deteriorating quiet fast.
Mom doesn't write notes but I sometimes do!

Early on I got her a dry erase board that I would put notes on. Say I stopped by and she was sleeping so I'd leave out her meds and write a note to take them.  Or if I wasn't going to stop by until later in the day I'd write 'gmmiller is at sew day with her friends, she will be here at 4pm'.

She is now stage 5/6, very advanced vascular dementia.   I still have a dry erase board in her room at the home.  Sometimes she gets on a kick about sometihing - like going home. So I write ""This is your home"" or ""This is a nice place"" or whatever.  She will walk over to it and read it 20 times a day.  

Most of the time I write silly things.  One of my favorites is 'I’m retired, but I work part-time as a pain in the ass.' Of course this fits her old sense of humor.
Momento??? Yikes. And it probably depends on the stage. 

I think for dad, probable alzeimers, mid stage, it worked for awhile for simple, immediate things. For example, mom would put a big note on the refrigerator ""No breakfast today! Blood Test"" and that worked a few times. 

He still carries around a little notepad in his front pocket.  He can't really use it any longer but he still likes to have it. A few days ago he sidled up to me with his conspiratorial look as though he was going to impart some important wisdom. He handed me a note with my name on it. Maybe he was worried I forgot my name as he always does? Even with cognitive decline, he's so thoughtful. ❤ 😉

We do still keep a paper calendar with appointments in front of the Dementia clock and he reads it several times a day. He still understands enough to know there is or isn't something on the calendar that day.
For awhile we had post it notes all over the place!  The husband would write something down he wanted to remember then next moment look at the note and not have a clue what it meant or would post it somewhere and forget it.  Notes don't work, they don't have the ability to track what they are doing and with the short term memory loss it is all meaningless to them.
The momento thing won’t work but do it anyway because it’s worth a shot. I’m a home care nurse and it’s fascinating to see how each individual copes, so you do you.",2022-03-26 17:36:30,GobeksizTepe,tp4q3r
Dementia,Advice for distracting someone who is distressed they do not recognise their current home?,Disclaimer: I’m not the carer. The person is able to be distracted to an extent but is getting to the stage where they are mentally gone back to their childhood and the place they lived then. They’re becoming afraid and looking for help to get back there and the usual distractions aren’t working. Any suggestions?,"Teepa Snow, a dementia specialist, mentioned diverting with holding a conversation that starts of something like, ""Tell me about your house. What does it look like?"" Then after the person's somewhat distracted by the conversation, gently steer it to something else a little at a time to something else and keep them engaged until they're calm and ready to do something else.

It worked with my mom to steer her away from being upset about her hallucinations that the neighbor was shooting her cats ( which were right in front of her in her house, safe and sound). She'd call, in tears, and I'd start off asking her if she was sure it was her cats and not something else he was shooting. Then I threw in, ""He could've been doing like he did once before when you asked him to come shoot a groundhog that was eating your garden."" Then moved on to "" Remember when Dad used to shoot varmints for you?"" Turned that into a happy memory about how the day after hunting season an 8 point buck walked right up into our yard and stared in the window at Dad, like it was taunting him. Before it was over, she was helping me plan how to make a quilt and talking to one of her ""dead"" cats that had conveniently climbed into her lap.

Sometimes they circle back and you may have to as well several times but if you keep calm and keep talking and diverting, usually it will work.
Narrow the focus to something meaningful and positive they like such as pictures, music, exercise, animals or other hobbies etc.  That should help with minimizing agitation.",2022-03-26 17:29:37,morbidpigeon,tp4l50
Dementia,Experience with the guardianship process in the US with a loved one that has ninja-on-steroids-level suspicion of family and friends trying to steal?,"TL;DR: how to explain guardianship process to loved one, and looking for ideas on how to convince her to go to assisted living without POA or guardianship due to guardianship process taking too long.

Summary:

My first concern is if/how I should explain the guardianship process to my aunt. She is going to be served notice of the guardianship application next week. She is extremely savvy. Her logic may not be largely intact, but she owned a nursing agency for 30 years and was a very successful, independent woman, and her drive and tenacity have not left her yet. She's aware enough to know the objective of guardianship is take control of her finances (in addition to her medical care). Any ideas on how to spin it so it's not as threatening to her?

Lastly, does anyone have experience convincing or coercing someone who refuses to leave their home into assisted living (without POA or guardianship)? Guardianship will likely take another 6mo, and we don't have enough liquid assets to keep her in her home that long. A caseworker mentioned telling my aunt she needs to stay somewhere for a couple weeks while the house is fixed up. It's a good idea, but my aunt has already figured out it's a ruse. My fear is she'll completely cut off all contact if I try to do anything and then we won't be able to care for her.

Details:

I am in AZ and going through guardianship process in Harris County, TX for my aunt that has Lewy Bodies dementia. She has no children, no POA (too late now), and will not add anyone to her bank accounts. She requires 24/7 care as a fall risk and she's losing the ability to care for herself.

The issue is she is almost out of liquid assets to fund her 24/7 care and refuses to go to assisted living. She says she ""will die in her home"". She has other assets (home, car, misc. collectibles) that could be sold, but she refuses to let anyone help her with finances or selling assets. I'm applying for guardianship, but I'm concerned it will destroy what little goodwill I have left with her. She believes her current condition was caused by a family member assaulting her a few months ago (she actually had a UTI and fell in her home while alone), and that we (family) are trying to put her in a mental institution and steal her assets. I don't take it personally, although my mom (aunt's sister) and other cousins do. My mom is not capable of handling the financial situation, and my cousins are out because my aunt 100% believes they're trying to kill her. I know everyone thinks their LO's suspicions are next level, but my aunt tells every caregiver, medical professional, basically anyone, that we are trying to kill her and steal from her. She spends hours every day talking about it. She has already been committed once due to her paranoia, but they discharged her at first signs of being stabilized. And now she's back home and refuses any medication or treatment. I'm afraid she'll cut off all contact with me and my mom and we won't know if she's being cared for or not.

&#x200B;

Edit: spelling","Perhaps use her paranoia to help you.  Tell her that this will protect her from the cousins.  Make certain the cousins know that you trust and believe them.
I can only offer sympathy. I'm in a very similar position with my mother who's in Louisiana while I'm in Texas. I do have POA, but it's only slightly helpful. She's very determined to stay in her house. I don't know what we're going to do when her money runs out because she won't qualify for medicaid.
Without any legal authority you cannot do anything except hope to convince her and it sounds like she is pretty determined.  Even if you can convince her one minute, she could change her mind the next minute.  From your description I can’t think of anything that would work to convince her.  The paranoia you describe is very common and just about impossible to deal with.

And you need to be careful about trying to coerce her. That may be well-meaning but could be seen as attempting to exploit a vulnerable person.  If you are applying for permanent guardianship, you want to make sure your actions are open and above-board.

My advice would be to check with an attorney- many states have a process for emergency guardianship that will appoint a temporary guardian until the normal guardianship process finishes. As one would expect, the requirements for this are pretty strict, but her short-term financial vulnerability and mental incompetence is exactly the kind of situation emergency guardianship is designed for.
Does she have a doctor? That she trusts?  My Mom was a psychiatric nurse in a nursing home and will only do what a doctor says, but nothing that any of her five, well-educated children suggests.
Whew. This is a terrible situation. I’m sorry you’re having to navigate such a crisis. Dementia is such an odd thing because it’s both the same as others’ experiences and completely different. You clearly know and understand your aunt better than anyone else, so if things I say don’t precisely jive with her, try to tweak it to fit more with her personality. My mom was extremely proud and very resistant to any notion that there was something wrong with her. It’s harder in the early stages when they still sorta have their mind in tact. My mom was difficult to adjust to things along the way, not quite as intense a level as your aunt, but with some things, yeah she was totally impossible to handle. We sorta had to wait until she had declined enough to move her, otherwise the ruse wouldn’t have worked as well. It just takes time. 

We had her best friend pick her up and take her out to lunch while we set up her room at memory care. Then a few days later her husband took her out again, but at some point he started mentioning (possibly faked a phone call?) that “there was a burst pipe at home and the whole place was flooded - absolute chaos. So for the time being we’ve got another great space set up where you’ll be more comfortable while the construction crew works.” Add whatever kinds of details that would be of concern to the person or seem more plausible, etc. Just try to maintain a positive disposition and meet any fear or resistance from her with confidence and ease. Be reassuring and just keep moving the goalposts, as she’ll inevitably wanna leave and go home for the first few weeks, months. Basically you wanna gaslight her…. It’s a horrible way to put it but it’s essentially what you have to do. You gotta get real comfortable with lying to her. 

To make the transition to the new space easier, we used a lot of her own stuff to decorate it in a familiar way, so it felt as much like “home” as possible. But I don’t know if your aunt is so paranoid and suspicious that she’d immediately notice if some of her things weren’t there… Ok, I’m thinking… 

Oh! I might have an idea. Quick story first to better help illustrate what I’m thinking: So, my mom broke her femur in 2015, had surgery and long recovery. The trauma of the leg break plus the time in hospital and rehab, and just the process of being “put under” anesthesia — it all was the kickstarter to her cognitive decline. When I was visiting the hospital one day back then, after surgery — and again, this was pre-dementia anything. I didn’t know the first thing about dementia — she was very upset just being in the hospital at all, wanted to leave and was so anxious and no matter what I did or said to distract her to make her happy, her anxiety wheels just kept turning and she just incessantly was wanting to leave, begging me to take her. After trying so many times to reason with her, I looked around the room suspiciously, then leaned close to her and whispered “look, I’m gonna sneak you outta here…but you gotta be patient. We have a whole plan - me and the siblings. Everyone’s gonna help out but we gotta wait for the right time so just try to stay calm and we’ll get home soon enough.” Her whole face lit up man. “REALLY?!” she said. And she got so giddy and excited about it, happy that we were being devious and breaking the rules. She was totally quiet and calm, eventually fell asleep. 

So I don’t know, I’m thinking maybe you should do something like another commenter mentioned, and use her suspicions to manipulate her into trusting that you are the one who wants to help her? I don’t know exactly what would seem believable to her, so you be the judge. But if you can somehow form an alliance with her where there’s no doubt in her mind that you’re on her side? You gotta start small, but eventually you maybe could convince her to start letting you move stuff into storage to hide it from greedy family, etc? Then maybe you can start selling things to make money to cover her until the guardianship goes thru? I think I saw someone else here or in another post talk about the “foot in the door approach”… it’s a sales thing but it’s usable with dementia stuff too. If you can get her to agree to smaller things, easing her down the road she’s on little by little, you’ll have a much easier time with the bigger transitions

Question: this will be served to her by a clerk or process server? Or just mail? Is it possible you could intercept? Cause I think you’d be best off if you could control the pacing of everything, and not have it just happen to her one day. 

Another big piece of the puzzle I learned from being with mom, was that she was much much easier to keep calm and happy if we didn’t let her get to the worked-up/anxious states. You do this by anticipating needs and just having her world be exactly how she likes for her to be content. Or more simply, just keep the bad shit away from her, whatever that means in her situation. 

I realize your timeline isn’t long, with the money running out and such. If there simply isn’t enough time to get her fully comfortable with all the changes,  the best you can do is just be reassuring and kind. Smart, independent savvy women like your aunt and my mom will fight tooth and nail to not be seen as weak or not in control. Unfortunately the high intellect makes it easier for them to cover up the signs of cognitive decline, and more stubborn during the most critical early stages. 

If everything fails and she locks everyone out and refuses any help whatsoever, I think at that point you have to get professionals involved. I don’t know which is the right govt agency for this but it would be my next step. 

The good news is that eventually it’ll all be forgotten by her, so don’t worry about her hating you or being angry. She’ll get over it. Just play it cool and when she can’t be reasoned with or tricked, just agree with her and move on. Keep trying later. I hope some of this is helpful to you, but it’s not easy to get every little nuance from a single post about someone. So I’m sorry if I missed anything or misunderstood details. Please feel free to reach out if you need anymore brainstorming.",2022-03-26 13:13:26,sweeta1c,toy57i
Dementia,Question regarding aggressive behaviour possibly due to dementia in a causal relationship,"I’m new to this sub, so please excuse any ignorance or insensitivity I may show on this subject. I am distantly familiar with some of the behavioural changes that may occur because of dementia. I feel for those who are coping with unusual and new behaviour from loved ones which causes hurt and pain from this condition.

My question has to do with people we know through causal relationships  who may be showing signs of dementia. I met a woman nine years ago through a hobby we both share. At the time, she was early 60’s and seemed like a kind, good humoured, and well adjusted woman. She has no kids, divorced years ago, and no family in the community. She has friends who I know very casually.

I have recently become reacquainted with her through our shared hobby. She’s early 70’s now and seems like a different person. Paranoid, agitated, and angry. She’s also prone to outbursts. Because I’ve heard of behavioural changes caused by dementia, I am wondering if she is showing early signs. It’s hard to believe she’s the same person. I didn’t  know her well in our first social interaction nine years ago, because when I am involved in my hobby, I’m pretty focussed. I’m pretty sure that I would have had an inclination if her current behaviour was a true reflection of her character.

I’m hoping this makes some sense. My gut tells me this disturbing behaviour is somehow caused by dementia or some sort of degeneration. Going on this assumption, I’m wondering what is best way to handle aggressive verbal outbursts. I’ve been biting my tongue because any response seems to agitate her, but it’s wearing and I can’t always avoid her.

I have observed her having these outbursts with others involved with our shared hobby, and I see most people trying to avoid her. She complains that people ignore her because of her age, and I can see this hurts her. Sadly, it’s not ageism, it’s simply people trying to avoid being verbally abused, or listening to her viciously gossip about others. Talking her through situations only seems to cause more agitation. 

I know she has a couple of close friends in the community, so I’m hoping she’s getting some needed social support. I am not inclined to get involved too deeply in her life, as I have my own life and responsibilities. I guess I’m seeking advice on best ways to handle the situation.","Sadly I think your inkling is correct. A very tragic part of dementia is that some years before the patient shows any medical symptoms, it oftentimes basically turns them mean, makes them disregard social etiquette and other peoples feelings, burns their relationships. It is really hard to watch. Do you know any of her adult children or other family? Or could find them on social media perhaps
Yes! There could, of course, be many other things going on. Brain tumor. Bipolar. Who knows what chemical or physical imbalances can cause this. 

I had found a peer reviewed journal article a few years ago, which I've since lost track of, that suggested sudden shifts to anger could presage dementia.

My partner is newly diagnosed with literal dementia. The type is as yet unspecified. But for about 5-7 years, about a decade ago, she started going bat-sh#t crazy angry at me. Foaming at the mouth, raging, totally unrealistic outbursts at real or imagined slights. If true, I would have qualified as the lowest pond-scum on the planet. Then flipping to apologetic grovelling. Yeah, I nearly dumped her. 

After that, suicidality, worsening anxiety, depression, cling-wrapping on me.  Social butterfly who pushed all friends away on flimsy excuses about their being ""bad"" people. 

There was a rotating list of mental health diagnoses, drugs, talk therapy, and what-not, all spectacularly unsuccessful. She never told her therapists about her rages. I kept bringing up dementia with docs, getting brushed off as an ignoramus. There were other, more classic hallmark signs developing. Well… duh.  And careful what you wish for. We finally found out *why* but it's cold comfort. 

It's my understanding that frontotemporal dementia can manifest as personality changes. I am NOT an expert. 20/20 hindsight, at least some of it seems to have been caused by a sense of losing control, missed social cues, and wanting to hide her inability to figure out what objective reality for everyone else actually was. 

How to deal? Oof, tough one. Set your own boundaries, and enforce them. I tend to be blunt. It might be kindness to sit down in a quiet moment with her and discuss, suggest a consult with her PCP; ""this doesn't sound like you. I know you to be X, but I see you doing Y."" From my experience, don't try to engage in a ""hot"" moment; wait for a calmer period.
Without getting involved, the only thing I can think that might be a good thing to do would be calling adult protective services and explaining your observations and concerns that she could be dealing with this completely on her own and might not be safe. That's a 2-edged sword though. If they find that she's exhibiting signs of dementia and they can't find a family member to be responsible for her, she'll get thrown into a system that's as random and sometimes as scary as the foster care system can be, with a guardian who could be good or bad.

Dementia,can low oxygen cause temporary dementia symptoms?,"Hello, everyone! I was wondering if anyone could help answer the above question. My dad is currently 67 years old, has a pacemaker, uses oxygen, and about month ago was in the hospital for internal bleeding (I never found out the reason) and seemed to be doing as okay as anyone could be afterwards. However, he came over to my house today to meet my new dog, he didn't bring his oxygen with him, but all seemed normal until he asked me something along the lines of ""Do you remember the little dog mom and dad had? the one they had when you left."" I couldn't remember what he was talking about. I asked ""the dog your parents had or mom's parents?"" he said his parents, and then a little later corrected and said ""The little dog my parents had when Carol moved out"". Carol is my aunt, his sister. Im almost positive with the way he worded his question earlier that he was mistaking me for his sister, something he has never done before. They left about 5-10 minutes later so my dad could go back on oxygen at home.

I haven't discussed this with my mother yet, but I'm planning to soon. This seems like an early sign of dementia but I was wondering if this kind of confusion could happen because his oxygen levels were low or if this is something long term? Any answers or advice is greatly welcomed. Thanks!

TLDR; Dad mistook me for his sister while potentially low on oxygen. Early sign of dementia or temporary confusion caused by low oxygen?","I'm not in the medical field, so I don't want to say anything out of turn, but if you google hypoxia symptoms (low oxygen), one of them is confusion. If you then Google the term confusion with regards to mental state, mixing up or not recognizing people is part of the description. So, it seems like it could be. 

However, a neurological work up is probably a good idea, just to be sure one way or the other.
I honestly think it exacerbated the symptoms of dementia. My dad has really bad sleep apnea and I feel that has contributed to his quick decline in his mental faculties.
There is a recent NPR “This American Life” where they go into the process of death. One story shared how a person needing oxygen was meaner after having oxygen administered. I am sure everything is different, but this was a truly fascinating listen. 
https://www.thisamericanlife.org/523/death-and-taxes
My grandmother recently had a pulmonary  embolism and was placed on oxygen as needed and since I’ve been doing around the clock oxygen meter reading for the last two weeks since she got home from the hospital and was worried her first week because her numbers was like 84-88 and when I brought up to her primary care during the follow up. He mentioned that it’s not usually for dementia to cause low oxygen, (like people forget to breathe)/ so not the other way around and causing dementia. 

/ pretty grim but the way Alzheimer’s actually eventually kills is making people forget to breathe..",2022-03-26 05:33:02,intothestrange,tokzbi
Dementia,Finally saw my mom,"I am blind so my husband drove me an hour to where she was assigned.  I had not been sleeping for days.  My body was so fraught with grief, anxiety, tension.  

The staff greeted us warmly. Did the self covid test before going in.  

My mom was shrunken, pale, week.  The cancer eats her so that she cannot eat.  But dementia forgets this.  She asked me to pray, feed her, and hug her. She drank a few drops of liquid.  She tired. We left.  

I know it sounds terrible, but a weight was off me. My brother too (he's the poa/decision maker). 

Tonight I am calm.  I can sleep.",I'm glad you were able to find some peace after being with her. It's hard.,2022-03-26 00:11:53,Littlebiggran,toglkn
Dementia,Talking to loved one about the memory problems,"My grandmother (77) has been acting strange over the past year or year and a half. It started with her forgetting little things more often, having more problems cooking, and needing more help with technology related tasks. Not unusual, except sometimes these tasks were things like changing the batteries in her remote. Then she wanted to add Mom onto her bank account to help her make sure her bills are paid and everything. In all fairness, though, she was preparing to go stay with my Aunt for a few months, so it made sense to have us handle that stuff. She's back from her trip, though, and it's a lot easier to see the changes. Still nothing massive, but she's repeating the same stories a lot, the dogs got fed twice the other night because she forgot Mom had already fed them (she was in the room when they ate the first time and definitely saw), things like that. She's also been kind of mean to my mother lately, and the other day, she accused us of throwing some of her cups away. That also isn't like her, but she and my mother have fought before, 

She brought it up to me earlier. Someone with Alzheimer's happened to come up in conversation, and she made a comment about how she knows she's going to end up like that someday, she just doesn't know when. It's worth mentioning that she knows a good bit about Alzheimer's. She was a psychiatric nurse for awhile, and both her mother and her husband had it before they passed, and she was their caretaker. She also said that she knows my aunt thinks she's having memory problems, but she doesn't think they're that bad yet. I asked her gently if she's seen a doctor about it, and she said no, she didn't think it was necessary. I suggested that it might be a good idea, because maybe she just needs to use Oxygen for her COPD more often or something similar. She just said that she doesn't think she's out to lunch yet, and that it isn't that big of a deal yet. I wasn't sure what to say and I agreed. I figure that it's still kind of true because aside from maybe needing a little more guidance in her finances just to make sure everything is covered, nothing is preventing her from taking care of herself yet. But is there a best way to talk to loved ones about this? She's not the type to be afraid of talking about this kind of thing. She's been continuously making adjustments to her will to make sure everything is right just in case for the past 20 years, at least, she has already paid for her funeral and picked everything out (except for the flowers, because she doesn't know what season she'll pass in), toured several nursing homes for herself as well as papa, and let us know which one she'd like to be in if it was impossible for her to stay at home, etc.","I believe if she exhibits a willingness to talk about it then you can proceed with caution. It's a very nuanced thing that requires a lot of feedback in the moment to make a judgement call. 

I recently had a discussion with my aunt about her 'confusion' and 'memory issues'. She is in the moderate to advanced stages of Lewy Body. Similar to your example, my aunt brought it up by saying she heard someone talking about her being confused. In this case, it happened to be a hallucination, but she ultimately asked me about her confusion. I only discussed it in the context of making her feel better. I said it's okay that she has confusion and memory issues and that the family is here to help her. She was more concerned that her friends and outsiders would know that she has mental health problems, but I assured her that it's not the case.

Your situation is likely different, but you'll have to read your grandmother in the moment to know (1) if it's something she wants to discuss, and (2) if it help her in any way to know or discuss it. The second one is the hard part in my opinion.
Maybe if you frame it as wanting to put your mind at ease that she's getting enough oxygen or doesn't have an infection that could be causing it, it might get her to go? It would really suck if she's having issues because of a delerium that can be treated because she's accepted her fate as having dementia.

If course, caregivers of dementia patients are more likely because of the stress to get it themselves.
It’s great that she has been so thoughtful about planning the future and having her adult kids help with bank accounts and finances. This is rare. Many patients live in denial. But you need to harness one of these conversations she brings up about planning in case she needs more help in the future. Eventually, she will never talk about it willingly again.

if you/family haven’t got durable POA (if in the US) you MUST get that done. POA MUST be signed while one is still “of sound mind” so by the time you NEED it, it’s too late to acquire. 

I do not advise saying “the time when you need more help is now”.  Continue with the “in case you got hit by a bus tomorrow” line of thinking. Paranoia is common as the disease progresses. Many patients do not see their own symptoms and they believe that when other people tell them they have dementia, that they are being gaslit and duped to get their money stolen etc. So this obviously conflicts with signing papers such as POA. 

If you do explain mention that she will get home care aides or move to a nursing home because she needs help, I advise focusing on any physical ailments she has, or prevention against risk of injury. NOT the memory problems.",2022-03-25 21:51:22,shy-butterfly-218,toc93u
Dementia,He went through 12+ rolls of toilet paper in a week,"I NEED HELP 

My fil in December got confused and thought he needed to wipe his ass everytime he peed. With kidney failure that’s every 10 minutes. So to remind him I put a sign above the toilet paper “for poop only” and put a lock on my cabinet where I keep tp. 
It was all good until about 2 weeks ago. When I realized there was a couple empty tubes in the trash. Weird but I’m also kinda lazy so I figured I hadn’t changed the trash in a while. I changed the trash and left 3 rolls+1 on the dispenser so I could keep an eye on it. 


Well a week later my wife let me know that the trash was full as she knew I was keeping an eye on it. There was 12 empty rolls in the trash and my container was half full we learned he can open the cabinet. Of course I hid all the tp and tissues (upstairs where he can’t find it) 

We now give him 3-4 square unless he poop then we check to see if he poop (because he will lie to you trying to get tp) then give him a reasonable amount 


This now has caused the issue where he will sit and push to try and poop just to get tp. And tell you he was diarrhea (he doesn’t) 


Help. I’m out of ideas. He can’t use a bidet he’s too far passed that.","My cute little 80 year old aunt who lives in a cute little house in a cute little neighborhood went without running water for 8-10 years! and developed some really weird bathroom habits. She uses way too much toilet paper. The roto rooter guy said we will probably have to have the line cleared every 8-12 months. I don’t know what to do either. He recommended we switch to Scott 100 toilet paper instead of the Charmin we were using. I have no idea if it’s going to help or not.
If you need any toilet paper, let me know. My MIL is constantly tearing 3 or 4 sheets of tp and folding them into perfect little squares and putting them in her pockets. Sometimes she'll give a wad to my wife to give to me, ""in case 'the man that lives here' needs it"". We find little stacks all over the house in drawers, or on tables, or in clean clothes in her closet. There's even a stack in her bathroom on the vanity and on her towel shelf, right beside the Kleenex. Yesterday there was a stack of them sitting on top of the actual toilet paper roll. Now if we could just get her to use them to wipe herself with every time, everything would be fine. Well, it would be fine if they were flushed down the toilet instead of thrown into her waste can.
That really sucks, sorry to hear. Was going to suggest bidet, but... yeah. Understandable. Hope you find some kind of solution :(
So sorry.  I have no experience in this issue but wonder if his doc can prescribe some medication which would tamper down his anxiety and obsession.
I went through the exact same thing during the start of Covid and with a couple of adult kids that moved back for work from home. I still have searching for tp nightmares. I don’t have answers for you. My wife also went through a stage where she tried to defecate every time she sat down on the toilet, it only lasted a few months. I can’t tell you how hours I wasted trying to reason with her on how to use the toilet and how her way is not the right way. I was eventually forced to (I wish I would’ve done this earlier) go through the motions with her when using the toilet. I now have a small bench next to the toilet. The bench and the wall on the other side helps corral her in front of the toilet. I then stand close to her while she is facing me in front of the toilet (give me a hug). I pull down her diaper and help lower her down. I am in the perfect position to wrestle her onto the toilet if necessary. On the bench I leave a couple piles of tp and leave her alone.

Recently she’s been fighting me tooth and nail and screaming bloody murder when I pull down her diaper.
Have you tried issuing him a single flushable baby wipe with the 4 squares of TP, just in case he poops? Tell him it is his decision to use it or not if he poops.

Gives him control, he might also feel “fresher” if he uses it.",2022-03-25 21:19:21,Caffeine-addict-,toafug
Dementia,Mean & meaner,"My mother has always been distrustful of everyone, most of all me. Everyone is always out to get over on everyone else, especially family. She handled all her own affairs, no financial advisors, no help from anyone because everyone was always out to cheat or steal. In her mind one ever does anything nice just to be nice, there’s always an ulterior motive. Down to the simplest act like sending a greeting card or gift. Her dementia has only amplified this. On some level I get it. I mean, if I was confused ALL the time I’d be agitated, wondering who I can trust. But I’m her only surviving child, and I’m living a successful life in my own right. And not only do the accusations come all the time, so do the insults. She takes real events and memories and misremembers them, casting me as the bad guy or the idiot all the time. When someone does something she doesn’t like/trust/approve of, I am behind it. I’m so tired of it. I’m killing myself trying to help her, worried about how much work I’m missing for her care, fielding constant phone calls to hear her complaints and calm her anxieties. Only to be insulted and accused of all manner of wrongdoing. I’d like to cut and run, but I’m all she has and I just… I’m not that cruel.
Thanks for letting me vent.","In my experience dementia amplifies already present worries and behaviors: distrustful people become more paranoid, friendly people never meet a stranger, people who worried about money become overwrought with concern, etc. You're doing the best you can for your mom. You know she doesn't understand what is going on and what she's saying is not true. 

My advice: It's okay to take a break. After years of this with various family, I have finally gotten to a point where I am a duck. Your mom's brain is telling her whatever and that's her current reality. It's not yours and you can't do anything to mitigate it beyond what you are already doing.  I am also an only child and taking care of an elderly aunt with no other family. When her/your friends or other family offer to help, take them up on it. Not matter how small. Let someone else make that grocery run, take her a meal or sit with her a few hours today.  She was going to complain regardless, right? You delayed hearing about it and dealing with it in person and need the space. You're allowed the distance to save yourself.
On top of that I do have a brother who is only 30 minutes away and could care less
Omgosh I feel for you OP, that's really tough - I don't know how you manage it.   My older sister has Narcissistic Personality Disorder, so I get it, these types of behaviours.   The things she's done to our mum (who I care for), and myself, are astounding awful.  It's horrendous, and very sad.  It's easy for other folk to say sort of 'forgive & forget' - I'll never forget & 'forgiving' is hard, on the soul.  And you've lost a sibling?  So sorry for that too.  Life sure sucks sometimes.   I hope you get plenty of breaks &/ respites, and therapeutical whatevers.  Fantastic for you to be having a successful happy life, good on you!    \* hugs \*
You have no idea how much I relate. 

My mother had a abusive alcoholic as a father, and an equally mean mother. Her marriage with my Dad went bad for too many reasons on both sides to count. Ever since she left my Dad she has lived on her own. She hates when people try and tell her what to do or hold her accountable, especially if those people are Men. 

So here I am her oldest of three boys and the only one with the means to really care for her. I am paying a decent chunk of my own money to supplement her funds so she can live in assisted living. Prior to moving there she did sign Durable Power of Attorney over to me so I manage everything for her.

This week I got to get told yet again, how I am a manipulating, controlling and awful son. All because I agreed with the nursing staff that she needs to be showering at least once a week.

Every week is the same. I get texted a list of demands of things I need to do for her, like I am the help,  only to them do those things which include buying her groceries (again with my money) only to get yelled at when I visit her in person. I am accused of mismanaging her money constantly, I also get told I “parked” her there at that home and ruined her life. Meanwhile her life was a hot mess before I moved her. I am told I stole her stuff when I moved her and I am just a terrible controlling person. 

Then when I leave angry and hurt, I get desperate phone calls begging for my forgiveness and being told how appalled she is that she treated me the way she did.

It happens virtually every week. 

It is depressing, demoralizing and exhausting. 

No matter how much I tell myself she is taking her anger about her situation out on the only available target (me) I can’t help but fantasize about abandoning her and praying for this all to end soon…and then I tell myself I really am a rotten son.

I don’t just feel your pain, I know it, deep down and it is awful. 

Stay strong.
Dementia brings out the worst in people in my opinion.
I’d also like to say. Another challenge I have is while my mother comes off saccharine sweet to the nursing staff, she’s not. 

In my life she was never mother of the year which makes it more frustrating and challenging. I guess 

I feel like I could be less resentful if she actually went out of her way to help me when I was younger and needed it.
I hear you just went through this with my mom just a short time ago I have locked myself in the garage I am falling apart she hates me never hears me I slapped a magazine out of her hands cause she ignores me to the fullest she does not care that I am the only one who she has and she treats me like shit",2022-03-25 20:53:12,reddit_user498,to9yvw
Dementia,How to deal with Mom,"Both my parents have dementia and I made the idiotic, but well-intentioned, decision to move back in with them to help them. 

Dad was diagnosed around 5 years ago, but has been relatively stable. He and mom are still fully independent, but they sometimes struggle with simple tasks. 

Now, it appears my mother (who is undiagnosed ATM) has suddenly lost the ability to hide her dementia symptoms, which she had been doing potentially for years.

Every single day, she tries to do something super easy, and goes into a tail spin / has a full on meltdown. She repeats the same phrases (“I’m tired, I’m tired!” , “I do all the work”, etc.)

She basically does nothing all day, but tells us and herself, and her friends/family over the phone, that all she does is work all day and how useless me and my father are. She will do 5 minutes of work in a day and will spend the rest of the day about how she hasn’t even had a chance to rest. 

If I try to help her, she inevitably screams at me and explodes, blaming me / calling me a horrible son, worthless, comparing me to more successful cousins / family friends my age.

If I do nothing, she just fills the house with her yelling and cursing. I feel like there is no way to win or help. 

Has anyone experienced this? If so, what remedies have you tried? Hoping there may be an alternative solution that I haven’t thought of or discovered through reading.","She needs a diagnosis and some appropriate medication. An anti-anxiety medicine may help more than you think with her yelling and tailspins.
My mom has similar verbal explosions over percieved attempts to undermine her abilities,particularly regarding doing the dishes and laundry.  She squeezes anyone trying to help out of the way, usually just wiping off the dishes with a paper towel. If I try to put soap on anything or offer to dry for her, she erupts into fits of swearing and similarly hurtful diatribes. If we give her space, she pouts, saying she's the only one doing anything, then storms off to my parent's room, slamming the door like I did in middle school . My dad and I are also at a loss for how to meet all of our needs without these explosions of uncharasteric nastiness.
    I'm sorry you are going at it solo. Your parents  are fortunate to have a great son who hasn't given up  and although they may not express their gratitude, it is felt deeply. Props for your patience and bravery, one parent is hard. I can't imagine both together.
Sounds like an awful situation. First thing I would do, would to be tell anyone who she calls/talks to on the phone that this is part of her dementia, right now, and to ignore it or come over and help out if they suspect you are not telling them the truth.  Then, if I hadn't, I'd talk to her doctor about this situation so they know this is where she is in the disease.  Perhaps the MD can prescribe something to keep her calmer. Then I'd do my best to ignore it.  Sounds like you mom has ""been doing it all"" for several years, it's possible her head is still there.  Finally, I'd bide my time because as her disease progresses, this attitude will likely change.
Oh my goodness my heart goes out to you. As an only child I also am the sole carer of both parents with dementia. Here in the UK there are benefits and social services that exist to help, but it’s still difficult. Both my parents are on medication and it definitely helps. I’m very lucky to have an amazingly supportive husband, daughter, extended family and friends who I can call on in an emergency and I don’t live with my parents thank god- if you can afford it get yourself a small place nearby, for your own sanity! This situation has been a vertical learning curve for me and these are the things I wish I had been told at the beginning:
1. Get powers of attorney before doing anything else, even diagnosis.
2. Get them diagnosed and medicated asap after 1.
3. Apply for all the benefits and reach out to relevant organisations for help to do this.
4. Invest in technology to make your life easier-cameras, trackers etc.
5. Slowly Introduce carers into their routine early on to get them used to other people- we started with 1hr a week.
6. Don’t wait until things get really bad before taking action, put things in place even if you feel they are not really needed yet.

Sending you all the best for the future. Xxx
Don't take anything personally. Do your best. Get any support you can, whether it is hospice or respite, ordering groceries delivered, whatever can help you to help them. You need to put on your oxygen mask first. I don't think dementia meds helped my mom as much as anti anxiety meds did. Behaviorally setting people up for success by giving limited choices, having routines, keeping active, engaging long term memories are good things to help keep some happiness and peace in the home.",2022-03-25 18:47:05,Omeezus901,to4dbb
Dementia,Mom's past mean streak makes it really hard to tell what's dementia and what's her picking on us,"She's always had a propensity toward punching down, casual digs, and generally assuming the world owes her.  Me going to college and having my own life = abandoning her.  Story not unique.

I've been around here long enough to know there's nothing to be done about it.  So I guess I'm just venting.","Oh this is my life too. Not only does it make it difficult to know what's dementia and what's just her being her bitchy self, but it makes it really difficult to talk about or try and intervene. My mother has always acted and assumed she was the smartest person in the room. So her diminishing intelligence is paired with her complete belief that she knows best and doesn't need help. It is so frustrating, I feel your pain!!
'is she being a asshole or is it dementia?' I love that game! /s

I do what I used to do with my kids when they were super little if they bit or hit me: just get up and walk away. For mom I leave the room for five minutes, literally go make myself a cup of tea and play a game on my phone. Will she catch on and check herself? Zero chance, but it makes me feel better haha.
Are you my sister?  We have a similar problem.

With us, mom's meanness in dementia became more rebelling against my sister's help and saying mean things loudly, assuming her targets can't hear.

So she says to me, her fat daughter, ""Look at those fat women!  They're so fat their behinds shake!""  loudly enough for the women in question (thinner than me) could easily hear.  So it was a double-insult.

And the ultimate victim is herself.  Other people aren't friendly (probably because she talks about how fat they are), they give her mean looks (because mom says mean things), and are snobby (though she talks about her fellow residents in assisted living as ""hoboes"").

So I can empathize.  But there really isn't a solution, aside from resolving not to be a nasty old woman like her.
I found that dementia has definitely exacerbated my wife’s peculiarities and quirks.
Yes, I always enjoy that experience when it happens:

**The caregiver / A nurse / A doctor:** ""Oh, don't listen to him. That's just the dementia talking.""

**Me:** ""Actually, that pretty much sounds exactly like my Dad.""
The relief from this for me was just being over my mom's BS when it was at this point.  She would push herself away from the table in her wheelchair and act like she couldn't push herself back to the table.  And I never let it bother me.  She'd say she needed help because it took her too long to push herself back and I would just ask what else she had to do that day.  Epic death stare for 5 minutes until she forgot what happened.
Along these lines, my husband has a very hard time accepting that when his mother can't find the kitchen or puts another pair of underpants on over her pants instead of changing her clothes, it's because her brain function is severely compromised, not because she's f\*\*king with him.
I'm sorry. My mom has always been like that too - the criticism, snide remarks, disapproving looks, not being happy with how I have decided to live. 

These days she has dementia and we are low contact, with occasional video calls, including lots of scowling and snide remarks. I guess the one difference I have noticed is that she fixates on the same things on those calls. I have 3 dogs. Two are usually around during the calls and sometimes pop up on camera. She always has to make some nasty comment about how many dogs to I have anyways?, or that I have too many dogs.

Over the years, I have had to do my best to accept that this is just how she is and try not to take the bait when she is trying to provoke me. It hasn't always been easy, but what else can I really do?

As someone else mentioned she always thought she was superior than others and the smartest person in the room. It seems like she is at the point where she still has some understanding that she is losing her faculties, which must be pretty awful for a person like her.

I live abroad and at the moment I have a family member pressuring me to go visit my mother. If she is that bad on video, I can't imagine spending a week or 10 days in person dealing with that.
Sadly this is also my MIL - she has just gotten more miserable and nasty as the years go on. But only to my SO - her only target because she is a coward abuser at heart. I'm encouraging him to deligate out her care because honestly? She was a horrible parent to him even when she was 100% cognizant. It's not worth the pain to take care of her directly. She's only 67, and I don't want him to suffer years and years of her abuse when he has finally escaped her as an adult and was building his life.
I'm sending you all a virtual hug. My dad died from dementia in June. We took care of him, my 4 siblings and I (actually 3 siblings and I)round the clock for 2 1/2 years. We've been asked numerous times if our dad was mean, nasty, argued and fought us. Our answer is no and they are amazed. He had 0.5 ativan at night, he would sun down pretty bad. It helped him sleep and allow us to also. He was a simple, gentle man who took care of everybody and he aways said ""family is everything"". Sounds like even with dementia, he stayed true to himself
Oh this was my mom too, after a complete personality change.  You need to live your life!  Hope that is what she truly wanted — think most parents do want that for their children.

I picked my mom up today to take her to the dr. She told me my hair looked like shit . She’s always been that way.
I suspected dementia because my mom was being nice. After years of being a self proclaimed bitch she started smiling and patting my hand. She has lived in our mom in law apt for years and we only communicated through email. Looking back on them I can now see how many years she's had it. She's 80 and I'm still nervous about telling her to do literally anything.",2022-03-25 10:47:07,erroneousneophyte,tnnjaq
Dementia,Helping transition to assisted living,"TLDR: Many folks here have talked about hard transitions they had with loved ones when they arrived at assisted living. I was curious if you found any particular actions or activities as helpful in turning the tide. 

By next week we’ll have moved my mom, who has mid to severe dementia, to an assisted living facility near my home (after a cross country move). 

A source of guilt is that we’re choosing not to discuss the living arrangement in detail. She knows she’ll have care (she already has it in her house). But travel with her even in health was difficult, and she’s generally happy at the idea of coming for an extended stay with us. So we don’t want to discuss things that might bring anxiety to the move process, and she’d probably forget anyway.

A source of anxiety then is how she’ll react when we’re there, since we won’t have discussed it. I keep telling myself that it’s not my pre-dementia mom we’re doing this for. That we can’t expect any particular response even if we discussed it at length. So we’ll just improvise as we go.

The anxiety above is why I’m posting to get feedback on people’s experiences, what works.

Her facility is really wonderful. As far as they are concerned we should give my mom as much space as possible, that they are willing/expecting to do the work to gain her trust and make her happy. My inclination is to visit every day, though, at least early on, so that there’s somewhat of a vacation feel to the initial few weeks. Then we can start integrating longer solo periods (e.g. I have work today, kids have after school, see you tomorrow) or something like that.","The stress of the move will likely exacerbate her condition.  When we moved mom she had hallucinations, which she hasn't had since. 

I stayed with her for the first week.   She was very confused - were we visiting my sister?  Was she visiting my house?

So it's unpredictable what reaction she'll have, you'll need to be prepared for almost anything.

Know that visiting regularly is wonderful and very much needed.  But if you miss a day she may notice on the day, but not remember the  next day.  Also, you may visit or call every day and she still says she hardly ever sees or hears from you.

Two important things to bear in mind:

People with dementia live in the present moment, so avoid talking about the past or future (besides saying ""see you tomorrow."").  Talk about the weather, the pretty flowers on the table, the nice sweater she's wearing.  This is especially important as a distraction if she's fixated on something like going home or driving a car.

We don't like the idea of lying, but sometimes it's helpful to lie to the disease.  So instead of saying ""No you can't get a car you have dementia."" it's more helpful to say something like ""Ok, what kind of car do you want?"" then bring the subject back to the cute cat over there.

There's nothing easy about this process, but your mom will be much safer in assisted living.
We are moving my Dad this coming Monday into a memory care facility.  It is brand new (only opened 3 months ago) and currently only has about 14 residents.  He is taking his golden retriever with him.  We knew we had to find a facility that allowed his dog to be with him.  So far, we have been very impressed with this facility although we’ll obviously know better once he is there.

My sister and I went back and forth as to what to tell him.  Finally, we decided to tell him what was in store and, if he reacted ok, we would continue to discuss and gently remind him as we approach the day.  If he reacted badly, we would drop the subject, take him on Monday and deal with it however necessary on site.  Fortunately, at least as best we can tell, he reacted favorably.  While I’m not sure he fully comprehended, he seemed to agree that he needed more help than we could continue to provide (especially since sister - who he lives with - just got a new job with a lot of travel requirements), that it would be better for us all if we could be father/daughters rather than nurses or caregivers.  It’s not easy to tell whether he fully grasped what we were telling him.  He kept mentioning that his dog had been replaced by a different dog and, while he liked the new one fine, he preferred his old one and wondered what happened to him.  We assured him that the dog was the same dog but when we got home, we would assess to make sure (we were out to lunch at a restaurant).  When he got home and saw his dog, he burst into happy tears as he recognized it as his “old” dog.  Later, he brought up the topic from lunch and said he thought it was a good idea (again, we think/hope he meant the move but his communication skills are iffy).  Nevertheless, we felt a lot better knowing that we had given him a head’s up and, of course, that he seemed to accept.
I've taken my wife to memory care for a 5 day respite every 3 months for the last nine months. Every time, I’ve told her “ you’re are going to get a vacation and be with a lot of nice people and make new friends”. She put the idea in my head when she saw me packing her clothes and said something about all the clothes. When I took her the next morning I got her out of the car and took her to the front door with her bags, and took a pic of her smiling when I told her she was at her vacation spot and people were waiting inside for her. Same thing each of the three times, and she enjoyed each one. ( not that she completely understood everything I was telling her each time, but I tried to present it like it was a fun thing)
Schedule a meeting between yourself, your mom, and the activity director to discuss your mom's interests relative to regularly scheduled activities (arts & crafts, games, light physical exercise, etc.) The activity director should help to remind/include your mom when her favorite activities are scheduled and introduce her to new friends.
Then my mother went into a home to treat her dementia, she had a private room. We outfitted it with furnishings from her home. A favorite sitting chair, her TV, lamps and pictures she loved. Made it feel like her home.
I’d appreciate thoughts about the “moment” before. 

Because of safety issues (she got physical with me), we’re planning on bringing my wife directly from a hospital in San Diego to a memory care facility in phoenix. 

Any suggestions and experience on doing this and how to even prepare her without a big explosion?

Dementia,Friday Humor,"Caring for someone with dementia can be brutal.  Deeply frustrating for all parties.

Which is why we sometimes share whatever humor we can find, maybe dark, along the lines of laughing-so-we-don’t-cry (or scream, etc).","Last Saturday my mom was awakened by the staff at memory care for breakfast.

She called out from under the covers, “Is it a school day today?”  When the staff said, No, it’s the weekend my mom replied, “Good! Then I can stay in bed all day today!”

Ah, to be a teenager again.
My mom has become convinced there are two of me, and constantly asks me what the other me’s name is so that she can send her a thank you note. It’s sort of Avengers final movies level confusing to figure out which me she’s talking about. Finally my dad asked her “Well, one K is here, so we know who she is. What does the other K look like?”
And my mom replies, without missing a beat, “She looks a lot like this one, but much younger and with better highlights in her hair!” 😂
Thanks Mom…
An attempted light-hearted take on my daily thought process...

My mother: **""DID YOU TAKE CARE OF IT???""**

And nothing more, but she’s looking at my face intently.

So I…

* Ask her what she means.  Could make her more frustrated when she can’t verbalize it.

* Wait for her to explain what she means.  No pressure, but it could mean a few minutes of silence.  Followed, maybe, by her wondering what we were talking about... and, um, I can't help since I didn't know in the first place.

* Try to guess what she means.

* Try to remember her biggest concerns and bring them up one at a time to see if that’s what she means.  This of course runs the risk of getting her even more concerned about something else instead – an upcoming doctor’s appointment, or the idea of someone breaking into the house, or a neighbor’s kid who she thinks stays out too late (she's become a little too nosy looking out the window)…

* Tell her my wife took care of it.  (This should work unless she then asks my wife ""DID YOU TAKE CARE OF IT?!"" and my wife tells her I took care of it.)

* Pretend I didn’t hear her.

* Bluff.  “Yes, I took care of it!”, while surreptitiously sniffing for smoke...
My mom is in an independent living facility with a lot of support. She has a boyfriend (whose wife is in the memory care unit - maybe he has a type?)

Anyway last winter he complained to me that several times she called him at 5am, waking him, and asking him why he wasn’t there for cocktails. Being a good guy, he would dress and go over and indeed at 5am she had opened a bottle and set out two glasses and some snacks. 

I assume she thought she was waking up from an afternoon nap it was 5pm? In the winter it’s dark here at both 5am and 5pm.
My spouse has a piece of trivia that he shares with me almost daily. He first told this to me in the 80’s: “The Gunsmoke TV series plays somewhere in the world almost continuously.” 

This is not the kind of fact easily disproved so I always nod my head. Yesterday he said he heard about it recently. (Yeah, cuz you’re the one who said it!) 😂😂
My late grandmother was living with my Mom and Dad. One night she asked my Mom, “Doris, is your Dad still alive?”.  My Mom replied “No, Mom, he died 40 years ago”.  Grand mom said “Hmmm… took me that long to miss him”.  Now dealing with this with my dad.
Absolutely.

Dementia,My Mom was formally diagnosed with MCI.,"I decided to join this sub a little bit ago to start educating myself on Dementia, and to read about people’s experiences as care takers. My parents have done their due diligence in regularly getting tested for Alzheimer’s and as we had feared, my Mom’s (70yo) test results were not great this year. To be fair, they weren’t the worst-case scenario, but they were concerning.

After gently encouraging her to see a neurologist, they confirmed that she does have MCI. We think we might have gotten the diagnosis relatively early in her journey as she doesn’t currently have Dementia. My Dad, sibling and I are doing our best to learn more about MCI and Dementia, and reading up on ways to be compassionate care givers and humans to my Mom on this journey.

My parents are extremely responsible and have always been good about transparent communication with my sibling and I. Late last year we put together a Trust and designated myself and my sibling as the POA (financial and medical), outlined their DNR requirements and made a lot end-of-life plans. It was difficult and there’s more to be done, but knowing what they want and how to ensure they live the rest of their years with dignity and the most comfort possible has given me some comfort.

That said, I have been really scared about my Mom’s diagnosis. I can imagine she is too since one of her biggest fears was losing her memory the way her Mom (my grandmother) did. She’s strong despite her understandable fears. I just want to do what I can to support my Dad who will be her primary care taker and find ways to live her life to the fullest while she’s still very functional.

Thank you all for sharing your stories, your advice and recommendations, and for providing a safe space to talk about a really difficult thing.","My husband has MCI of the frontotemporal lobes. I think of MCI kind of like people who have pre-diabetes. Those people have the same things happening as people with diabetes except it’s just not as bad YET. The difference between pre-diabetes and MCI is that people with pre-diabetes can do something to reverse it and then be perfectly healthy again. With MCI there is nothing to be done except to wait for it to get bad enough to be considered dementia. 

The good news is that getting a diagnosis this early means plans can be made, items can be checked off the bucket list, and you and your family can learn as much as you can about what is to come. This sub has been great at helping me learn through their experiences. The bad news is that now you know what’s coming and the dread can envelop you. I spend my days cataloging the changes I see and wondering when he will be considered dementia. I have no idea why I do this, how to stop doing it, or even if I should try to stop it. It’s like watching a ticking bomb and trying to see if there are any changes to the shape, color, or sound of it to determine when it’s going to blow up.
Everyone has their own journey, but it seems one common experience is that those living with dementia truly experience life in the moment and connect to others through emotion. That can be pretty liberating.
There are some interesting biohacks for cognitive impairment including taking large doses of MCT oil (WARNING start slowly it's a laxative). The rationale is that the brain can't run on glucose anymore so you give it ketones instead. There's a TED talk on youtube about it.

Dementia,"I'm only 28, mom is 80, I'm overwhelmed","Sorry this could get long. Mostly a vent.

First post here. My mom is showing signs of dementia. She has been for a year or two now. She remembers who we are, who she is, her past, even her bank account numbers and things that have been the same for several years. But she often forgets where she is, how long she's lived in her apartment, the day/year, current events. She often forgets things she just said or things we just told her. She tries to write everything down but then loses her notepad she was writing in, so she scribbles all over anything within reach taking notes of every little thing. She has an appointment with her doctor soon to discuss everything and seek help.

Yesterday I became exponentially worried. She fell for a computer scammer. I had to leave work early to come help her reset all of her passwords and call her banks to make sure nothing was compromised. I spent six hours there in total, and tried my best to drill it into her the steps to take to avoid it. We agreed that leaving notes above her computer was a good idea so that she'd see them warning her and be able to stop it in its tracks if it happened again.

Well, today, not even 24 hours later, she did it again. She called me crying because she doesn't want me to remove her computer. She self isolates due to depression and doesn't have contact with the outside. She orders all her clothing and groceries on her computer and phone, but I would rather take them away than risk her losing what little financial independence she has left.

She lives in independent living right now and if she would just leave her room she'd be able to have church service, watch movies, have dinner, play games and more all in the same building! But she hasn't left in over two years because she's depressed, so instead she non stop orders things online and is living almost like a hoarder (not unsanitary though), and now falling victim to scammers left and right.

This isn't the first worrisome thing. A few weeks ago my husband, son, and I went to visit as a surprise and came into a smokey apartment because she'd left a pie in the over for who knows how long and it was black and burning in the oven. She had no idea because she forgot she put it in there and couldnt smell the burning or see the smoke. If we didn't show up she might have started a fire and the worst could have happened.

She's fought us left and right about taking away any iota of freedom. She's physically capable of caring for herself, she can bathe etc. But she gets confused and forgets extremely important things from one second to the next and even today she told me she doesn't know how to protect her from herself.

I don't know what to do. I'm barely 28, just got a good job, my son is under 10, I'm trying to go back to school and I'm so tired and overwhelmed. I don't know how to help her. I didn't sign up for this. Not to mention, the first 17 years of my life I had to watch my dad suffer through Parkinson's before he passed away at 81, so I know the horrors that can come next. Now it feels extra traumatic watching the only parent I really had with me during my whole life going through the early phases of memory loss too.

I've looked into memory care but I don't know if we could afford it, especially since she's still somewhat independent physically. We want to buy a house in the next year or two and have a special ADA suite added on for her so we can care for her and also utilize her LTC insurance to help. We don't want to just put her somewhere and let her rot away, we love her and are scared for her and just want the best.

Yes I was raised by my grandparents and no the rest of our family isn't in the picture. It's just me, my husband, and my son. We don't have any other support or resources. Thanks for letting me vent.

TLDR my mom is showing signs of dementia and is at risk of being scammed and I'm too young to be prepared to handle this and it all makes me very sad and scared and I don't know what to do.","Get your mom a pre-paid credit card to limit the damage she can do. If she hasn’t completed a health care proxy and financial power of attorney, make sure she does. This is going to get worse. The incident with the stove is most concerning here - she is losing safety awareness and shouldn’t be living alone.
You said she lives in independent living now. Is there a social worker or someone there that would have information on maybe a part time aid or similar? Can she stay in the independent living if she is diagnosed as having MCI or worse?
Your mum had you at 52?! That's incredible!  


Commentary aside, you should get financial power of attorney sorted out so you can protect her from being scammed. It will become more difficult to get as her condition progresses, so doing it sooner rather than later is very sensible. Think of it as one small thing you can do now that will make your life so much easier in future.
It’s time to take the computer away or heavily monitor her use - the scammers could wipe her out. 

Can you take her credit cards and banking info away and keep in a secure place? She will continue to order stuff online and is borderline hoarding because she likely forgets she’s already ordered things.  My mom kept renewing a magazine script over and over (the inserts) until I took over her finances.
May I suggest a “babysitter” visit for an hour a few times a week to assist her with online purchases and computer related things? A Local teenager girl (who is computer /iPhone savvy) would be ideal when you can’t be there to assist. Your mother’s local church may be able to suggest someone, or ask the local HS’s guidance teacher for a suggestion of an individual after school.

In HS I used to do this as part of an “adopt a grandmother” program in our area. I would read her the mail, or address birthday cards for her while we talked about our day. It was all volunteer, but a visitor can be compensated.
You mention that she is in independent living, and that you can't afford memory care.  Is there an in-between level that might work, such as assisted living?

Also, if you are going to take on this responsibility, you absolutely must have a power of attorney (POA) signed RIGHT NOW.  She cannot grant it if she is incompetent.  So if she gets worse, you would have to go to court to get it, even if she were willing and not opposing it.  

If she refuses to give you POA, then you should seriously think about stepping away.  I am in that situation personally, and it is an unbelievable nightmare.  There is nothing like being screamed at and accused of stealing by the person who is currently taking up all of your life with their needs.",2022-03-25 00:27:04,residenthrowawayy,tndzi9

Dementia,Dementia turned my loving grandpa into a rotten rude evil monster,"So my sister husband and I went to go visit my grandparents at their house in Florida last week and either my grandpa hates me and my sister or his dementia has gotten very bad. The first  two days were fine he was his happy loving self. But wow on the third day we were there WOW did he wake up on the wrong side of the bed. He told my sister and I that we were taking advantage of him. That we were disrupting his lifestyle.. and that we were never allowed back. For context we are in our 30s and have been visiting them for years. We had not visited in 3 years due to Covid/work and he had been asking my grandma why no one visits anymore… now I know why. My aunts and uncles had been mentioning that his dementia is bad he went on medicine and it seemed like it had subsided. My aunts no longer stay with him they get a hotel. My grandma loves for us to stay it keeps her company and we help with things around the house. The next day was fine he was joking with us saying too bad we weren’t staying for longer. Oh but the worst was yet to come the next morning. I woke up to him asking my grandma (they were outside in the patio outside my window). He asked if they had asked us to come see them or if we came on our own. My grandma replied that we had come to see them on our own (assuming that’s what he wanted to hear) oh wow did that set him off he barged into my sister’s room telling her that we were worthless, to get our things and get out, that we don’t help them with anything, we are “cheap”, that he told us not to come. Meanwhile we are always helping them be it cleaning, cooking computer needs etc. But wow he was RELENTLESS. He was even “apologizing” to my husband for our behavior right in front of us. Like a mean girl talking about someone in front of them. My poor grandma sits there and can’t say anything to him (they are old school like that) and she had not addressed the elephant in the room. I can see she is so tired. She tried to make plans for all of us but my grandpa “wanted to go home” and she would cancel. I know it is so hard for her, she talks to my mom about how he can get stern and other times doesn’t remember her. My mom even had my clean out my room at my parents house for her to stay when need be. Then when we left he did not remember me he looked at me like he had a totally blank stare and was trying to be polite. He did remember my sister and husband. Maybe because I heard the yelling that morning and hid from him all day. He was perfectly pleasant and said next time we’ll do this.. (meanwhile he was kicking us out a few hours before). It definitely hurt that he didn’t remember me, I think it may have clicked as I was out the door as he gave me a cheerful wave. This has never happened before and I can’t help to think these are subconscious thoughts… (don’t want that to sound empathetic I just kills me to hear that from my previously loving grandpa) but then again I haven’t been around him for an extended period of time in about three years. I wish I could understand where the rotten words were coming from… or if he’s at the “hallucinations” stage he thinks all of this because he can’t remember… Anyone have any insights?","All of that is from the dementia. The anger, the outbursts, paranoia, all of it. You have to realize that the “nasty” side of him is all the illness and are in no way subconscious thoughts. My Mom’s friend, her mother became a raging bigot, saying horrible things to black people. Her mother was part of the civil rights movement. She actually protested with Dr. King. It’s not them, it’s the disease. That’s the hardest part about dementia, losing them slowly while they slowly lose who they are and sometimes become someone else.
Sorry to hear this about your grandpa. Does he have bvFTD (Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia)?
I hear you. My dad was the gentlest person I'd ever known. Never raised his voice to anyone, much less raised a hand. The dementia turned him into a violent, psychotic maniac. He raged. He threatened and attacked us. He ranted about the most over-the-top insane conspiracy-theory type stuff. Just so, so far removed from the person I used to know, it was impossible to reconcile. And sometimes, like you, I wondered: was this what my dad was always like, and just hid it, or are our core personalities so fragile that a little swiss-cheese-brain can turn us into different people entirely? Neither idea is pleasant to contemplate. I just try to tell myself that it was the dementia talking, not my dad - basically, it killed my dad before he was dead, and the person who did and said all of those terrible, scary things was not him.",2022-03-24 22:30:07,MLDC618,tnbzhi
Dementia,Memory Care Keeps Sending Mom to the ER in the Middle of the Night. Is this normal?,"I'm hoping someone else out there has some experience with this. I placed my mom with (I'm guessing) about Stage Five/Six Alzheimer's in an Assisted Living facility back in September. In December, they moved her into Memory Care. In the six months that she's lived there, they've sent her to the emergency room in the middle of the night three times. For reasons that don't seem medically necessary:

Visit One: The facility staff said that she was wandering and they were afraid she was going to wander out of the building. (This was before the move to the locked Memory Care unit.)

Visit Two: She was found in another resident's room without clothes on. They actually didn't even tell me she was sent to the ER. I got a notification from the hospital's patient portal app. The facility refused to speak with me to explain what happened for about 24 hours. When I finally got a hold of someone, they claimed that she got aggressive when they tried to remove her from the other resident's room, and that's what triggered the ER visit. (Turns out, she had a UTI.)

Visit Three: This one happened tonight. There's a stomach bug going around the facility. My mom was sick and threw up. Supposedly, my mom asked about going to the hospital. I talked to the head nurse, and we decided mom would NOT go to the ER. (If she was still stick tomorrow, I'd take her to urgent care.) Less than two hours later, I get a notification from the patient portal app indicating that my mom's in the ER. Then the facility night shift med tech called me after that. I'll admit, I went off on them a little bit. The first med tech I talked to claimed that my mom was threatening to hit herself, and that's why they sent her. The second med tech said nothing about behavioral issues and said they just sent her because she was sick and that they sent ALL the sick residents with the stomach bug to the ER. She also said that if my mom says she wants to go to the hospital -- despite having Alzheimer's and me saying no -- they HAVE to send her.

From the early test results, seems like she has a UTI now too.

Is this normal? Do other memory care facilities frequently send residents to the ER for reasons that are not medical emergencies?

The facility she's in is private pay. But these hospital bills are starting to add up. I just got the bill for the ambulance ride from Visit Two. It's $700! Plus all the tests and x-rays and whatnot. Each visit probably costs more than $1,000 even after insurance. We just can't do this every other month. 

Maybe it's cruel to even be mentioning money, but I just don't know how long she'll need care and don't want to burn through her savings.

And sending a woman with Alzheimer's to the ER all by herself seems cruel. On top of this, after the first two ER visits, I noticed a drop in cognition that she never quite 100% recovered from.

This is supposedly the best facility in the area. And I'm worried and angry, but also afraid that my being difficult will end up getting my mom labeled a problem resident or something. Does anyone have any advice??","Not being a medical professional, I can't speak to the medical need of these visits.  But the fact that they did not immediately contact you when they did so is a problem.  As is their stonewalling with regards to visit number 2.  It sounds like this facility is doing what is easiest for them not what is in the best interests of the patient and the patients family.  If you have the resources, you may want to see if there is a better place for your mom.
Hi, I have worked in multiple memory cares for the past 3 years. In my time, we very rarely send out residents unless it is a legitimate emergency. That includes for behavioral situations as well such as the wandering into other's rooms. 

My suggestion is to talk with the facilities administrator and tell them that you want to be called first and foremost. Every facility I have worked at has had that as a rule, unless someone was clearly having a stroke/heart attack.

In my opinion, it sounds like the memory care there sucks. There might be a lot of new staff who do not know much about dementia which is really unfortunate.

If you are thinking about having her transferred to a different memory care, I suggest reading the glass door reviews. If it states that there is a high turn over rate, I would not go with that one. 

Tldr; talk to the administrator and research other facilities.
This is totally normal and I hate it.  My memory care facility sends my dad to the ER if he yells.  Last night he wandered into someone’s room and the staff tried to get him out I guess my dad yelled at them.  They were ready to send him to the ER luckily they called me I went down to the facility at 10 pm and talked my dad down and had them give meds to calm him.  This is a monthly occurrence and I told the head nurse no more ER I will come down whenever they need me.  Each trip to the ER cost my father close to $1k with the ambulance rides and copay’s.  I feel like the memory care facilities this is my dads second one do the bare minimum they need to do to stay out of trouble.  My dad pays $10k a month and they call me at least once a week about different things I’m sick of it.
I think I'd be talking to the admin and looking for another memory care, if that's possible. My mom would've ""loved"" to have been taken to the ER all the time. She always had a thing for all things medical and getting a doctor to pay attention to her was like a trip to Disney for her and that never went away. Thankfully, her memory care had a doctor on call that could deal with most minor issues. There were a couple of ""yellers"" in the unit who smacked and bit staff that got too close. Even they weren't sent out until the issue had been going on for a while. A few days either in the hospital's psych ward or a couple of weeks in the state facility would get their meds leveled out and they'd be right back until they needed another reset.  In the 9 months Mom was in memory care she was only taken to the ER once and that was when she had pneumonia. Even then, they sent her back to the facility to stay because the ER was disorienting and staying in the hospital would've been worse. Maybe they're just too short-staffed to deal with anything right now?
Those UTI’s really mess up the Dementia. My mom gets them 4 to 5 times a year and when she does, I always had to take her to the ER. She would soil herself and wander and  become so confused and could not follow simple orders. But now, after she’s had Covid, UTI and a small stroke on top of that, she is bed-bound and on a feeding tube. She’s been home for a few weeks after being in hospital/rehab since Christmas. I wouldn’t even know if she had a UTI now (I guess if she ran a fever). We have a  home health aide Mon to Fri 8-5. On weekends we are in our own. Thankfully, we got her on Medicaid so an ER visit would be covered. She’s on a lot of anti-depressants and seizure meds. Also a med for her cyrhossis (which also mentally messes u up),
The first two seem normal to me (my MIL is mid stage Alzheimer’s in independent (with lots of assistance) living), she was sent to ER after being physically aggressive with staff and held in hospital for over a week to reassess medications. We were notified by hospital about 12 hours after she left her home (6 hour wait in ambulance, 6 hours to be given a bed). I agree it’s cruel to do this to someone with dementia. 

Not sure what the third visit was about, certainly threats of self harm never get my MIL sent (very common for her) perhaps her UTI was making her a bit erratic. We live in Canada, so I sympathize more with the drop in cognition more than the cost which is awful. We’re burning through my MIL’s savings so quickly. I keep telling myself that she should use it while she’s somewhat with it, but we’ll see how it goes. Talking about the cost is realistic and necessary, it’s not about valuing the money over your parent - it’s needing to be able to support them as long as you need to.
Really tough situation. If this were my mum I’d be upset as well about any ER visits. They’re brutal for someone in your mum’s situation and it definitely sucks to have to work as hard as you are to find out what’s happening each time. 

My advice if you want to help your mum is do everything you can not to take out your frustrations on the staff. Yes, some of them deserve it, but rarely are the ones to hear it unfortunately. 

Your mum is my favourite kind of patient, hence with I’m a older adult mental health nurse. If the facility she is in aren’t able to handle her behaviours then have you got the option to move her? If not, I’d recommend consulting a psychiatrist who specialises In older adults.

If your mum is hurting herself or others this will be a huge deal unfortunately. Not fair for your mum because it’s such a normal symptom.
(I'm in the U.S., so my response is based on what's typical here.) 

After they make the call for the ambulance, they should be calling the healthcare POA (you, I presume) to inform you of the situation. Then you can drive to the hospital and meet her there so she won't be alone.  This is one major reason the healthcare POA should live close to the patient. 

Behavior changes that turn out to be UTIs are a very common reason for MC patients to wind up in the ER.  And it's not uncommon for it to happen repeatedly. Unless she's on hospice, and you have written agreements with the facility that she is never to be sent to the hospital, then they have a responsibility to send her to the ER if they feel it's warranted.  There are liability issues here.

Do they do UTI testing (including culture) at the facility? If it's positive, can they quickly get her the appropriate antibiotics (specific to what shows on the culture) prescribed and filled by using their in-house MD?  If the answer to either of the questions is No, then the ER visit is definitely warranted. You might interview some skilled nursing facilities (rather than non-nursing memory care facilities) to see how they would handle behavior changes/suspected UTI.",2022-03-24 21:55:11,notagainjanet,tnbc5l
Dementia,One Week,"My dad had a TBI in 2020 that jump started his dementia. I've worked with mental illness and been around elderly my whole life. My sister is a CNA and has been my father's primary care giver since his fall. 

I live 1100 miles away. 3-4 times a year I come to spend a week with my parents and give my sister a break. I also make sure they have all the supplies they need and any adaptive equipment that might be helpful. It's not much and I have a ton of guilt, but I do what I can without giving up my whole life. 

I go home tomorrow and I am exhausted. I don't know how my sister does it. By far the most frustrating aspect of my father's condition is his unwillingness to complete his personal hygiene. And by that I mean not yell at me while I'm cleaning him or to let me help him to the bathroom instead of sitting with a soaked bottom. 

I can handle the crazy talk. I can deal with the same questions 100 times a day. I'm ok with the inability to hold a conversation with what used to be a very intelligent man. But if anyone would've told me that he would refuse to shower or even go to the toilet most of the time, I wouldn't believe them. 

My father was always meticulous with his personal hygiene and dress. The man had heart surgery and insisted we take his dirty clothes out on a hanger in a garmet bag so they wouldn't get wrinkled. He ironed his undershirts. 

The memory aspect I'm ok with. I accept that the next time I'm here he might not know me. I just wish he would let us care for him and keep him clean without a fight. Any words of wisdom on this subject would be appreciated, but I really just needed to commiserate. 

My respect to those of you who do this day in and day out.  You are the kind of people who give me hope in humanity.","Ah, another drive-by son having difficulty coping with his short stint as a caregiver. Go commiserate with your sister. Wait, that doesn’t work? I wonder why.
I really feel for you and your sister having to deal with that. I’m in the same boat with my wife. She was so meticulously clean in her non-dementia condition, and I can’t stand for her to be wet or dirty.  My comments to her are “ the doc says we gotta get you changed right away so you don’t get sick”, or something similar. Sometimes she buys it, sometimes she says “that’s bullshit”. I’ve been hit, scratched, kicked, hair pulled and yelled at during changes, but it’s gotten better. I have lighting-quick reflexes around her now.",2022-03-24 21:49:54,Mo-ree,tnb8jy
Dementia,i am the bad guy,"So, mom's in late 70's and has dementia. Bro and I took care of her in her own home for about 4 months. It was awful for my family to have me MIA several days a week suddenly. I work full time,  have 4 kids -- 3 in HS and 1 started  college, husband works 60+ hours a week,  very busy, so not able to pick up much slack for me at home.  Bro has no kids and lives 40 mins away I live 20 mins away.  Bro owns mom's house and has high paying paying gig work and lovely, successful wife. 
Bro moved mom into his home to sell her home. He likes arrangement  and mom seems to be doing well. I was not part of planning. I  am  expected to cover 1 or 2 days of weekend. I can't take it. I am fried with my work/family and now my two days off are committed to caretaking or squeezing all housework/parenting into 1 day on weekend. The kicker? Mom favored bro and had issues with me (even bro admits she has issues with women but thinks i should overlook this).  Bro wants to do caretaking  and I don't think i can do it.  Do I have options?","If you can't commit to an entire day or weekend of care, could you make an effort to get your mum out of the house and doing something once per week? A movie, a walk/picnic at the park, some hobby she enjoys?  


I asked my brother for this because it would give me a couple hours to not only feel sane, but to clean up my dad's room and bathroom without him blowing a fuse over me doing so. So far brother hasn't even tried to do this even once, but it would be something I'd have personally appreciated. A lot.
If you don't think you can do it say so. It's hard. My wife and I have been living with it almost 4 years now with her mother. If you can't make it a pleasant environment, let them know.
Stop, just stop. I am the sole caregiver for my 92 year old Mom with dementia. We’re in Florida and my sister is in Montana. Now Mom and I made the decision for this and my sister agreed after the fact. I absolutely do not expect and help from her. Mom and I made these plans before she was even diagnosed.

Your brother and your Mom made their plans and didn’t include you in any of them. Now your brother is issuing orders to you. The answer is “No.” You don’t have the emotional, mental or physical resources to do it. If he wants a break have him take your Mom to a doctor and have part time home health ordered. They made their plans, now they need to deal with it. You have a family and you need to prioritize them.

Get a good book on boundaries. Because a lot of the hassles I was getting was from church members I like

My therapist recommended them. Look your not going to be any good to anyone if you drive yourself into a break down or the grave. Your brother made all these decisions, not you, he needs to deal with them. Your just not up to it.
Your doing the best you can, and I'm so amazed that you managed to have a full time job all while taking care of someone at home. It's difficult and I understand the anxiety if having someone else take care of a loved one, but you also need to look after yourself. You have kids and while they arent so young anymore that doesn't mean they don't need your support. Take this from a teenager in HS who has to care of their mother and constantly has to witness their father distressed and declining in mental health from the stress. Please, even if your kids aren't the ones looking after her they are probably guilty they can't  help or are silently suffering watching you. I dont mean to guilt trip you, but I want you to see this from a different perspective. Look after yourself and remember its okay to take breaks.

Sounds like you are the scapegoat and Bro is the golden child.  
Welcome to my life. And there are seven of us, each with our own life.
Beating yourself doesn’t solve anything. Judging yourself gets you nowhere accept at Regrets doorstep. There is no right or wrong way. If the situation was reversed and you were in a position like your brother, it seems like you would be willing to bear the brunt. It seems to me that boundaries need to be set and maybe both of you need to make decisions together vs. him feeling like he has all the power and delegating to you. It sucks all the way around. There is no right answer. Guilt is IMO a useless emotion and puts you in a position to make bad decisions . Let that shit go. Make peace with yourself and decide what you can do today. Things change, maybe one day you can do more maybe less. The point it you are doing something. I know it’s hard to be kind to yourself, but it will pay dividends going forward. Dementia touches everyone involved. I send you a virtual hug.
It sounds like you have a whole lot on your plate.  Is it possible for you to hire an aid for the weekends?  If not is it possible to have an honest talk with your brother and just lay it all out and promise to do as much as you can right now.  He doesn't seem to understand your life as it is so different from his.  Don't cave in, you need to take care of you and your family.
Don't feel bad! at the end of the day you're not a nurse and you're not trained in memory care. You're doing the best you can but in all honesty she needs specialized care and suggesting assisted living where she will get more support doesn't make you selfish or a bad person. You have to think about her safety as well.
What types of things do you do on your days off? Are there any than can be done with your LO alongside? Or at her place with her? Watch a TV show, bring over lunch, read to her...?

Your kids aren't little either... I've raised three myself. At those ages, there really isn't that much intensive hands on parenting to be done! They can spare you a few hours twice a week. Unless there is something wrong with them developmentally, they could also take a few hours to entertain their grandmother at their uncles house, right? 

Seems like modeling for your kids that family is important would certainly mean you and kids could spend at least a few hours every weekend during the last few year/months of her life. 

I know this comes off as guilting you and I don't know ANYTHING about you or your family dynamics. However, it seems you already feel guilty and just want strangers here to make you feel better about your decision to not help. If you don't want to help, be a grown up and own that. You may not have had a great relationship with her but it doesn't have to stay that way. Do your kids dislike her too? This is a chance to change things if you want to.

This IS hard and I don't ever fault someone for knowing their own limits. I wish you good luck with whatever you decide to do.",2022-03-24 21:28:19,Puzzleheaded-Sir9505,tnauci
Dementia,Mom tried to use our gas stove today,"She hasn't tried to use it in years, but today, I caught her trying. 

So this is another level of stress I don't need. lol (If I don't laugh I'll cry)","Get some of those child proof things to put on the knobs…

I was just telling my mom that my grandmaw wouldn’t try to cook and then i see this 😂
We remove the knobs off the stove at night when it’s our turn to care for my MIL- our learning curve was when we woke up to blackened crumbs in a pan that she used during the night. Don’t know what it was but I’m thankful she didn’t ignite herself or our home (we have a gas stove). We also put child latches on the refrigerator. NEVER (and I mean NEVER!) a dull moment!
Before my Dad passed away last month, he would wander into the garage late at night.  I installed a new door lock with a keypad.  He always asked for the 4 digit code and would get mad when it never worked for him.  Then his dementia would kick in and he’d forget the code and the loop would start again.
Our gas stove has a cutoff valve. If you have that, it would be a good idea to shut it too, along with doing something to the knobs.  A second line of defense.",2022-03-24 18:50:07,PowertothePixie,tn7rp9
Dementia,MIL Started Calling From Care Facility,"My MIL has had a very rough couple of months. She lost her husband, moved across the country to be closer to my wife and our family. 

As you would expect, she is very confused, scared, and agitated at times. We just got her a phone in her room (not sure if that was a good or bad idea), but she was using the facilities phone prior. 

It's difficult to pick up the phone when she calls because we'll have to tell her again (and again) that her car isn't out front, she's not going home, etc. It's extremely taxing for my wife when they have the same conversation over and over. 

Have others experienced the same, and how did you deal with it? Also, is giving her a phone a bad idea?","She's further along than my loved one so this may not be worth much, but I would (compassionately) lie to her and tell her she'll be picked up tomorrow
My father calls me and other immediate family a lot.  If it's getting excessive we stop answering and they do unplug the line at bedtime.  It sounds like she's been through the mill, try to be patient, especially your wife.  Don't cut off her phone.  Watch the times that she's calling and her mood, if she's sundowning that might be the time not to answer.  You can take calls too and tell her your wife's not home, but you'll ask as soon as she gets in.  Or you're just waiting to hear from the doctor etc..  Make sure she's got her own TV too, it's a necessary distraction.

My father's in a 'good' home and we've had lots of issues with his care.  Let me tell you the staff knows exactly who's getting visitors and who isn't, who has a communication line and who doesn't, who's on top of things and more.  It definitely effects how they're cared for.  Keep an eye out for her.
My dad did this too. If I didn't answer, he called repeatedly thinking HE was making a mistake dialing. Usually I answered. When questions about stuff came up, I told him lies. I told them to him in a normal, conversational tone and always kindly cheerful. He would worry because he couldn't find his keys. If I had given him a fake set, he would have tried to get in his truck to go home so I told him he gave me the keys to drive the truck in for an oil change. 

Often though, I felt like I couldn't take it emotionally so I changed my outgoing voice-mail message. It said ""Hi Dad, whatcha doin'!?"" as was the way I always answered. He would just talk about stuff and eventually hang up lol. 

He is now pretty much past using the phone :( although he remembers how to talk on it if someone dials and hands it to him. We don't call because if it rings, it stresses him out because he can't figure out how to answer it. I got him a ""dementia phone"" from RAZ Mobility...look into that! It's awesome and VERY useful/easy. 

I am lucky to stay about 5 min drive from his facility so I pop in ALL the time randomly; any visits you can make are an investment in her level of care. Some CNAs (the ones with the MOST contact with your lo) really do not care and will only do ""the letter of the law"" type if care...not thinking of the person as an actual person, more like a box to be checked of the to-do list of their shift. Other CNAs really do a GREAT job and spend their spare minutes chatting with the lo or doing little caring things like checking if they need help eating their meal etc. I try to randomly take treats to the whole floor where dad is... sometimes cookies from Walmart even, a note etc...

I also made my dad a poster with photos and details about my dad as a person. Not for him to see, just so the aides and staff could see him as a real person with a former life and people that love him. I still get people telling me how cool it is for them to know about him. The CNAs are often from staffing agencies so there is a lot of inconsistency about who cares for him from shift to shift, even day to day. It gives ME dementia trying to keep track LOL!!

Good luck, stay light and humorous when you can. Pay attention!! These days are HARD, but they really are the last days we get with them. We don't know how many so try not to get bogged down in the details. If it's not going to kill them in the moment, let the small things go... Facility lose another white undershirt? Cool, they are cheap at the thrift store to replace. Only ate dessert for dinner? Who cares! Repeats a story with nonsense words? Just hold hands, smile over and over, and agree. 

When you just cant... go scream in the car till you feel better. Cry, lay in the bed and binge a TV show, go for a run, get hammered, join a FB or Reddit forum (lol), etc. Just get back at it when you can, as soon as you can :) 

I have been using a voice recorder app on my phone when I'm with my dad. I have HOURS of conversations to reminisce with later if I decide to. It gives me comfort knowing his voice will be there and I won't forget when he was cracking some kind of dementia joke, or telling me he loves me too, or thoughts he has. 

Tangentially, it also helps me moderate my own emotions around him. I've never been mad at him so far but knowing I would be on tape if I did say mean stuff might keep me from it. It also helps me feel if any of my crappy relatives ever doubt me if I tell them what Dad told me, I have a date-stamped backup LOL. I will NEVER tell them tho until after he dies, if even then. He's the only one left of my family (besides my kids) that I love :(

Anyway, enough of the dark stuff :) Sending you much love and reach out anytime...
I wouldn't definitively say she'll be picked up tomorrow, but that's just me. My mom was really bad about somehow remembering really definitive things. We often would tell her when she demanded answers that she was there for rehab and when she got better she could leave, but until the doctor said she could go, she needed to stay.
I have a white board up in my mothers room that I write things on she needs to remember.

Right now it says “This is your home”.  I’ll bet you can guess why. I’m also working on a sign that says “Free Toilet” for her bathroom.  Bet you can’t guess that one either.

You may need to figure out what to write so it doesn’t upset her, maybe a white lie like a previous poster suggested.
When we moved my mom to memory care, the director counseled against letting my mom have a phone in her room.  Based on his experience, some MC residents occasionally called 911.  A cell phone was out of the question because it would inevitably get lost.",2022-03-24 14:22:04,Bcruz75,tmtej2

Mom had to take one of the dogs to the vet, right after she left I heard my grandma head towards the laundry room (she struggles with walking but refuses to use her walker so I worry about falls) - I came in and said “please just leave the laundry for now”. She really can’t work the machine anymore and I don’t expect her to but of course I don’t say that.

She got very upset and her reaction was a mix of shutting herself in her bedroom but also telling me I’m going to end up alone, I can’t even take care of myself so I shouldn’t try to take care of her, she’s going to move out, etc.

I know it’s the disease (I have a bit of a healthcare background as well) but it really hurt. It’s like she somehow knew what to say that would hurt me most. I tried to explain that I was washing the laundry in hot water because she’s been sick and I want to get everything really clean but no luck. She just kept repeating insults.

My mom and I don’t have a lot of help or people to talk to about being caregivers and I just needed somewhere to vent. Thanks for listening.

Edit: Thank you everyone! She later apologized so I’m not sure if she became more aware of what she said or how harsh some of it was, if this happens in early stages, etc. But I’ve read each comment and I appreciate it. It’s just a bit difficult to reply right now.","It can be very tough in the moment because we are not used to people attacking us like that. You want to keep them safe because they are forgetting how things work and also you are doing so much that if you let them help it just means you have to do it over again taking twice as long. My dad would always try to cook without cookware, just putting plates on the stove. Try to tell him that's not safe and I get the ""I don't know what I'm talking about, I'm 50 years older I know things..."". Work around solution was to shut the circuit off to the stove. And from their perspective, they are having trouble doing things that were once so easy and it is probably very frustrating.  One thing that works great is tone. Try not to respond with anger or harshly. A plate's been broken - get mad and be like what the hell! or - Are you Ok? That could have been dangerous, let me take care of it...  Redirecting is also great. Grandma wants to do laundry, say there are some towels you want to add after a shower so laundry will be later. As things progress, the sound of your voice will be something they recognize as other things are forgotten.
Sending you a big hug! I'm so sorry you're going through this. She doesn't mean it. My dad has said some hurtful things I know he would never have said prior to his mental decline. I know he doesn't mean it. He's lashing out because he is scared and confused. And who is this person who thinks she can boss me around?

 Can I offer some tips? 
1. Grandma is never wrong. Offer corrections but try not to say no. Instead of saying Dad, it is gross and ridiculous to try to pick up dog poo in the back yard with an empty gallon milk carton (true story)... Run and get supplies for him. Dad, thank you for doing that! This would be a lot easier if you put the poo in this shopping bag though, huh? Good job! Let me put that in the trash for you! Daisy really appreciates you helping clean up after her! Can you hear the tone of my voice? Tone is so important. It can completely change his mood.
2. Find activities for her. Busy work is your friend. Grandma, could you please help us with XYZ? She'll feel needed and won't get stuck in the endless loop of not knowing what she should be doing.
3. Don't ask her questions. You may know this one already but asking questions leads to more confusion and lashing out. She's not going to remember I she took her pills, if she ate, where she put her purse, etc and it just upsets her because she probably knows enough to know she should remember.
I'm sorry she lashed out like that. You are taking good are of her, that is love in action.
My grandma says mean things too. She’s also gotten physical. They tend to get angriest at the people closest to them. I just give her a Xanax now. My peace of mind has grown ten fold.
It's a journey that we are not trained to walk. Seek support, from Reddit, family, professionals, all of the above. I am a behavioral therapist and have worked with people with all kinds of disabilities. I still needed help providing care for my aging parents, which included physical needs post stroke and dementia.  Hugs and peace.",2022-03-24 10:36:43,overstimulatedx0,tmebay
Dementia,Did anyone pull their loved one out of a facility because you were disappointed in the quality of the over-priced care and NOT regret it.,,"Not quite, but similar.

Dad, 95+, a widower, terminal renal failure, dialysis no longer effective after 10 years. Brainfog, chronic pain, contemplating ending dialysis, painless death within a week or so. Complications just before Covid rolled in, he was in the hospital for one crisis or another *every* week.

Time for hospice in home, me as solo caregiver. Had to ""park"" him in intensive care wing of independent living complex so I could catch a week's respite at my own home 1000+ miles away. Big $$$, but I was about to crack with constant caregiving, my partner back home having mental health crisis.

Came back from respite week. This $$$ place had let dad sit in shitty drawers for the week I was gone; ""you didn't tell/pay us to do laundry."" (I had packed enough underwear, but accidents happened.)

Home hospice choice: (a) put him in the shitty-drawers unit so he could have IV palliative meds. (Legal issues, I'm not authorized to give IV meds.) Or (b) give tiny morphine & benzo doses orally at 2 hour intervals day & night for duration of hospice, meaning no sleep for me for days. 

I didn't sleep more than an hour at a time until he died. Didn't want shitty-drawers place to have any part in his death, didn't want them to override my judgment or standard of care. No regrets. 

Fuck the shitty-drawers unit.
Kind of but ideally you’d want to outsource all the personal care and general babysitting. It only worked for us because i was already unemployed and got extra/extended UI due to covid. which was why we pulled her out of assisted living in 2020.  It still ruined my mental health though and relationships lol

It was so much work trying to coordinate actual care from outside not being allowed to visit due to COVID. They canceled pedicures and did pre- auth by GP before monthly podiatrist visits…still never got her toenails cut in 6 months it was painful :( She felt like she was in solitary while still paying $6000 a month burning through her LTC money. However we did use the fact she was in assisted living to clear out her hoard at home. So she had less furniture, clutter and enough space to actually turn around with her rollator inside the home. 

At some point she progressed from mid to mid-late but that’s impossible to say whether it was prompted by her age (88), isolation/no socializing/activities due to covid, or the fact that she didn’t use hearing aids, or the change in scenery. And shortly after she came home, she started finding new and innovative ways to injure herself.

also we had two apartments in the same low-rise building so I had my own space distinct from hers, and a baby monitor so that we could run down if she yelled for help or we overheard her trying to run away. (we didn’t “lock her in” but she tried to go out for weird things at weird times, like “to the bank” late at night barefoot in the snow 🥴). 

Ultimately she was at home only 1.5 years total between the time she came out of assisted living and when she died. Her second hip break in October 2021 meant she was in rehab for six weeks and never really bounced back. We put her on hospice (struggled with getting a referral letter from the dr office due to christmas). She couldn’t walk alone at all, and slept more. It was more physical labor helping her stand up to use the toilet and rinse (had a washlet bidet) and eventually to change her diaper in bed. but it was less stressful because she wasn’t constantly finding new ways to get into trouble. We had my mom (in her 60s) me and my brother both unemployed recent college grads helping towards the end. It would not have been doable by a single person. she died at home in early March 2022.
My sister moved my mom out of her house into a place in Oregon. No one spoke Spanish there (my mom has lost a lot of her English) and I live in Mexico so as soon as I could (3 months, I'd just had surgery the week she went in) I moved her in with me. She never remembered my teenaged kids and got spooked every time she ran into them at home so we moved her into her own 1 bedroom apt. and hired companion caregivers 24/7. When she needs medically trained care, not sure what we'll do. It's half the cost and 100% private, gotta love Mexico. It took another  3 months to get all the care lined up, I didn't sleep, paid for it in health problems myself but it's all good now. There are excellent care homes here including for expats, when the time comes I'm confident we'll find a good place for her but while she knows us might as well have her nearby.
Kinda. Grandma actually got herself kicked out of all the good facilities and we ended up having her put into a questionable place. She had a mouth on her and would slap the nurses. We had just bought a house and we’re converting a space for her to be with us. Nobody trusted the facility and so we all took turns visiting her to make sure she was okay. They were just neglectful, overworked and underpaid staff, and anyone could tell just by walking in there. We ended up pulling her out as soon as we could and she passed at home a few years later. Different times, can’t even imagine how we would be able to do that now.

Edit: She was mean to us too, but as time went on she calmed down considerably. Still had a mouth though.
Thank you for sharing your story. Sending love and healing from what sounds like a very tough time caring for your mom in her last years.
My mother went to rehab which i resolved would only be for a month, for physical therapy after a stroke. The night aide tried to give my mom meds and she refused and the aide angrily threw her medication in the garbage. I complained and they assured me it wouldn’t happen again and then my mother got another stroke. She went back to the hospital and I took her straight home where she has aides.

I never wanted to take my mom to a rehab center (let’s not mince words it was a nursing home), but the doctors were very persistent and told me it was the best thing for her. It’s one of my biggest regrets in life. That place was absolutely horrible and all the places with good reputations are always full.
I busted my dad out due to poor care and the negative effect on my mom. She had dementia and missed him terribly, was confused and sad.  It was a challenge but with hospice support for my dad, I managed. I am grateful that I could give my parents a higher quality of life. They have since both passed away.",2022-03-24 09:30:43,Road_to_independence,tma9np
Dementia,What are the next steps?,"My grandmother is in her 90s and had rapid mental decline the past two years. She’s in palliative care right now. As of a week ago she could sort of follow a conversation, knew who I was, and so on. The past two days she hasn’t been able to make a lucid response to anything I say. Tonight she’s talking nonstop to nobody in particular, sometimes calling out for her mother, sometimes talking to people who aren’t here. I can’t get her to respond enough to me to get her to eat or drink. What other progression is typical? I’m trying to prepare myself for what I know is coming, but I wasn’t expecting her to be so non responsive to me; it’s like I’m not here at all and it’s heartbreaking trying to get her to eat. 

Health wise she’s dealing with a lot of pain from arthritis but otherwise she isn’t facing any organ failure that I know of - aside from what I know is on the way because she’s simply not eating enough to sustain herself. 

Any advice or insight would be welcome. I know what’s just around the corner and I’m not ready for it yet.","That sounds like what I have with my mother right now. I've just recently stumbled across the red light therapy discussions and studies publications concerning positive reports on symptom reduction of dementia sufferers and other brain issues...injuries and Parkinson's, etc when treated with red and near-infrared light. Sometimes I see the word ""regeneration"" used. I'll be ordering a device in the next day or so.
Have you heard of this approach?",2022-03-23 20:28:05,SaulWellandGood,tlodo6
Dementia,Are there any apps for dementia patients or their caregivers?,"Title is pretty self explanatory, it could be for Android or iOS, the more suggestions the better, and thank you in advance.   


If you use it and could describe why and how it helps you, that would also be much appreciated. What are the features you like and what features did you wish it had?  


Thank you!","This gets asked a lot. Dementia patients, once they're more advanced, aren't going to remember how to launch, let alone use an app. As for caregivers, there are a ton of reminder apps and apps to help destress, so I don't know exactly what an app could do.
It's not really just an app but Wyze cameras are really affordable and have been a huge help. You can use them to check on your LO through video and audio monitoring, speak to them through app, set it to notify you when it detects movement in certain areas, etc.

Another useful tool to manage caregiver stress is just a simple timer that goes off 2-3 times a day (or as many times as you need it) that reminds you to take 5 nice slow breathes, preferably where the exhale is longer than the inhale. I know it seems silly but research has shown that most caregivers have elevated cortisol levels (stress hormone) and this practice alone drastically reduced them!

I haven't used them personally as my LO has never been too technologically inclined but I've heard *Alz Life* and *RecallCue Dementia Day Clock* can be helpful.",2022-03-23 15:13:02,No_Werewolf_6517,tl8rq2
Dementia,Having trouble staying in touch with Dad.,"Dad has had noticeable MCI for several years, recently got a diagnosis of Alzheimer's / dementia, and was reported to the DMV by his neurologist. He has a wonderful girlfriend that basically lives with him and has been helping to organize his affairs as he experiences challenges. She now wants to recuse herself from everything, feeling (understandably) that it's not her place. 
The problem is that I live several states away, and my only sibling has zero desire or ability to be helpful in any way.

Dad misplaces his phone every 20 minutes. Even when he's holding it, he does not notice when I call, he can't respond to texts, does not check email... It is a source of frustration for me as I try to manage his financial affairs, medical affairs, will / trust, driving situation, etc. from afar.

I thought it might be helpful if he has an Apple watch or fitbit or something that will alert him by vibration or sound if he gets a text or call, and can be used to set a daily alert to check his email from his computer. He is willing to try to learn how to use it. Cost is not really a consideration.

Does anyone have knowledge / experience / ideas about devices that may aid in this situation?","Tactfully it’s not gonna work. Our dad died from dementia and using his cell phone was one of the first things to go. He also gave out his ssn over the phone and got conned into ordering stuff. 
Gently, this might be the time to start making long term plans. We decided when daddy got to the point he couldn’t live alone, we would move in with him on a rotation basis, to keep at home. We just didn’t know when to start. We had a bad winter lotta snow lotta freezing temperature. He locked himself outside, a neighbor saw him pried open the screen door and called me. 
Something like this could happen to your dad. Tactfully and respectfully, the future maybe now
I know the deaf have blinking lights in the house for door bell and phone ringing. Perhaps look into that.

Tbh, if your Dad can’t handle his phone’s basic features, programming or understanding an Apple Watch’s functionality may be a mountain to high to climb. 

My husband is 59 with signs of dementia (Parkinson’s) that we are having assessed.  He used to be a high-level computer programmer and mathematician, he now can’t learn new “skills” or navigate apps or text messaging. He misplaced his wallet and phone frequently, even with a set established location for both.
Even though your dad says he wants to give it a shot, it would probably be impossible for him to learn how to use it. Unless his current phone is silenced, he's already not reacting to hearing it ring, and who could say if he'd be able to connect the vibration to its meaning and act on it. It seems like he could also just take it off? Trying to learn new things and ultimately failing at them can also be especially hard emotionally for a person who has dementia. They can actually sometimes remember that feeling of failure long after they can remember what brought it on.

My mom sounds similar to your dad and she goes through periods of ""organizing"" (misplacing important items). Often people who have dementia hide things that they know are important because they have some sense that they keep losing them (or specifically that those items keep getting ""stolen"" since they have no explanation for why they're missing) and want to keep them secure. I strongly recommend the book ""The 36-Hour Day"" if you haven't read it. It's really helped me better understand what my mom is going through and how to help her. I also recommend contacting your dad's local Alzheimer's Association chapter and area agency on aging for assistance. 

Sorry that I do not have any recommendations for your original question! Good luck.
My parents tried the Apple watch for Mom. She couldn't learn how to use it.

She had been really good at that kind of stuff, but it just wasn't going to happen anymore.

I got Dad a different communication device (GrandPad) when I had to shut off his phone (he had 3 car warranties and no car, and called the mayor of the town he used to live in for a ride home from memory care, among lots and lots of other phone adventures) and he eventually was able to use it part of the time. It took months. His biggest problem is that he wants to have it with him 24/7 so the battery is usually dead.

The general problem, though, is that when the existing tech becomes too hard to use, learning new tech - no matter how much simpler it is - is usually not possible.
Landline. No voicemail/answering machine. Call until he answers.
I was in your position before I ended up moving in - but while I was still away, a Blink home camera system was a lifesaver. 

I was VERY reluctant to use it since the video seems to invasive. However - we use it mainly as a walkie talkie and works fabulously (plus you can set up as many as you want).

The other nifty thing was setting it up for “at home” vs away mode … this was critical for not eating up moms autonomy (she can leave do whatever she wants without me checking up), but alerts you when they get back home. 

My mom goes through ‘loops’ where she forgets what the cell phone was / is or confused it with a notebook (so the thought of using it for communication goes out the window at times).

Oh and I lived about 30 miles away at the time when we used the blink - i think you can connect it any distance
The list of things I've bought to help my mom compensate for dementia related issues that were never used or briefly used is long and depressing.

It took me a long time to stop trying to fix the problem by buying things.

Your mileage may vary.
A grandpad is good for video calls and it has an auto answer feature. Someone with MCI should be able to figure out the simple interface.
With my dad we got rid of the cell phone and got him a Samsung smart watch. He can receive calls without his cell phone. It’s also good because if he leaves the house and gets lost, we can locate him. 

I suggest you start preparing things while he’s still able to, like where he would want to go as he declines. See a lawyer and get what you need to take over his finances and to make medical decisions on his behalf. It’s easier to get it set up now rather than after he’s declined too much.
I thought about the Apple watch also. If it didn't require charging as often as it does it would have been a no brainer. My dad will leave a watch on his wrist full time no problem. To try and add the charging stage it would just get lost. What I found worked best was a security camera system. I bought six totally wireless cameras that I could place in all the main rooms and by the doors. I could log in anywhere my cell phone worked and i could communicate through the built in speaker and microphone. Dad liked to get up at 2am and turn all the burners on the stove on...these cameras saved both our lives.
I know your question involves an Apple device but I wonder if you shouldn't be looking for an assisted living facility?  Our Dad will be needing more and more help and since you are not near it is going to be difficult for you to manage.  If you want him safe and you want some peace of mind that he is safe then consider moving him. Good luck.
Get am Amazon echo and install it every room in his home. Turn on the drop in feature. Buy yourself an echo. Then you have access to him 24/7 without him having to answer. Or get him an iPhone and turn on automatic answer.",2022-03-23 13:12:08,purple_mountain_cat,tl24p9

Dementia,Mom's gone,"Almost 4 years since her diagnosis, though she surely had it longer.  It was a slow, steady decline until January.  Then she got COVID and I think that just sped everything up.  She never fully recovered.  In February, she went to the ER because she was having seizures.  Turns out she had a urinary tract infection that went septic.  Spent a few days in the ICU, then several more days in a regular hospital bed.  From there to a rehab center, but still bed-ridden and her mind was deteriorating rapidly.  Didn't recongize people, thought she was a child at times, and in constant pain.  Last week, she was moved into Hospice Care and was giving straight morphine for the pain, which helped a lot but made her totally spaced out and even more incoherent.  And then yesterday, she passed away.  It's heart breaking, but at least she can finally rest and is no longer in pain.","I'm sorry for your loss.
God love you and your Mom!  So sorry for your loss, you are in my prayers.  Just went through this with my sweet mother in law last year.  Very rough.
So sorry for your loss. My dad left us in February. The first emotion was relief almost, because although at times he was bewildered and confused, we were fortunate that he never really got to a stage where he was frightened. It's just hitting home now that I'll never get to experience his trademark strong but gentle hug. I miss my dad.
I’m so, so sorry for your loss ❤️

Dementia,Our journey is over. Our story with Vascular Dementia,"I've lurked these boards for years, trying to solve the riddle of what our journey would look like, when it would end, how it would end, what I needed to do to be prepared for everything.  I read the posts from others about their journeys trying to find similarities and trajectories.  There's not as much information out there about vascular dementia progression as there is other dementias, so I'd like to share our experience in the hopes of helping others.  

My loved one had vascular issues for years.  She had had heart surgery about a decade ago but was doing well.  She was still able to walk on her own up until a year and a half ago.  I had been helping her for years but noticed in late 2016 - 2017 that she wasn't caring for herself as well as she used to. I talked her into selling her house since I was too far away to come as frequently as she would need. She moved into an assisted living facility.  She didn't like it one bit, but she did it.  That's when things really started to progress.  

The moved really highlighted just how bad she had become. Her memory was still very good - thankfully that remained in tact for much of the last 5 years.  Little things started to go, but people and events stayed.  Her dementia seemed to mostly attack her ability to figure out or interpret the world around her. 

One of the first things I noticed was her having difficulty writing checks.  Not remembering bills necessarily, but moreso how to write a check.  Letters that she would write started to become more messy. Words would be misspelled (she was an impeccable writer and flawless speller) or inverted or used incorrectly.  She also had difficulty using the key to her door.  When we would go shopping, she had difficulty reading the packages and only recognized items she purchased each week.  

I admit, these seem like pretty advanced issues, but I didn't notice until I looked back in retrospect what all these things meant.  She was very good at covering, especially in her own home.  

While in the assisted living, her disease progressed slowly.  She was able to walk about, go out to the stores and get her hair/nails done, anything she wanted.  She ate with utensils and drank from a cup with zero issues.  She toileted independently and had no incontinence.  Her memory remained good.  The main progression I saw during this time was that she started getting rid of everything - she gave away stuff or cut it up or ripped it and threw it out. Fidgety type behaviors I guess.  She called friends and family for chats or gripes but the agitation that she expressed at this time did become increasingly worse. 

She lived at the assisted living for years until she started having falls.  She went to the hospital (during covid) and they wouldn't allow anyone in with her.  She ""came to"" in the hospital and panicked.  She thought she had been kidnapped and was being tortured.  They chemically and physically restrained her.  All they had to do was let me in to explain to her and hold her hand, but they wouldn't.  I will always resent that with all my being.  Covid was no excuse to do that to her.  

Needless to say, this event really damaged her.  She never recovered.  She was placed in a memory care unit from the hospital.  She went from walking with a cane to being wheelchair bound for the rest of her days.  Her dementia progressed rapidly. 

The last 1.5 years she spent in this facility she slowly became less and less able to talk. She could ask questions and would remember many things still but if you asked her a question outside of the usual ""how are you?"", ""are you in any pain?"", ""how was your dinner last night?"", she would be unable to understand or answer appropriately.  

She also became incontinent - first single, then later on about a year in, double.  She became unable to drink from a cup without a straw.  She stopped using utensils  and could only feed herself with her hands.  She spent much of her time with a blank stare and didn't engage much.  She had always been such a social person.  

The last few months, she finally started to forget me.  She knew me, and with some explaining, she would remember me, I am so incredibly grateful for that.  But when I would see her, she would look at me for a while, I'd tell her in as many different ways as I could, that I was hers until she'd finally remember... and then she was so happy.  I cherish that so much.  

The beginning of the end for her was a bump on her leg.  We don't know what caused it, but for a month, it didn't get any smaller.  She didn't express any pain at all and the doctors said to treat it like a contusion.  They assumed she bumped the wheelchair or table or something of the sort.  

One day, the skin gave way and it burst.  The wound was treated and it appeared as though it was finally resolving.  Unfortunately, it became infected.  She was taken to the ER at the first sign of fever. The amazing doctor there called me. She was so compassionate and respectful of my loved one. She said my LO had sepsis.  She had read my LO's healthcare directive and knew that she didn't want any antibiotics and so suggested hospice.  I agreed and the placement was made.  Before she left the hospital, though, an ER nurse called me and asked me if I wanted to talk to my LO on the phone. I spoke to her for a few minutes, told her I loved her and that I was on my way and would be with her in a few hours.  She didn't respond, but the nurse said she was blinking her eyes and was listening.  I am forever grateful for that nurse, because that was the last time I spoke to her while she was awake.  

She arrived at the hospice but wasn't responding when they tried to give her something to drink.  She was no longer able to swallow.  Fluids and food were then stopped.  Morphine was administered.  She never opened her eyes again.  I stayed with her as long as I could each day - leaving only to eat and sleep.  On her sixth day, I left to get lunch.  I kissed her and told her I'd be back.  

On my way back to the hospice, I got the call.  She had passed ten minutes ago.  I wasn't there.  I didn't want her to be alone, but I suppose that's what she wanted.  I wanted so badly to be there with her. I hope she wasn't waiting for me. She was so very loved and I was so very loved by her.  What a blessing our love for each other was. 

&#x200B;

Ultimately, our dementia journey lasted 5 years of active management although it probably began before then (I just didn't recognize it). I don't think she had any ""step-like"" progression like they say. Hers was just a slow, steady decline, punctuated  by two hospital stays.  There were no strokes or big health events.  She was 95. 

I hope this may help some of you on your journey with your loved ones.  While you're going through it, it's so frustrating and so hard.  The not knowing is tremendously hard.  Keep loving them as fiercely as you do, even when you don't feel like you're loving them, you are through your actions.  Love is an act as well as an emotion. Let your acts carry you through the times when your heart's just not in it.  And be kind to yourself.","Virtual hugs and thank you for sharing a story that must’ve been very difficult to live out in yet with love and kindness. God bless

Your story brought tears to my eyes. God Bless you and sending a hug.
Thank you for sharing. I'm very sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry that the story has ended and not in a way in which you were anticipating, however you've captured the experience and your relationship with this person so beautifully in this post.
Gentle hugs to you. I'm so incredibly sorry for your loss. Your story sounds similar in many ways to my journey with my mom, and I know that your emotions right now are all over the place. Thank you for sharing your story with all of us.
'Love is an act.'
Thank you, that's a wonderful sentiment. 
So sorry for your loss. Thank you too for sharing your journey.
I'm teary eyed and have a lump in my throat. What a detailed description of the events that gave way to being released. Thank you for that. Hugs.
Thank you for sharing your experience and I am very sorry for your loss. My sister and I have been struggling lately because my mom's symptoms started young (59 years old), also we are very young because she also had us late in life so sometimes it's hard to keep up with life's demands while dealing with her. It's not at all convenient as well here to have her stay in any facility because in our culture, it doesn't work that way (not to mention, facilities here for that purpose is expensive). I admire your strength, and reading your experience made me want to extend my patience to the maximum so I could have more love for her than frustration.
Thank you so much for posting this.
Thank you for sharing this, and my condolences on your loss.  

Every journey is different, but it all ends up at the same destination.
Hugs to you from an internet stranger. Our stories are all different but all, in some ways, exactly the same. I'm sorry for your loss, but I'm glad you got the chance to say goodbye.
Thank you for sharing. I’m sorry for your loss. My mother passed in August from Vascular Dementia as well. Their journeys were quite similar. They began and ended very much the same. It’s a terrible disease for everyone involved.
Thank you for sharing this. It's clear that you loved her very much and I'm sure she knew that.
Im balling my eyes out how you've made me think a lot harder 

my frustration and anger at times shows Mom has Vascular Dementia she as well can fool a lot of people.

Thank you for the information
Thank you for sharing this beautiful story.
Heartbreaking, but the love between the two of you overshadows the sorrow.
Thank you so much for sharing some of the details of the progression of dementia that you noticed and your kinds and loving words towards your Loved One.",2022-03-23 10:33:31,___whoops___,tkvabl
Dementia,Looking for tech suggestions for wall display for reminders,"Hello everyone. My parents are suffering with early dementia yet are “functional” and living independently in a senior community. However, their short term memory is declining. I would love to put a large screen on their wall that I can update from afar (I am out of state) with reminders, notices, etc. that they can’t miss and need to interact with to get information. 

They are not good at writing things down (notepads, whiteboards). If I can update a device myself and post it digitally, I’m hoping that will help. 

I purchased an Amazon Show but they don’t think to ask it what their schedule is for the day. And I’m not sure how much they use it since I’m not there day to day. 

Also, my Mother is constantly losing her iPhone so we can’t rely on any reminders coming from that device. 

Any suggestions?

Thanks!","Wonderful idea. I don't have any tech suggestions, beyond wondering if there is an e-picure frame to which you can push a ""picture of the day,"" with the pix being a snapshot of ""today's schedule."" Bonus points if it has a display that will rotate through a few images—you as their loving child; wedding photo; pix of family or places. (Movement & change catch the eye better than static images.)

When my father was newly widowed, declining, I set a pattern of calling him daily at exactly the same time of day. Come hell or high water, exactly the same time to the minute. If I was a minute late, he noticed!

Mostly we talked about banalities. Some days, he used me to send a remote grocery order to be delivered. Once in a blue moon, he didn't answer, even after a few calls—sometimes, bathroom; sometime he had fallen asleep in front of the TV. I was able to dispatch staff from the indy living place for a wellness check. 

It also gave him a prompt to reveal anything new or troubling. Latest doctor visit or test results; a fall earlier in the day, etc. And it gave me a chance to remind him verbally of tomorrow's schedule. You might prompt your folks to write a brief note as you speak with them. 

If they've got a cell or a landline that doesn't depend in electricity, power outages, so much the better. If mom loses the cell, a burner phone dedicated ti those call, which remains on a charger, same location in their house, except when in use, ringer set to ""high"" in case it wanders off. 

My 2¢ worth, at least consider low tech.
Can you program an Alexa for daily reminders? Also I have a disabled daughter who has a programmable watch with an audible and vibrating alarm... Not sure if you can still find those but I found it online.
I haven't done this myself, and I'm no IT expert so I don't know if it will work, but Chrome Remote Desktop is supposed to be a pretty easy way for someone to access their own computer over the internet.  If you set up a computer in your parents' home and could remote into it, you could display your updates, etc. on the monitor at their place.
I think the issue is would they be able to use that?  If they are not good at writing things down then I doubt they will remember to interact with a screen on the wall.  Could you try setting up Alexa with reminders?  I have to say I have reminders set for my husband and often he gets the reminder then forgets right away.  I also have a white board with reminders, all he has to do is look at it, and he doesn't do that.  It can be a real challenge because with short term memory loss it gets real difficult to keep them on track.",2022-03-23 09:13:43,MediumFunrun,tktnj8
Dementia,Feeling like a failure,"I (43F) moved mum (70F) into a memory care facility on Monday. She has called repeatedly asking to leave, offering money to pick her up, very upset. I know this is best for her but can't help but feel like I'm failing her. I was her source of security and could calm her when others couldn't. Now I'm the one causing upheaval.

Update: Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. Mum ate breakfast today, participated in an exercise class and chatted with others in the hallways. And the got her to shower last night! Small (major) victories!","You’re not failing her for moving her to a place with people who can care for her new needs better than you can alone. 

You did everything you could for her for as long as you were able to, and you knew when it became too much for you to tackle alone.

You haven’t failed her. You just recruited more people to be able to help you help her more.
I've been there. Oh boy have I been there. You're not failing her.

It takes time for them to get adjusted to their new reality. My dad fought us every step of the way, it broke my heart. I felt like I was the one who effectively shut the door to the rest of his life, I felt terrible. 

But she WILL adapt. She is under the best care, what she needs right now. Dementia patients don't do well with change, but they do adapt eventually. 

Stay strong, and take care of yourself now. You deserve it, and soon you will see that this is the best and most loving decision you can do for your mom. Good luck.
You're simply acting out of responsibility and love (though I can absolutely understand the feelings you're going through). Perhaps if her brain weren't damaged, she could understand that this is what's best for her too. I'm bracing for this myself with my mom and all I can think to do is just visit every single day until she's as acclimated as she's going to be. She took care of my grandma and great aunt (no genetic relation, my mom's adopted) in their home when really they should've been in memory care, and I saw the toll it took on her. You need to do whatever you need to do to feel at peace with your decision. You can weather this.
You are a winner for doing the best thing for your mom and for you.  For you because you need your sanity and health to better care and make decisions for your mom.

Assuming you are able to, the best thing in the short term is to visit her often, and/or have other familiar faces (family and friends) visit her.  

My mom when she was semi-OK, was mentally preparing herself for a move to an assisted living place. When she really started to slip and we moved her, she would waffle with being furious at being “dumped at a nursing home” (“you all just want to get rid of me”) to “this is such a nice place.”  

She will find her routine. Never, never feel like a failure.
Oh man, I feel this.  You're not failing her.  At all.  There comes a time when you need to leave it up to the professionals.  My mom did the same thing.  She did eventually settle in - it took about 6-7 months, though.  By getting her professional care, you are affording her some of the dignity that this disease will take away from her.  There comes a point where we all have to realize that we simply cannot provide the care our loved ones need.  I'm a purchasing agent, not a memory care professional.  \*\*Hugs\*\*
We are taking the step of moving Dad (86) into memory care this coming Monday.  We have spent the last week filling out the paperwork, getting finances in order, figuring out what to take…  I anticipate that this will be horrible.  The place is really, really nice and he can take his golden retriever (guess how long it took to find a suitable place that allows him to keep his big dog?!), but he is going to be super unhappy to be out of his house where he lives with my sister (about 6 blocks from me, so he sees me just about every day and I usually take he and his dog for walks).  I am so dreading it.  We haven’t told him yet because he most likely won’t understand.  If he is somewhat lucid tomorrow morning (before getting tired or sundowning) we may try to tell him to gauge his reaction.  He has no phone so I doubt he’ll be able to call us much, and even if someone calls us for him, his ability to speak has declined a lot.  While we have been so guilt-ridden at the thought of moving him away from family (although we’ll visit daily), my sister got word yesterday that a job that she really, really wants and had given up on after no word for a month, she got it.  She wouldn’t be able to care for my dad like she has with the new job.  It felt sort of like fate (or our angel mom in heaven) was telling us we are doing the right thing.

Dementia,I’m breaking,"My aunt (73) recently suffered (an as yet unexplained to me) a health event & was hospitalized. She was diagnosed with congestive heart failure & was very cognitively impaired. 

She has since had stents placed to increase blood flow, but has permanent vascular dementia. I would say it’s fairly advanced, since she cannot recognize her own husband or children most days. 

I have not seen her yet myself. I’ve been trying to take care of the family members who’ve been more directly affected. But I’m dying inside. 

I’m mourning a person who is still here and I can barely stand to be in my own skin right now. 

I guess I need advice. Do & dont’s. That sort of thing. The very last thing I ever want to do is upset her. Even if she has no idea who I am, what can I do to make sure that my visit is a pleasant one for her?

I love her so much. I just…I don’t know how to do this. 

I’m sorry if this post is all over the place. I’m not exactly coherent right now.","Don't pressure her. Don't go in with expectations. Don't ask if she knows who you are. Just go in and be a nice person who's visiting with her. If she calls you by name, great. If she calls you by the neighbor lady from 30 years ago's name, go with it and just continue to visit.  Hopefully it'll be a pleasant visit for you both.",2022-03-23 01:55:31,Hotdogs-Hallways,tkn8sg
Dementia,Help. I don’t understand. Eating/dementia,"Hi. I’m taking care of my 81 year old aunt who may have had a series of mini strokes or may just be developing dementia. I took her in to see her doctor because she wasn’t eating enough and was getting confused. So he put her on 15 mg of mirtrazapine which I thought was awesome. She started eating more, sleeping better and was just more like herself, although pretty groggy in the morning. A month later, she began taking Nameda and she has been doing really well on that but, here’s the weird thing. She’s about 5’3” or 5’4” and weighs 155 pounds. When she first started developing confusion, I noticed she was better on days when she ate a lot — but it’s not like you can eat your way out of a stroke or dementia, right? 


Can anyone think of a reason why my aunt does better on days when she eats a lot?  Thanks.","Sleep, exercise, healthy diet. Those help your body and the brain. It’s not going to reverse anything, but it will help  stabilize. My mother has better days when she eats balanced meals and has a good fluid intake.
You word it as if she does better on days that she eats more, but it more likely that she eats more on days that she does better. See the difference? She will have bad days and better days. Those better days, she is more “with it” and more likely to eat.
If she's eating more regularly, her body is going to function better. Better blood sugar, etc. I know if my blood sugar gets out of whack because I don't eat enough, I get fuzzy headed and can't determine on my own how to assemble a sandwich.
She did better when she ate because the body needs fuel(food).  My father only wanted to eat cereal, his dementia was getting much worse.  He also has hypoglycemia so his headaches were worse along with his confusion.  We bought him protein drinks, the days we got him to drink those his confusion was lessened.",2022-03-23 00:39:26,Potter299,tkm44z
Dementia,Throwing stones at God,"I am pissed...I am furious...2 years gone and I still cry, I still want to scream all my fury and loss up into the sky. If you have the time, I'd like to tell you a story. I will try not to ramble, but it's a story that needs to be told if only to hopefully put it to rest....
  Growing up it was my mom and I, we had my grandparents and aunt and uncle's but they were rarely around. My grands were abusive and the others indifferent. My mom put herself through college and worked her ass off to put a roof over our heads... something I never really understood the strain of until I grew older. 
  She had always been eccentric, always a little off but in a fabulous way in most regards. We had the first home computer in our neighborhood, one of the first to connect to the internet..she loved art, music cooking and medieval history.I'm telling you all this to gain a grasp of her intellect.  My entire life I never heard a lie leave her lips or a curse worse that calling someone a ""nut nut"". Was she perfect?? Fuck no. I had been asking her to seek help for mental health issues since I was 20...I'm 42 now. I promise you this is all relevant. 
  She started really sliding down hill around 15? Years ago. It's hard to judge times...like I said she was eccentric, I just thought my crazy mom is acting like my crazy mom. Until it was more than that. I blew off a lot of what in retrospect I shouldn't of because they were very, very big warning bells. What finally woke me up to her mind truly slipping was that she could not remember what car was mine parked in my own driveway, a car I had had for 10 years. 
 A bunch of other slips started happening, couldn't remember my kids ages, her personality started to rapidly change... very VERY! Angry. I did finally manage to get her to see a psych doctor. The list of disorders was almost a page long ( this happened before she got to far gone btw). PTSD anxiety depression were at the forefront.
 Then the delusions started. 'theres someone climbing on the roof"" "" there's a peeping Tom at the window'  she made multiple phone calls to the police about a random neighbor and a highschool friend trying to drive her crazy.   I became very good friends with the police. 
 I should state that at this time she was living with my alcohol grandmother as my grandmother's caretaker. They did not have the best if relationships at the best of times.  My grandmother was also a horder. 
 The situation progressed until the council of elders intervened. My mother's doctor would not listen to any of us, wanting only to focus on her diabetes...bitch the lady can't take her meds if she can't remember them.  She was finally placed in an assisted living facility. Unfortunately she continued to decline at a very rapid rate. She would constantly try to escape thinking my grandmother's house was right outside. She got very mean and very violent even as her body forgot how to function, by the end I couldn't get her into my car to take her home for weekends. 
 I'm losing steam writing this. 2020 hit and I couldn't see her at all until it was to late, but really it had been to late for at least 4 years...that was our last really coherent talk anyways. I got to talk to her on the phone a few times but always set her off. I got a call from the home that she was in the hospital for a UTI...later get a call from the hospital that I had better get paperwork signed cause it looked like she was checking out soon. Ketoacidosis. Her whole body is shutting down. 
 I run down there, an hours drive from here, covid regs so I can only stay 15 minutes and that's only because it's an end of life visit...fuck that. I climbed in bed with her, put on her favorite music on my phone and I laid right there for an hour. That is where we did goodbye. I had a few blessed minutes where she was there, where she knew who I was. It didn't last long but she hadn't known me in 3 years so I will take that time to my grave
 2 days later she was moved to another hospital even farther away, I was told to come say goodbye again. It was an active covid floor so I had to sign a bunch of waivers and get suited up in a marshmallow suit. I called all the fam on video chat, laid down next to her husk and tried to be as brave as I could as I talked and tried to assure everyone without breaking myself.  I got the call she had passed that night.  No wake, no funeral..just me by myself going to deal with the morge and her ashes. 
  Bottom line to anyone still reading...I'm still pissed. I'm furious something like this could happen to someone who tried so hard to be a decent person despite all the odds and unfairness and suffered so much before dementia got it's hooks in. I want her back. I want the time that was robbed. She died at 62, she left me in her 50s. I hope when my time is up I get to sock god one for all the people lost within themselves cause it's a living hell. 
 End rant

 Edit: thank you to the nurses at Cape cod hospital for not kicking me out after 15 minutes. You have no Idea how much that time ment to me.

https://youtu.be/SSOPkhe67Vo.     This song is very fitting to all of us here I think.","I'm so sorry and can relate to this so hard. The covid restrictions for our elderly loved ones in homes like this have been entirely too restrictive and inhumane.  

I lost 2 years with my loved one and in that time she progressed so so much due to the isolation and lack of stimulation.  The home where she was living wouldn't let anyone in for more than 30 minute visits and you had to schedule them - but only 2 people were allowed in the building at a time - so of course no one could ever see their loved ones.  They still have restrictions in place despite everyone there being vaccinated and boosted and requiring visitors to be vaccinated and/or tested.  It makes me so bitter and angry.

I'm so sorry OP.  I have to believe they know how much we loved them and still love them and wanted better for them.  This time was stolen from us. It should've been different.
I feel your pain completely. It’s not fair. And it is such a horrible way to die. I lost my brilliantly clever and funny mom on dec 13 last year. When I think about the last 10 years — all the warning signs, all the big changes, all the incidents that accelerated her decline, up until the fall she had that broke her arm and led to her death a month later — and my heart just aches for her and how her life was for the last little bit of it. I don’t wanna have that kind of existence in the final stretch of mine. Just give me a handful of pills or send me to Oregon so I can die in peace before I lose everything I am. 

I’m the youngest of her 5 kids. And I’d argue she was closest with me in the last couple years, even though our relationship was probably the most volatile and problematic. One beautiful thing that happened because of the dementia (especially in the earliest stages) was she was so much more open to my way of seeing the world. She had less fear of being judged, she felt safe with me & trusted me. I can sometimes find comfort in those thoughts. But then it’s easy to get stuck in the “I could’ve/should’ve done more” cycle. It’s infuriating to think of alllllll the ways I tried to help out and unite all the family caretakers in our plan of action, only to be completely ignored and not taken seriously. Her quality of life could’ve been SO much better than it was in her last years. 

I am so fucking grateful that I got to be with her when she died. I think about it all the time. I did something similar to you — laid with her on the bed, or on the comfy chair right next to her bed, listening to the Love Story soundtrack, which she always loved. My sibs and I got 3 days with us all together with her. Hospice said the absolute latest she’d still be alive was Monday morning. They woke me up sometime at 7am to tell me she was having her final moments. And I did my best to fill her with love and peace as she left me. That’s all we can really hope for in the end. That our last thought will be a good one. 

Fuck, I loved my mom… she deserved better than she got. 

I’m sorry you went through all of it alone. Even though it’s been a rocky road sibling-wise for me, I can’t imagine not having them to grieve alongside of. And it’s nice to think there are 4 other people that truly know exactly how I feel and that we all hurt for the loss of her. I’m so happy that you got that special time with her. It will be a source of comfort to you in the many years of grief you have yet to feel. Honestly, it’s also really comforting just to be able to know anyone else that’s felt the agony of dementia, and be able to swap stories. Most people have a 3 month window of when they’re willing to wanna hear about someone else’s grief. After that, people tend to think you should be over it & they have much less patience to deal with a sad, grieving friend. Luckily, everyone here I think wants to share their story as well as hear others’ tales of grief. It helps. So thanks for sharing, and thanks for reading.",2022-03-22 23:14:45,Ancient-Commercial75,tkkn2j
Dementia,How do I pay myself? I,"How do I pay myself? I am a power of attorney for a widowed parent with Alzheimer's.  She lives with me, and I am the primary caregiver.   I am not seeking to take advantage of her, but she has the funds and caregiving without payment is making me financially stressed. Still, as her POA, I don't want to write checks to myself because that seems like a conflict of interest. Should I set up a trust with the caregiver agreement terms as part of the trust? What do you guys do?","I’d check in with an elder law attorney.  I was in a similar situation and our attorney just had me do a caregiver agreement that I signed both on my moms behalf as her POA and on my behalf as the caregiver.  It seemed really weird to me to be able to do that, but he said it was not a problem.  Still though, I wouldn’t recommend anyone else do that without consulting someone who really knows how the laws work.  Maybe it’s different state to state.

Edited to add:  once I had the document I did have to log my hours that I was paying myself for and I think we turned those in to Medicaid when the time came to apply for that.  As far as paying myself, I just transferred the money from her account to mine.  I don’t believe the lawyer asked me to keep any sort of paper trail other than her bank statements.
You can and should get paid if you are full-time caregiving. Depending on your parent's income, you may qualify under DSHS. Call your local Aging and Disability program to find out if your family qualifies. The other option is to become your parent's Guardian/Conservator. This is more costly, but you can have a court order giving you a salary out of your parent's savings/income.
Our dad had dementia and there are 5 siblings. We took care of him on a rotation basis for  2 1/2 years in his home….well 4 of us did….another story
I had one checkbook my brother had the other
I was listed as POA and had been on his checking account for years. My brother paid bills and took care of mechanical stuff, I grocery shopped picked up rx and took care of any business problems. He died in June last year. He had a significant amount of $$
After discussion with my brother we decided to write a one time check to the 5 of us and my aunt, his sister. That was it
He had a small life insurance policy that covered his funeral expenses 
The balance in his account covered expenses until the house was sold
You can pay yourself up to 15k per year as a gift from her without paying income tax. It can be spread out over 12 months if you want. Also, If you have a spouse she can give another 15k per year to them.
Just keep all receipts, someone correct me if I’m wrong but don’t they have to be submitted annually to court of protection? But then you can just take money spent from the account as and when you spend it on your mum or her care",2022-03-22 19:31:46,ParticularBug6218,tkgbi2
Dementia,Could decades of verbal/emotional abuse cause or contribute to dementia?,"My wife and I moved in with my parents last summer to help my step-father with caregiving for my 78-yr-old mother, who has vascular dementia. Over these past 9 months we have witnessed and experienced this man's relentless barrage of condescending comments and criticisms towards all 3 of us, but particularly towards his wife/my mother.  

I saw snippets of this growing up and then when visiting home over the years, but pre-dementia my mother was assertive and able to hold her own in arguments. He was also less blatant and aggressive when others were around. This past year we've been seeing him at his unfiltered worst.  

We really suspect that 40 years of constant verbal/emotional abuse could be a major contributing factor in my mother's dementia. Her brain's solution to decades of unrelenting stress?","In my very unscientific observations of women who I personally know that developed dementia/Alzheimer’s, before they developed dementia, all four of them had to take care of very sick husbands (3 terminal cancers, 1 Parkinson’s).  These wives were under tremendous stress and I can guess had a lot of anxiety. So, IMO, I think that could be a link???
Not a scientist or a doctor but I believe the constant beat down of stress contributes to memory loss. It seems like I've read depression could also play in as a factor to dementia.
I've also thought this to be a contributing factor too. From a scientific perspective I'm not sure how to actually explain it though.
My grandmother was the abusive one and she's the one who got Alzheimer's.

Both of her children have dementia now. Emotional abuse or genetics? My money is on genetics.
As a caregiver…
My mother had Alzheimer’s in her 70s, and now my 59 yr old husband has dementia. Their only
Link is me😳. I don’t think this is causational.
Depression and anti-depressants are linked to dementia/Alz, yes. That type of abuse can certainly contribute. So sad and uncalled for. Sheesh.

Edit: Also, stomach issues are related to stress and can affect brain health, depression, anxiety, all related to outside factors...
What is his abuse doing to you and your wife? With all the stress of caring for a person with dementia, I'd be afraid of losing my shit under a barrage of criticism.
I think I’ve seen a couple articles suggesting that anxiety might link to dementia…though I’m not sure how much research has actually been done on it.  My mom didn’t have the verbal abuse, but did have serious anxiety most of her life, and I have suspected that might have been a contributing factor for her.  After a lifetime of anxiety, it was around the time she declared bankruptcy and her son died that she started showing symptoms…it just seemed like her brain couldn’t take it anymore.
I'm my personal experience...I really think it does, or at the very least the speed at which it claims a person.
I don't know if there's any scientific research on this, but from personal experience I think abuse can contribute. It might not be the root cause, but I believe it can speed up the progress/make it worse. 

My grandmother started rapidly declining after her husband has died (he was a high-functioning alcoholic), and she was left with her son who had a much worse alcohol problem, was stealing her money and beating her up.",2022-03-22 16:21:58,VociCausam,tkc5m7
Dementia,"I'm so tired. How in the hell are you supposed to raise a family, maintain a career, and manage some self-care when your time is being nickle and dimed away being a care-giver?","My mom (early dementia) and dad (Alzheimers) are both in a facility, but I am constantly having to respond to one ""crisis"" or another. Yesterday, it was my mom's dog being ""aggressive"" 14 years old and arthritic. So I had to help with that. Then my mom's friend has started calling saying my mom is either sad or frantic and I need to come visit. Or the care level is changing, so I have to sign papers. Or I need to find a new dentist. Or deal with insurance. Or argue with lying med techs. Or stand in shock at a shitty hair cut. Or clean up my dad. Or check my mom and dad's mail. Or gather their tax documents. AND still hold down a job and be a positive father. I'm exhausted and don't know what to do.","When you find the answer, please let me know.
Meanwhile, gentle hugs to you.
I only have my husband to take care of. I’m mostly retired. It’s exhausting. I can’t even imagine how those who have families and FT careers do it. 

It’s easy for me to say, but can you set some boundaries? The mother’s friend - don’t talk to her. Haircuts - they will grow out. Lying techs - in my state of AZ, it’s legal to put a camera in their room as long as it’s not hidden. 

Also, just like in the business world, delegate as much as possible. Much easier said than done, I know. 

Consider touring and maybe changing facilities. My husband goes to a day care where they keep him busy all day and he loves it. 

Sorry, I’m an engineer so look to the practical side of matters. The whole thing just sucks, really. My heart goes out to you.
I can only wish you luck (and be thankful for my two siblings). 

A co-worker who had lost his parents, and a friend whose wife is slipping into dementia, both kept telling me ""Just remember- it gets worse and then it ends"" and I'm afraid they weren't wrong.

I'm in the ""how the #$%# do I deal with Dad's life insurance payout since it goes us and we need the money to deal with the house, and where do we find the time to get the house ready for sale?"" stage now (Answer: Somewhere find time to talk to a lawyer.)
Wow. You have a lot on your plate. I'm so sorry. 

My dad isn't in memory care yet. I guess I naively assumed the staff at the facility would be addressing most of these problems. 😳
I saw my mom's decline and I got power of attorney for her. She has been living with us for 4 years. I then established a QIT (Qualifying income Trust) with the help of an elder lawyer. Then we got my mom on Medicaid. Then we became eligible for home health care 5 days a week. She got COVID and had a stroke since then (on top of the dementia) and now she is mostly in bed and has a g-tube (feeding tube)-she is slowly beginning to swallow again. She gets OT, PT and feeding therapy. We also get lots of medical supplies like diapers, chuckies, gloves. My wife and I both have careers although I will be retired in a few months. Plus we have three kids (2 college age and a fifth grader and a dog and a leopard gecko living with us. My wife has been way better than me. She is more patient and loving (maybe because her own mom died of cancer at the age of 52.). It's been rough but it looks like you need extreme help.
Change your level of responsiveness to health emergencies only for a couple of weeks, give yourself a break. Anytime someone sees a need for you to fill, ask them to fill it for you.
No advice that hasn't already been said but just wanted to say I'm glad you posted this, but it's also mildly terrifying. I thought once I got my mom in memory care I'd mostly just need to visit her and not be terribly involved in admin stuff still. I'm so sick of not working during my prime years, not feeling well because of the stress, and being unable to start a family because how on earth would I have time and be able to be a good mom. It sucks but there will be better days for all of us.
It doesn’t get better it gets worse
Our dad, 5 of us , took care of our dad 2 1/2 years 24/7 in his home until June when he died. We rotated in and out and it still was not easy, but we decided not to place him. We argued and cussed each other out be we stuck to the bottom line it was about daddy. Hell we even disagreed about what to do with the house, but we took 3 months to clean it out, cosmetic repairs and sold it as is and split the leftovers.

It’s hard, really hard
I hear ya, and I don't know. Just found out my sibling wants me to be the landlord for my mothers place so we can put her in a home she can afford. On top of being her live in caregiver and working from home. 

""you're handy with no kids or wife""
A small help would be to get your parents mail forwarded to your address. Only the first class and endorsed mail will come so you won't have to deal with bulk business mail (junk mail)
I have no idea, this is my struggle as well, except that I’m chronically ill so I have no spare energy to give. So mostly I just feel like I’m letting every one down. This is just impossible to go through I think.
Your feelings are so valid. You have so much going on.
I just wanted to share that it is very unfair of your mom’s friend to call you and expect you to go see her at the drop of a hat. It sounds like you are spending a lot of time with them already. 
Your mom may not remember that you just came the day before or whenever it was and so she may tell friend that she hasn’t seen you in days or even months.  I think you may benefit from setting boundaries with the friend. You know that your parents are safe and being taken care of. It is important for you to take care of yourself, too.
Could you talk to your mom’s friend and tell her that you appreciate her concern and how much she is there for your mom, but that you are visiting X times per week or whatever, and that you need to allow the staff to care for your mom when you cannot be around because you have other responsibilities?

I wish I had advice for the other things. I just want to offer words of encouragement that you are bing such an incredible help to your parents. They are lucky to have you. Don’t beat yourself up about the things that you aren’t able to get done, because you are going above and beyond already.
This isn’t something that you do in your spare time, it is a legit (and necessary) part-time job. 

Your sibling can handle financial and legal stuff from a distance. 

If you think the home is decent, ie your parents aren’t being abused or neglected - in my province that would only be 15% of homes! - Moving as close to the home as possible would help a lot.
I feel your pain.    I am going through the same situation.   Except I am trying to keep my mom home.   

You stated, Level of care changing?    

Please elaborate?   Explain both parents health over the past 6 months. 

Once you give me the information I may have a solution
I’ve been in your shoes.  I helped take care of my grandfather after my grandmother died.  His dementia was manageable because my mother, his daughter, had retired.  Then the worst thing happened-my mother died suddenly from an aneurysm.  I ended up being sole caretaker.  My mother’s sister helped when she could, but she lived in a different city.  It really broke my heart to see him decline so rapidly after my mom died.  For a few months he called me by her name, then started thinking I was his older brother.  He was 89 when my mom died.  He wasn’t expecting to bury a child. I finally had to put him in a home when he fell.  It was then that his doctor told my aunt and me that my grandfather had prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.  He was in the facility for exactly one month when he died.  I’m so sorry you have to do all of it.  It gets weary thinking, planning, and deciding for someone who can’t do it for themselves anymore.  If you need someone to vent to, just send me a message.

Dementia,Has anyone found a solution to dementia sufferer going down middle of the night and leaving every light on?…,"Our electricity bills are gonna be ridiculous. Other than locking my dad in his room, are there any solutions? A device that kills power to the lights after so many minutes maybe. We could kit the house with sensor lights but I think he’d still use the main ones","L.e.d. light bulbs. They use sooo little electricity!
I put light covers over the light switches. It's like $3 for 10 on Amazon
My grandmother had dementia and lived alone until she couldn’t. She unplugged things at night, TV, lamps, appliances, etc. we think she worried about a house fire… she was a bit of a hoarder with paper and kept anything & everything that came through the mailbox.
Interested
They make light switches that activate when you walk in and shut off after no activity for a few minutes. Motion detection switches. As far as lamps you’ll probably have to unplug them every night
We have motion sensor lights in our basement. They’re great, as long as you don’t find someone sitting in the dark! Gotta move around to activate the light but I believe you can adjust the sensitivity and how long they stay on for.
Smart lightbulbs? I believe you can set rules for them such as after 8 pm they have a timer on them for 30 mins",2022-03-21 19:27:24,afox1984,tjp4qn
Dementia,My dad died in Jan ‘22 and my mom has had dementia since 2013,"My mom was a very driven career lady working in finance. She loved her job and lived a healthy lifestyle and  had good relationships. But then she got dementia at the age of 53. I was in grade 11. I mostly blocked the pain but all focus was on her. 

My dad became both parents. In 2019 he got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and then all focus went to dad. We had found a routine with mom so she was sorted and not much had to be changed with her. 

Now that my dad has died attention is back fully on my mom. It’s so hard. I struggle spending time with her because she’s changed so much. I know that she is still my mom but I miss my mom mom. I didn’t get an opportunity to have an adult relationship with her. My dad was good in many ways but also very horrible in others as a dad and a husband. I found out in recent years after taking my mom to her appointment alone (cause I was older) with the neurologist that she was diagnosed with syphilis  encephalitis. It was all so much and I just bottled that in. I just think my mom (and my dad) have gotten really shitty deals in life and it’s hard to reconcile. My dad because he was raised under apartheid and I don’t know what demons he has from his childhood but I suspect some dark wounds- just from hearing how certain things are recounted. 

I’m mad at my mom for not leaving my dad before she got dementia. I’m mad at my dad for being abusive towards my family, cheating on my mom and leaving us with a whole lot of mess after his passing. 

I Love my parents but man I’m so mad at them. I know that them changing the things that I found as problems wouldn’t have changed their outcomes but they could have been happier separately and saved us a whole lot of trauma.",Your anger and sadness is more than justified. It can be difficult to take the ‘caregiver’ hat off and allow ourselves to feel. It is all part of healing and letting go. Be gentle on yourself….,2022-03-21 17:25:51,Honest_Monitor_2989,tjmgcm
Dementia,What's your name?,"What's your name?   

First time Mom asked me that, it broke me.   

She still asks every time I'm with her. But the horror and sadness are gone.   

Because her smile and attempt to take my hand in hers when she asks, tells me she knows.   

It's a true moment of connection.","i feel ya. its my everyday. mine thinks i'm her brother but eventually realizes i'm her son. first month of it happening was tough but now its par for the course sadly.  really miss having more than one word conversations with her, seems like i'm the only one talking most of the time.

hugs sent your way.
That's beautiful.
She still can feel the love you have for her.  

It’s so sad, though.  My mother asked me the other day if I was her mom.   Then she asked me how my mom was doing.  I can’t imagine having having dementia and nothing making sense.   But I just tell her I love her and I hope that is enough.

It’s so good that you have a loving connection with your mother despite the dementia.
Although one gets used to this scenario, it still hurts whenever I facetime call my mother. During the first few minutes, she remembers me. And along the conversation, she will talk to me describing her daughter living in Spain (that's me) and how I am doing these past few years..so yeah, there will come a time it wouldn't hurt anymore..but not today..",2022-03-21 14:14:35,mattthecaregiver,tji5ez
Dementia,"What can be done, medically?",My mum is 67 years old and is terrible at remembering words. She can’t complete sentences without having to describe the word she’s thinking of. I think she may have dementia so I told her to visit the doctor but she claims there’s nothing that can be done. Is she correct? Is there anything I can do to persuade her to visit the doctor? We are based in the UK.,"While there's nothing that can be done to reverse dementia per se certainly there are a variety of meds that can help slow it down and improve symptoms, if ever so slightly.  Aricept and so on.  

Persuasion to see a doctor is another matter.  Only suggestion is to get her there on another pretense - a general health checkup perhaps - and the primary can certainly do basic neuro screen tests while she's there and refer her to a neuro.  

Convincing someone with dementia to do things is non trivial but often you just have to use careful persuasion, creative lying, etc. to get them to do things especially as it relates to their health as they are very often convinced absolutely nothing is wrong with them and they are perfectly fine.  Sometimes even just say setting an appointment and getting them in the car and on the way and before they necessarily even realize they are going to the doctor they may resist a lot less once they are there; e.g., you could say ""Hey let's go out to lunch"" but really you're going to the doctor and maybe afterward actually take them to lunch as a reward.
Ask her to describe her symptoms to her GP, it’s entirely possible she may be on a medication that actually has speech aphasia as a side effect.
There are medical issues that fall under deleriums that can look a lot like dementia but are treatable. The only way to know for sure is to get her in to see a doctor.
I am not a medical professional, but here is my take after being a care giver for many of my elder family members. It’s not necessarily dementia. She should go to the doctor and see if something else might be at play. Infection, reaction to meds, or some other kind of medical problem that might get worse beyond forgetting words. Try to figure it out with her doctor and don’t let them be quick to just say dementia and write her off. My MIL was diagnosed with dementia and after being in and out of the hospital, in turns out it was really sleep apnea that had gotten extremely bad. In my opinion, Dementia should be last resort diagnosis when everything else has been ruled out. Older people have more specialized medical needs, kinda like children. I’m not sure how it works in the UK, but in the US we have a medical power of attorney designation that can be done fairly easy, so you can make medical decisions and be her advocate. Good luck.
The way I got my mom in was to tell her other (long deceased) family members had dementia or memory issues and it would really help MY health record if she got tested so I could have a family record for the future. Threw in that it would help out the grand kids as well. Since I took it off of her being diagnosed she went along with it.
Does she live on her own?

An improved diet may help imo.
She could try a med to slow down the progression. It’d give her more time doing as well as she can. Also she can plan ahead with you now so she has a say in what happens later.",2022-03-21 14:02:29,fafferoo,tjhvab
Dementia,Very quick decline,"Hi everyone. My father was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago, but continued on pretty well until about 2 months ago. He fell and broke his back. He was placed in a nursing home as my mom can’t take care of him herself (i live 5 hours away and go up when I’m able, but I have children in school). He was in the first nursing home and was in so much unbearable pain. He also caught Covid. He lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks, was so frail and weak. He was telling me and my mom he wants to pass on, he’s ready. But then there was a few days he was feeling a bit better. He started eating, was more lucid and seem like his normal self, just very frail. But then he got bad again. He started hallucinating. Seeing things, calling my mom and saying they were coming to get him and they hurt him. My mom called the nurses and they said he was very out of it. He had to be transferred to a more permanent nursing home as the previous was mostly a physical therapy one. Now he’s gotten really bad. He hasn’t eaten in 4 days now. He hardly recognized my mom when she went a couple days ago. He won’t answer the phone, I haven’t talked to him in over a week. He’s throwing himself out of the bed. It just seems so fast, the decline. I’m trying to comfort my mom as she’s looking into funeral homes. I just feel so numb and it feels like this isn’t real. Thank you all for listening.","My dad passed away today. I’m in shock even though I knew it was coming. Thank you for your responses.
Have you looked into Hospice and if they can help you and your mom with finding good social workers / therapists to talk to as you go through whatever transition this is.

It is like the sky has fallen in. I hope you and your family get the support you all need.
This is such a difficult situation, I'm sorry you're going through this. 
I think hospice is the way to go. You'll have experienced nurses helping to control dad's pain and helping you understand what to expect at each stage. 
Hospice is truly a gift, as it offers us time to spend just enjoying our loved ones instead of trying to ""fix"" their issues.
Falls accelerate. So do simple, often undetectable urinary tract infections. Testing for a UTI should always be done with a sudden decline. 

It sounds like it’s time for Hospice, tho.
I am so sorry for your loss. The decline of the loved is fast and even tho we knew it was coming it hit as a surprise. My mother in law funeral is tomorrow and it still looks like it’s not real and I feel numb as well. 

May your father Rest In Peace.  No more pain. And I wish you and your family my most sincere condolences.",2022-03-21 12:32:59,peridot_television_,tjfuxa
Dementia,The end is here but she's hanging on. I have to go.,"My loved one was put into hospice 6 days ago. She's not eating or drinking and not producing much urine at all. Her color is good and her hands are warm. I rushed out to be with her - 14 hours of travel- and I can't stay here forever. I have a family and work to take care of. This is killing me. 

I've been here with her for the last 4 days. Today is the fifth day. I have to go home soon. I have kids to care for. I'm afraid she won't pass while I'm here and I don't want her to be alone. 

Have any of you been through this before? How do you resolve this dilemma?","It's heartbreaking and I haven't had to go through it yet myself.

You have to go take care of the young people. 

Some people want to be alone when they pass, for whatever reason. They wait for loved ones to be out to a meal or something. 

Talk to your loved one. Let them know that you have been there for 4 days, and you have to leave today to go take care of the grandbabies. So if she needs to pass while you are there, she knows. Tell them that they have given you all the tools you need to take care of everything from here or whatever might ease their mind. 

And if you are not there when she passes, you do not have to feel guilty.
My mom died ten minutes or so after I left. I knew she was near death but, she seemed ok, so I went. More or less as soon as I got home, my SIL called to say she'd passed.

Everyone has stepped out of her room and she passed away... almost as if she was waiting to be on her own.

I do feel guilty about it.
My father waited until I was out of the room to pass.  I spent his last two days administering morphine every two hours to ease his pain.  When his death rattle became so pronounced it started to disturb to my mother, the nurse prescribed drops to calm it.  He died while I was on my way to the pharmacy to pick up the prescription.  At first I was angry and felt guilty because I wasn't with him when he passed.  Someone later told me he held on until everyone was out of the room because he didn't want us to witness his final moment out of respect for us.  I choose to believe the latter because that's the kind of person my dad was.
Both my parents and mother-in-law were in hospice care. 

They all lasted about seven days after they stopped drinking water. 

IMO you have done your duty.
She wouldn't want you to struggle like  this. Go, and know that you were there for as long as you could be. Sending hugs x
My mother waited until everyone was asleep before she passed. She had slowed down on her eat/drinking for weeks. She climbed out of bed and was found in a praying position.
This is common that they wait until loved ones leave.
My mother went 21 days without eating or drinking. That is not out of the normal range. She did go when everyone was out of the room.
My mom kissed my father goodbye, he left the room, she turned to where I was sitting and started agonal breathing. She passed minutes later. I think he knew she wanted him to go.
My grandma lasted 11 days. Her kidneys had shut down by day 5 but her heart kept on pumping. It was the most traumatizing, heartbreaking situation but she was so strong. It was unbelievable. She defied all the odds. I have no advice other than I know exactly how you feel and I’m so sorry.
My sister waited until the pizza guy came and nearly everyone stepped out of her room.
I’m really sorry for what you’re going through. My mother continued breathing (and occasionally moaning) for 15 days on end of life  care in hospital with no food or water, much longer than the doctors expected. It was horrible. I struggled with a dilemma like yours every time I escaped for a few hours to eat or sleep. She died in the early morning while I was at home in my bed and I will always feel some guilt and regret for not being with her when she took her last breath. Having said that, I think we imagine a lot of things about what it is like for those who are dying. That they were waiting for someone to arrive, or for someone to leave... Perhaps they have that power over their own deaths, perhaps not.
I know that, thanks to dementia, my mother sometimes didn’t know who I was even before she began dying. Or whether I was in the room with her. Add to that the delirium induced by being in the hospital, by the failure of multiple organs, by the pain medication, by the chemical processes of dying ... I have no way of knowing what her experience was like, but I suspect if there was any consciousness at all in those final days, it was not closely connected to the world around her. 
Back to your dilemma - There is no ideal answer, but my advice is do what you need to do for yourself now and for the self you will live with. Your loved one will be okay either way.
My sister waited until my mum and her kids left. Literally 20 minutes later.
My dad went the one night I decided not to go because I wasn’t feeling well.  Sounds silly but I felt his presence when it happened and felt at peace.
My father did not have dementia, (did have parkinsons though) but he was ill and we made him hospice. my mother was in the shower and my sister was helping her bathe (my mother has advanced dementia) and the hospice nurse called me to his room (we did at home hospice) and i did witness his last breaths. he had developed the death rattle overnight and i knew he was going to cross over that day. my father was a very strong and stubborn eastern European man. i am a physician; i do believe that he did not want my sister or mother to witness his passing and think he was OK with me witnessing it given me being a doc. my father cared for my mother as her dementia progressed. i do think that he knew i could be the one to ""handle it"". i did break the news to my mother and sister which is something i will never forget. 
i told him that i loved him, and prior to his passing a day or so before as he become more and more unresponsive  i told him it was ok for him to go. i told him we would take care of mom. my sister and i faced similar difficulties with having to go/attend to matters, i sympathize greatly. i am sorry you are going through this; comfort her, tell her you love her. many times people (as others have said in the comments) will choose to go when their loved ones are not there. if that is how they go it is not a lack of respect for you; they want to let go on their terms. perhaps spare you the difficulty. tell her you love her. 
all the best. writing this post has lead me to revisit these wounds and in a way has been very unexpected. apologies for the block of text.
I visited my dad every day for the last two months. Except the day he passed. I had an extremely tough day and though I'd give myself a much needed break. Got the call at about 7:30 that night. Mom was in the adjacent room where she was watching TV but had a visual on his bed. He passed alone.
Yes my grandmother did exactly the same thing and I felt horrible. Now that I can look back on it I wish someone had told me this happens and that its okay. She desperately wanted to go but she couldn't do it with me there. Once I realized that, I could move on and be at peace with her decision.",2022-03-21 10:31:58,elephantbloom8,tjd5ef
Dementia,Getting Up Every Night,"Has anyone had any success helping someone with dementia sleep better at night? We've heard of melatonin, CBD, reducing caffeine, fewer naps during the day, etc. Some say nothing can be done but it happens every night and everyone is exhausted because of it.","There are prescription meds that will keep them asleep. But honestly, to me, the night issues were my breaking point. I knew he got up often at night (I had interior cameras, he would go patrolling the house with his flashlight several times a night), but when it got to the point where he would walk around in the dark yelling and having imaginary arguments, that's when I knew it was time for full-time care. Time for the professionals, for the good meds, for constant supervision.
My MIL was a night wanderer, but we’ve been able to implement a couple of things that have really cut down on her nighttime escapades (by about 80%)- she still gets up at night to use the bathroom, but she doesn’t usually patrol the house, flick on all the lights in our house and open our bedroom door at 3:00 AM asking, “Where is everyone?” (That last one TRIGGERS me!) So we don’t let her nap during the day/evening (that one is important), we eliminate caffeine (if she does have caffeine, it’s coffee at breakfast- the rest of the time it’s decaf tea) and I try to get her out for a short walk every day (my average is 5-6 walks/week). We also give her extended release melatonin at 4 mg (non-extended release didn’t work for MIL) along with Celestial Seasonings Extra Sleepytime tea about a half hour before bed (it’s not foolproof but we’ve had much better success with consistency with her sleep patterns).
This was a battle with my Dad. By far the biggest issue that we had and it started about 6 months after the symptoms dementia started. It's a difficult one for sure. 

I got rid of all sources of caffeine and used melatonin occasionally and that helped some but it was quite inconsistent and didn't eliminate the problems completely. Certainly keeping him engaged during the day helped as well but that isn't always possible without additional help (I still have a full time job, etc.).
I've just stumbled across this recently. Blue light. All our screens emit a blue light that makes our bodies think it's day time and time to be up, and it upsets our circadian rhythm. Fluorescent lights and some energy saving indoor bulbs are culprits too....i think if the box says ""cool"" it's got a lot of  blue in it. Some people deal with this by getting screen protectors for computers and tv with a blue light filter in them, and for phones as well (some have a blue light filter in the phone's settings) or wearing glasses with a blue Blocker in them. Sometimes the glasses are yellow, and what I have seen recommended is getting red glasses to wear just before bed which triggers melatonin production and telling your body it's sleepy time. Google it. Blue light, circadian rhythm, filters, yellow, red.",2022-03-21 09:30:06,HaroldBAZ,tjbvbh

Dementia,Hell,"If anyone is on tonight my family could use  good thoughts , prayers, vibes etc. My Grandpa (who has vascular dementia)has put us through hell tonight!! He is wide awake,has screamed at us ,tried to get in my parents room where we keep his phone at night so he doesn’t call people after 12am . He’s also mad cause we wouldn’t let him eat his 3rd bowl of cereal at 3am !!! He got so mad he started throwing things in his room. Dad had to take the tv out of there so he wouldn’t break it too ! Now my parents &  I are in our bedrooms doors locked just in case . I’m too wound up from witnessing this to sleep and am praying he goes to sleep and doesn’t call Mom for the thousandth time . FYI he is on Seroquel but it appears to be ineffective. Mom backed out of putting him in a nursing home because she thought he was too frail and would go down hill quicker. Tonight had me begging for her to make this stop by moving him but I don’t think she will 🤬. In case you wonder why I stay here, it’s because I’m afraid it would crush Mom if I left her here with no support . Dad is at his job all day and we only get 20hrs a week of help from the nurse aid . So if I left she’d be on her own . Plus I can’t because I have a broken wrist , no car and am self employed so renting a place is out of the question right now .","I hope your mother will reconsider putting your grandfather in assisted living (with Memory Care) or at least have your grandad’s doc try a different dose and/or different meds. Maybe you could talk with your dad and he could help convince her about moving your grandad to a place where he will get the care he needs and give your family some relief.

Edited to add that he doesn’t sound to frail to me based on his behavior!  Also, he might decline in memory care but he might be OK.  But you need to recognize that with his dementia, he will continue to decline no matter where he is living.

Make sure you and your parents are aware of UTI symptoms in the elderly- they can significantly alter their behavior from their baseline personality.  My mom had dementia and at one point she got a UTI - it was almost like she had a stroke, and she was unresponsive to everyone.  Once she was diagnosed and put on antibiotics she went back to her baseline.  Ensure your grandfather drinks plenty of water.
So sorry to hear that, phoenixgreylee, that's really hard for you all.  I hope things have calmed down a bit & you're able to get some sleep.  I hope your grandpas doctor can adjust his meds, a nice facility can be found for him to live or at least get some respite stay. This is not sustainable.  Really sad for people when the time comes to recognise / admit when it's best they go residential.  idk, it's tough... best of luck!
My experience has been that when they reach a certain point, memory care is best for everyone. Most places will even let you take them home for the day or weekend, provided they are mobile. Just think if your granddad was of sound mind and knew in the future what he would be putting the family through, what do you think he would want your mom to do? Personally I have one son, and I’ve already made it very clear to him that if I have become a burden or danger to myself and others, put me in a home. There is no easy or straight forward answer, and no matter what decision is made there is bound to be a lot of emotions involved.",2022-03-21 03:52:09,phoenixgreylee,tj6f72
Dementia,How old were you when your parent was diagnosed? Should I go away to school?,"I’m 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when i was 17/18. I lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel I missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. He has narcissistic personality disorder so I was also dealing with that abuse at the time. I had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like “you’re the only reason i’m here” all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. This obviously lead me to think if i left he would attempt suicide (which he has multiple times). 

I’m having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. I feel like i’ve made so many decisions based on everyone else’s happiness instead of my own, it feels like it’s been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i’ve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. Some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. It makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. I want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what’s going on with him and help to make decisions. I’ve realized i guess all i can do is give the court my and my fathers truth and at a certain point it’s out of my hands what they choose. It’s hard for these things not to absorb my whole life, it becomes all i think and worry about and i begin to feel so hopeless. 

I guess i’m wondering people’s thoughts on that, whether you’re my age or someone older. Am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? I’ve never left my childhood town long term, i’ve always wanted to. It’s so hard because i want to be true to myself and give myself these experiences, but i feel like i’m potentially betraying my father. Also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer’s at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it. 

I think if my dad wasn’t sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. He always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. Thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts. 

- my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week","When I first started trying to get my wife diagnosed, I was also battling cancer and dealing with a struggling business. My three college kids, wanted to move home to help, I would not let them. A child should not sacrifice their future for a parent.

Since your father is single, your responsibility is to make sure he is in a safe environment. And I would ask your mother for help, not out of any obligation to her ex, but for you and managing your father’s situation.

What is most important to your father is for you to thrive and succeed in life. And the greatest gift you can give him is to go out and do it.
I’m on the same boat. Dad started showing symptoms when I was 17, got diagnosed when I was 18, and I’m 22 now. I didn’t have a solid relationship with him, but I help my mom take care of him as much as I can while going to school 3 hours away. Though we weren’t close, it does suck that he will never be able to acknowledge my accomplishments or see what I have done. He was always very proud of me when I was young, but now he has no idea who I am, can’t form sentences beyond babbling, and doesn’t notice when I’m back home visiting. It’s been really tough living through his dementia and it has honestly put me in bad mental states from time to time. But I think going to college, despite my dad having gotten diagnosed a month before I left, was the best decision for me. It was hard going back and forth between school and traveling home and balancing classes, but I don’t know how I would have survived if I didn’t have something else going on in my life. At college, I had a purpose and something else to focus on besides the shitshow back home. I found an amazing support system that helped me be happy when things were particularly tough.

You would absolutely not be a bad person to leave and go to school. My mom encouraged me to go anyways despite my dad’s condition; she values education and didn’t want something to get in between me and an education. And I know if my dad was of sound mind, he would want me to go too. Sometimes it feels selfish, but honestly, when taking care of someone with dementia, you have to be selfish when you can. Of course not in a bad way, but you have to think of your safety, health, and future first, and take advantage of any moment you are able to choose to do right by you.
Do not feel guilty about wanting to live your life especially since you are so young and you shouldn’t have this burden on you.   

Can your father afford to stay in a place with Memory Care? That would be the best thing for both of you. If that’s not an option, have a long talk with your mom and ask if she’d be willing to be his caregiver while you are in school.  Does he have any siblings that could also help?
Wow, that's been some tough times, dfuqklls, good on you getting through & thriving.  I would say - GO!  Go back to your new school, absolutely.  You're not a bad person, you're not betraying your father.   He always wanted you to do what you wanted with school & careers & expressing yr talents?  You should go, you need to go.  For your life.  You mustn't lose your life to comfort his narcissistic disorder!!

My sibling has NPD, so I can very well imagine the kinds of manipulations & abuses.  So sorry.  Your dad is a grown-up, it's not right or acceptable that he attempts manipulation with suicide threats.  Sorry for him if he feels so badly as that, I hope he can access adequate care, entering dementia it's tricky for therapy.  It's absolutely best at this point I suppose that courts will oversee his care - as you say, give the court your truth then it's out of your hands.  Do not change / stunt your life for a narcissist, that would indeed be a foolish empty life.   You can write him letters (old-style actual paper letters sent thru post, lol) every week / month if you want, to keep him updated & feeling connected with you.

He could go on like this for another 5 years 10 years 15 years, who knows!  Don't set yourself on fire just to keep him warm, it will all end in ashes anyway.    Go, give yourself the opportunity for chances & experiences out there!  Go treasure hunt yourself your best life!!    Probably a deal of therapy too lol - there's a saying - 'most people in therapy are getting it due to someone *else* who *should* be getting it but *isn't.*'  Beware the residuals of brainwashings of narc abuse!!!!  Mind red-flags in other folks behaviour, don't waste time giving bEneFit of doUbT or sEconD chaNcE or whatever.   Out there, *take no shit*!!   Go have the greatest life!!   best of luck!
Please go to school. It is exactly what a parent wants - a happy and thriving child. And a brave one at that!  I’m a mom, twice your age and I would want exactly that for my own kids.  You said it yourself - your dad would want that for you, and made sure you had the ability to use your talent.  You are in no way betraying your dad.  Good luck - you sound like such a great kid.",2022-03-21 01:12:09,dfuqklls,tj456r
Dementia,Rant,"I’m just need to vent. My mom has not been officially diagnosed due to not wanting to etc…the last two years have been hell. Her whole personality has changed. King story short she called my in laws 6 months ago leaving a message I didn’t invite her to a family party I was having (not true) and she wanted to know the date and time. No one called her back for obvious reasons. Fast forward she called them again, yelling at my in law that they never called her back etc.
I do not know how to proceed from here. She is making a fool of herself.","It is the illness that will bring so many different habits that are not so good I see it everyday with my mom I call her a picker and flicker and she has no problem doing right in front of me like I'm not there. 

Its bothers me cause I'm always cleaning up after her all day long and all she wants is her meal! I'm doing the same shit now as when I was a kid I swear I feel so used I feel like all I am is an accommodation  for her needs. 

Being gone for thirty years living in another state and boom she is ill I did not want her in State ran hospital cause that is where her partner was going to put her so she came back home to Calif I have one brother who has nothing to do with her. 

I get tired of everyone telling what a good daughter I am for taking good care of her I just want to punch them in the face.

I no longer work and put into my Social Security I moved away from home my friends my grand kids to take care of her 24/7 and she could care less about anything I have given up all she wants is her meals and her tv.

I am so sorry I guess I needed to get it out you are not alone in this War we will never win.

F&\^\*\^\* Dementia
She can't help it.  She believes the things she says.

You just need to tell everyone that she has dementia and can't help it.

Edit: Can you ask her physician for some medication that may help the aggitation?
Did she forget the invite or was there no party? In-laws might just play along and placate a bit to avoid issues. She’s just confused she isn’t doing it on purpose.",2022-03-20 22:04:51,Acceptable_Box_6236,tj0w55
Dementia,How do I keep my MIL safe?,"My MIL (78f) got diagnosed within the past year with early stages of dementia. Her symptoms started two years ago, probably even before that but it never became super apparent until credit cards got declined due to non payment (beginning of 2021). As time goes on we notice personality changes, and increasing forgetfulness. My FIL says her driving is unsafe, but hard to say how true that is because he's a notorious backseat driver.  I have worked with dementia patients in the hospital, in a memory care unit and in a nursing home. I have really only dealt with the mid to late stages.  I have no idea what to expect as far as a time line from diagnoses until then. I have reiterated to my husband the importance of us keeping her safe.  I just don't know how.  I'm concerned she will randomly wander in the neighborhood. Or get lost driving. Or get into a car accident. I'm also not her actual daughter so I don't know how much say I have in any of this. My FIL handles finances now. When do we take the car keys? What do we expect in the next year?  How do we prepare ourselves? My coworker told me her grandmother with Alzheimer's was found in the neighbors backyard. The neighbors were aware of her diagnosis though, so she recommended we give the neighbors a heads up, but is that too soon? Too weird?","As a Paralegal, I completely get the need to jump in and take charge but I think as the DIL you should probably take a backseat role here. 

Since you're in the medical field, maybe you could speak with your FIL and just let him know you are there for him if he needs help with research and let him know you and your husband would love to look after your MIL one night a week so FIL can get a night off. Bring over some games or whatever she loves to do.  You might want to gently try to steer FIL toward an elder law attorney. If he waits until she's legally incompetent, sorting out the financial stuff will involve court proceedings.

As to progression, I think Alzheimers progresses at different paces and with different symptoms in different patients. Memory loss, losing the ability to perform tasks they have been able to perform for decades, losing more and more ability to communicate, delusions and paranoia. It's a heartbreaking disease.

As to taking the keys, that is a difficult one. Maybe have someone drive behind her and monitor her driving. Have someone put a tracker on her car. In my state, you can report an incompetent driver confidentially.",2022-03-20 22:03:09,Sharbobsqpants,tj0uz8
Dementia,I can't do anymore or go there,"Not that I wanted to -- never trusted my mom's manipulative behavior and speech before she got dementia.  

Now she has not been able to eat -- cancer. She changed her mind and wanted to try chemo treatment.  But the oncologist says she would probably pull out feeding tube, transfusions, and forget what was happening. 

I am now blind and cannot drive the two hours  to see her.  My husband works and it's iffy if she's conscious if we went up. We are raising a grandchild and he's sick right now so we can't bring him nor leave him alone.  

One brother lives close to her and has poa etc.  The other has come to visit her for several days.  No contact w/ me because -- judgmental grudge from decades ago.  

I went for my own neuro exam this week, passed the test (mocca?) but down a bit.  Their comments were ""Well, it's probably just stress, not dementia"".  

This sucks and I wish it was over.","Waaa gosh that's a lot to deal with, life sure sucks sometimes - thoughts prayers and hugs for you littlebiggran, fwiw.",2022-03-20 21:37:23,Littlebiggran,tj0dmg
Dementia,My mom is a klepto,"We have moved my mom into independent living this past year. She is a very VERY needy person. Repeats same thing over and over. 
Make me an appt.
I need yougart.  
I need my cc back. When can I get it back?
I need a sweater. 
She has been taking extras from the dining hall, hoarding food. 
Taking pens from the check-in area.
Taking toilet paper from restrooms.
We found out talking to her neighbor at the facility, she took food containers from the said neighbor. 
She has always been like this though.  This is nothing new. If it is there, she will trick or treat it up like no tomorrow. 
She latches onto people too, doesn't know when to back off. And bothers other neighbors in facility.
She has been diagnosed with alzheimers and dementia. 
Thoughts? Comments.","Oof. If it's an *independent* living place, that's incompatible with dementia. Some places are/can afford to be more tolerant than other places. 

When my parents were in an indy place, it had its fair share of fruits and nuts, as long as they didn't become too disruptive. Some residents had aids who came in from outside the facility, though I think those were primarily folks whose main issues were mobility and ADLs requiring physical strength or coordination. In other words, the body was failing, but the mind was more or less managing.

I made it a point to show up frequently, especially in the last years, and cultivated a first-name basis with staff, keep lines of communication open. Compliments where due, though no gifts were allowed (policy to avoid favoritism or outright bribery, extortion). 

It might be worth talking proactively, openly with the facility's mid-upper management, work with them to see what they suggest. They've been down this road before, might have creative solutions. And her PCP or neurologist may have ideas. 

Still, your mom's behavior might lead them to ask that she be moved to memory care eventually if there is no way to get her under control. Some of the things you list are annoyance. Others are more problematic—food hoarding can attracts bugs, rats… and once they're in it's darned hard to get rid of them.",2022-03-20 19:18:04,ThirstyCoffeeHunter,tixo3a
Dementia,The s**t finally hit the fan,"I’ve always known it’s only a matter of when, but the crisis is now here. 

Last night we were leaving a San Diego restaurant with our daughter and her husband. Being in the back seat she was having trouble with the seat belt and when I reached in to try and do it for her, she started hitting me. At first, I asked my daughter just to pull over and I’d Uber back to their home, but she somewhat calmed down. But I was done. If she was going to continue to refuse to see a dr, I was going to leave her. 

Things escalated over the next hour at home there, including her throwing the tv remote at our daughter. I decided to cancel the next four days of the trip and drive the six hours home the next day. 

In the morning, after some thought, I thought it best to have our son accompany us back to Arizona. I was frankly afraid that she might do something stupidly dangerous in the car. 

Well, that set her off and she refused and said she would just stay in the street, as staying at our daughter’s was clearly not an option.  She also started saying how she would die before going anywhere. That’s when my daughter called the police, aiming for a 72 hour 5150 hold, and a wonderfully professional police team with a social worker arrived. They handled what happened next exceptionally well. 

But after conversations with all of us and their sergeant, they were at least able to avoid the DV route and called for a transporter to a hospital. 

That’s when all hell broke loose with them, as she fought them, yelling and screaming as they were forced to restrain her. It’s hard to describe my feelings during this, as I was just shaking, as we all were. Never wanted it to be this way for her to get help, but not surprised, actually. 

Waiting outside the ER now. They’re waiting for a psychiatrist, but not until she calms down (after some meds that they’ll be trying to give). My daughter, son and I are just waiting. Don’t know who, when one of us can go in, would be the least upsetting. Probably not me. 

Horrible time, and I can’t over express how much love and support is coming from my mid-30’s kids. 

Longest post I’ve ever made here…","Son here. Today was incredibly difficult but I am hopeful this is a step towards getting my mom the help she needs.
I'm so sorry this happened to your family. Consider joining a dementia caregivers support group.  You need validation that you made the right choice.  And you did, you ensured not only your own safety, but that of your wife and family. 

If you haven't yet, start a diary documenting her behaviors. She may turn it around and allege that you are abusing her. 

I hope she finds medication or treatment that makes her safe to be with, but you need to make a plan for your own safety in case medication doesn't help.
As an update, she’s been admitted to the Senior Behavioral Unit at UCSD (San Diego) and they’ve promised a full work up, including cognitive testing. I’m sure there’ll be more tomorrow
Still waiting on the ER status. But what’s weird is that she still has her phone and has been repeatedly and calmly calling me, telling me to come pick her up. Not picking up as I’m sure that would be counterproductive. Did a phone check with the er and they said no change from “waiting for the psychiatrist “. Don’t know why they let her keep the phone, tho. I did ask and they know she has it.
I’m really sorry for you, your wife, and your kids. Your post gave me flashbacks.  Not the good kind. I remember in the early days my wife losing it on an airplane (throwing her iPad, barely missed seat mate; swore I wouldn’t fly with her again and didn’t), storming angrily across kids’ soccer field during a game in front of hundreds of people with our little kids present, walking away angrily from me and our little kids at a mall so the three of us had to chase after her, pushing and hitting caregivers I had helping me, and so on. It was really hard. We found a neuropsychiatrist doctor we liked who we’ve seen for several years now. He helped get meds in place that calmed agitation and helped with sleep. 
Her demeanor improved greatly over time I think due to disease progression though meds still play a role. Has been a long journey I’m sorry to say, but it has gotten easier in some ways. Still a very involved at-home caregiving program but *much* less acutely stressful. Almost never acutely stressful now, really. Still incredibly demanding and depressing, but I’m thankful not stressful and traumatizing (for her, me, even kids, though I ended up mostly shielding them once things became volatile). 
I am sorry and I wish you good luck. It’s a bewildering experience to see someone’s behavior change to be so irrational. Can DM if I can be helpful.
I'm so sorry. You made the right choice. It is in everyone's best interest, including hers, that you are starting to seek outside help immediately rather than wait for it happen again. It sounds like you are surrounded by supportive family but in case anyone ever second guesses you, definitely ignore any criticism.
My wife started this type of behavior a year and a half ago. She had never been violent before. Fast forward thru three trips to the hospital plus my nurse practitioner daughter getting her admitted under the Baker Act (in Fl for those who are a harm to themselves or others). We finally placed her in memory care on Feb 4. Hardest day of my life. Second hardest was the first visit a week later. She's been diagnosed with FrontoTemporal Dementia which certainly jibes with her cognitive decline and her behavior.  I know it's not easy, but for everyone's safety and peace of mind, it might be time to consider placement if that's an option. Sorry. (Edit spelling)
I'm so sorry that you are experiencing this. As an early 30s child who is trying to navigate this situation with my MIL, I just want to say thank you on behalf of your children that you are addressing this issue headon as her partner, and not trying to downplay her behavior. I'm so glad you are able to confront this as a family, and I encourage you to use the time she has during her hold to research options for discharge if you don't think it would be healthy for her to return to your home right away, especially if you think you are the trigger for her aggressive outbursts.
Dementia is a bitch. 

I'm sorry your dealing with this. She's very lucky to have such a loving partner and children.
What a difficult time for you and your kids. My husband has Lewy Body Dementia and we recently went to Virginia from AZ to see his kids. The trip wasn’t too bad for him but it was exhausting for me. 

I think that most dementia patients will have problems being away from home. They can’t assimilate all the new input. She’s probably trying to “keep it together” for your kids which makes it harder. My husband collapsed into bed early every night of our trip. 

I’m in Mesa, AZ. I think Banner still has virtual support groups but my LBDA group meets in person. We have several men in the group - LBD affects 4 times more men than women. I have a few caregivers that I use and now my husband is in a really super day facility. He thinks no one there has dementia, he says they’re all professionals like he was before retirement. 

Please feel free to message me if I can help you in any way once you get back to AZ. 

It seems from your other posts that your wife is heavily in denial. Hopefully this will give you a diagnosis.
I'm so sad for you, but glad that your kids are supportive.  I have no great advice, I'm afraid. These situations are unique to the individual and circumstances.  I hope you can get your wife home safely. I hope you find some peace.

I was sorry to read this for all involved, incredibly difficult to go through, and also share with others as well.  
Sad, scary, frustrating, unfair, grateful, hope...all words that came to mind when reading this, as well as the responses.  
Thank you for sharing and I am hoping for the best for the entire family.  
I am dealing with a very odd, damaging & insane situation with my father that I just caught on to the extent of what the whole reality is, and have been trying to read up on different subjects seeking a better understanding and to pinpoint what disease or mental condition has caused me tons of pain and suffering, and much more.  I am hoping I stumble across things like this that relate as I believe it is partly due to a form of dementia, as well as a few other, and am looking for real help once I can actually nail down what it is that has been the root cause, and if there is support and/or legal means to assist me.  
Mental diseases, or other, are a nightmare and having patience for what takes place, as you know, does not even come close to describing what is needed to help us handle situations with loved ones, but it was a starting word I used in the beginning to help me.  There are now little words to even describe the actual events, behavior, actions, etc, so I get it, and as someone trying to cope with the unknown, and the unwilling loved ones, it is far from hard, it SUCKS...
I have to remember that it is not truly ""Dad"" who is behind all of this, and for some reason it tends to help me deal...sometimes that is.
Thanks again for sharing.  Keep holding it together, sounds like you have a great family regardless of the events and well worth being the super person you are in handling yourself as best you can.  It reminds me that I can continue without acting out the way i often want to and feel I deserve, through love and kindness much more healing occurs.
Best...Paul
Oh my heart absolutely breaks for you reading this. What a terrible thing to have to go through for all of you. I hope they can get her sorted out as soon as possible.

My mother's own violent behaviour raised its head very shortly after my dad passed away so for quite a whil I thought it was coming from her grief. Then the memory problems began to show up more and more. Her own admittance to a NH was because of a prolonged stay in hospital, where they were able to assess her properly, but her situation involves having to take regular medications (which she wasn't) and incontinence (which began as a result of her illness/dementia ramping up a step).  With those two things she was deemed no longer fit to stay at home on her own.

It is so hard, isn't it. Please look after yourself first and foremost because you can't be there for her if you are not able to be there for yourself.
You might find it helpful to view trainings by Teepa Snow.  She has training specifically regarding aggression.

Time for updates - she’s been in the unit since Monday morning and I’ve seen her twice there, once with the psychiatric resident. On Monday she was eerily calm, so much so that I had to confirm that she was still refusing meds. Had no memory about how she actually got there. Yesterday she started getting a bit agitated, showing anger towards our children, who “did this to me”. The hospital has put in for the Riese petition, which will then allow them to medicate without consent. That approval will also start the 14 day extension that would be formalized after a hearing Thursday or Friday. She did finally late yesterday allow a(?) “picture”, which might have been a head CT or abdominal X-ray(might have actually been a CT, too. Not sure yet). Will hear more later. Side note - she has not asked a word about our cats back home in Arizona, and that’s very unusual, as at home she’d be asking about them every five minutes. That’s why I’m thinking a stroke was possible. 

After I speak with them later, it may be time to research placement back home. I do have a good contact for that. 

More later, I’m sure…
Tough day. The Reise petition was granted by the hearing officer, and medication will begin tonight (Olanzapine), so hopefully her mood swings will smooth out. But she kept me out of the hearing and isn’t happy. Now there’s a 14 day extension that will have its own hearing Thursday or Friday. The Unit psychiatrist resident, when asked, said yes, I should be investigating placement after this. My wife told my son and me that if this continues, she would take her own life, something she has said to me in the past, too. 

Also, she is blaming our daughter totally for her being in the hospital, since she’s the one who called the police on Sunday. No amount of talking about safety for all of us would change her. I’m just hoping that time will let that recede into her fog.

And she agreed to a head mri as a follow up to the head CT. The head CT did show brain loss. 

So much to still find out…

Thanks to all of you in this group
Another swing…

Today’s hearing officer rejected the 14 day hold. Basically, she hadn’t actually attacked anyone on the Unit or actually tried to take her own life (only talked about it nearly incessantly), the hold wasn’t justified in the officer’s opinion. 

Convinced her to sign voluntarily for tonight, so now here’s the plan worked out with the psychiatrist - will say we’re driving home with our son, but since I refuse to be alone with her, will just let her in our condo and turn on the AC and leave. I don’t feel safe with her alone. But, in a actuality just drive around the corner to the ER after leaving the Unit. Their triage will be ready to put another 72 hour on her, while we arrange for a facility in Arizona. Meanwhile my friend will scan and send me the POAs from home. Then we’ll either drive her or use a service for transport. This has ALL been approved to do by the hospital, including by their Risk Management department.   

Already have a few facilities picked out in our AZ neighborhood and will start the LTC claim on Monday. 

So much could go wrong with this. Wish us luck…
Today actually went better than expected. Almost went south when the ER wait was about 3 hours while they “readmitted” her back onto the SBU. But since it actually was a new admission, she’s not back in her prior room and doesn’t understand why. Tried to have her understand the hospital works to make it easier in the organization, and not always what’s best for the patient. 

But she did settle down and accept her meds. Third dose of Olanzapine. Hoping for some settling down so we can transfer her to a Memory Care facility. 

Today was especially tough in my kids. Our son was with me most of the day, and my daughter is blamed for all this and calling in cops in the first place. For now her mom doesn’t even want to see her or even have on the call list.
I’m so sorry you are going through this right now.  I hope she (and you) get the help you need. It’s not easy
This sucks. I’m so so sorry.
Wow. I am sorry to hear that. Good news on the professional front with the cops and all but it's tough and it only gets tougher but it sounds like you have supportive family and a good clear head on your shoulders.

Good luck to you!",2022-03-20 16:57:52,barryaz1,tiupsj
Dementia,It’s probably FTD,"Hello. I am a 51 year old woman and I think I am going to be diagnosed with early-onset dementia, probably FTD, this week on Friday when I meet with the Nuero to go over my latest MRI results. I was tested 2 years ago for Huntington’s but the result was negative. My husband and I have been through so much with my previously diagnosed mental illness. I have been given almost all the labels: Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, Schizophrenia, Schizo-affective, just all of them.

Now this extra crap to sling around. I started having bouts of aphasia around 5 years ago, which has progressed to stammering in public so much I’m embarrassed to talk. I don’t go out much anymore, I feel such inertia, and apathy, there is nothing to do that holds my attention anymore. I find that my “words” are disappearing in my head. I can still write but my coordinatnation is terrible. It feels weird to write. My head sometimes just “stops.” The thinking process, then I can’t remember what I just said 3 seconds ago! I cannot follow move or TV plots anymore, I just want to watch cartoons like the Simpson. I sit in my recliner chair in my computer room and just veg for hours and hours watching vids, listening to music, or reading. I can’t do any of my hobbies or online work too. I feel so STUPID! Like a Zombie, just not caring about anyone else or myself too.

Going to do errands is HORRIBLE! I get mixed up in the stores and sometimes go into a fugue state where I don’t know what I’ve bought until I get to the checkout and have to pay for 5 boxes of the same toothpaste. It’s creepy and weird. If the line gets too long I’ll scream out for them to hurry up too loud. I’ll huff and puff and swear too. I never useful to do bad stuff like that before. My husband always tries to calm me down or tell me that I’m embarrassing him in public. Makes me cry but it feels terrible that I feel like I can’t control myself anymore.

I had Covid in the middle of Jan. and it feels like recovering from it has made this worse for me. I feel more leaden, and stupider. I am depressed and anxiety all the time as I feel like I’m loosing what makes me “Me.”

What should I do if the diagnosis is positive? I know how bad dementia can be. How should I get ready? Just do my spouse and I can have a lifeline to hang onto. Thanks.","I'm sorry you're going through this it sounds quite difficult!


Everything you've said is not really indicative of FTD.  FTD is a fast progressing disease and if you had issues for over two years, this would be at a moderate stage of the disease with loss of all instrumental activities of daily living such as cooking, driving, operating a smart phone, etc.  Some more basic things like picking out clothes and putting them on correctly may be impaired as well at that stage.

Severe depression, stress, and anxiety can mimic dementia extremely well and your story fits this fairly well.  It can be difficult to understand that such a deficit could exist from depression/anxiety but it is pretty common especially in your age group. 

If the aphasia type difficulties you started experiencing 5 years ago were related to FTD, you would be at an advanced stage by now (unable to recognize close family members, unable dress/bathe, and fairly and unintelligible speech) or even deceased.

It's also important to note that a brain MRI is not a strong diagnostic tool for FTD diagnosis.  

It's important to have formal neuropsychological testing performed and be worked out by a neurologist ideally one that specializes in memory disorders
   
Misdiagnoses are extremely common in your age range by those less knowledgeable in the medical field. And it would be pretty terrible for you to be misdiagnosed given how worried you are about all this.

Did your mother or father have Huntington's disease?This is an unusual test for a doctor to run without a parent with known Huntington's disease. Do you remember how many CAG repeats your genetic testing showed?  

I would look into the neuropsychological testing as this is a very useful tool!
I agree with Nebb. There are LOTS of other possibilities (many are treatable) that must be ruled out before jumping to dementia. You would probably have much more severe personality changes by now. Like, being entirely oblivious of social etiquette and having no self-awareness about it. Looking at everyday objects and not knowing the purpose of them. For example, failing to remember things that you forgot and someone reminded you about. That would feel like completely new information that you never heard before. You would probably not be recalling all these recent instances and typing paragraphs about it.

How do you talk to someone about regret could've should've it will ware on a soul","You can't ever get the lost time back. Closure is important,  even if it hurts right now. If there is anything to say, say it while you can. If there is nothing unsaid, then say that. Y'all be nice to each other and say what you need to say and get the ""feels"" over with afterwards.
I have the same issue with my brother.  I’ve learned to realize that it’s his loss.  HE will be the one to feel bad after she’s gone.
yeah in the same boat with my brothers. All you can do is be honest with them about how it's progressing and leave the relationship up to them. They're the ones that will have live in regret once my dad forgets who they are....
I am my dad's POA. He lives in IN and my brother lives in FL. Our parents divorced when I was 12 and my brother was 9.

I have had a good relationship with dad but my brother has not. I visit and talk on the phone with dad regularly. My brother does NOT travel so doesn't visit dad and rarely even calls him. Every time I have brought it up, he says ""well, the phone rings both ways"" and then continues to not call. He will usually call only once a year at Christmas if that.

When things started being bad with Dad, he and I talked about what he wanted to do. One of his wants was a better relationship with my brother. He feels regretful that he didn't reach out more. I decided to facilitate that by trying out being ""retired"" in FL (the way I presented going to a MC facility). 

My brother got REALLY angry at me because I said one of my goals for Dad was to help Dad have a better relationship with my brother. I emphasized to my brother that he didn't have to do anything... visit, call, nothing if he didn't want to but... IF he did, I knew he wouldn't actually go to IN to see him, so this way at least Dad was close by. 

It seems to be working. Idk how you can help your brother but maybe just try to make it easy and then he might do the reaching out...? Good luck :)",2022-03-20 14:54:28,SinCity1408,tis0p1
Dementia,A woman who I see most days at the park when I'm walking my dog was being tormented today by a large group of young teenagers. I believe she may have dementia,,"I will start off by stating that I'm based in the UK. Me and my mum take our dog for a walk most days at roughly the same time, and for awhile now we've seen a woman wandering around singing to herself, singing whilst riding her bicycle and constantly hanging around children on the park. We thought maybe she is just a bit eccentric and is maybe one of the children's mum, as she is spotted round them often. She even got involved trying to play football with them once. 

Today however, a large group of teenagers, most of whom we see on the park daily just playing football or cycling around, were tormenting her and taking her dog's ball away from her and wouldn't give it back. One of the teenagers was trying to get it back so that the woman would leave the park. My Mum shouted to them to give it back to the woman so they gave it back to her and she left. Whilst this was happening, me and my mum were observing the situation trying to make sense of what was happening, two of the children from the group came over to us and said that she won't leave them alone and that she's a paedophile as she apparently followed a young kid into a bathroom or something. How much of this is true I do not know. My Mum said she had noticed that the woman was always hanging around them but thought she was one of the childrens' Mum. Most of the group then went and sat down on the grass and a man appeared a few minutes later. We heard him saying that the woman is not well and that they need to ignore her when she's hanging around them. 

Anyway sorry for the massive essay. Im just concerned that this stranger might have dementia or some kind of similar mental illness. I don't know who she is but I'm worried that she will either get hurt, her dog might get hurt as she left it on its own on the pavement when she tried to get the ball back or that she might need some support. I don't want to get involved really as its not my place and I don't know her personally. I just feel sad for her mostly and that if she isn't receiving any kind of support that she may get worse over time.",2022-03-20 14:01:17,WoahLivininDespair,tiquuz
Dementia,"Grandma is hallucinating nonstop, thinks everyone is trying to kill her (TW)","This is more of a vent post... my grandma is 87 and lived on her own up until a couple of weeks ago. She is in good health but doesn't get around well and is 90% deaf in both ears. For the past few months, she had had some hallucinations but they were pretty sparse and inoffensive – like she would hallucinate that there were rats in her bedroom, but then the next day she'd realize she had been hallucinating and laugh it off and be fine for a few more days.

Things have escalated dramatically over the past month. My cousin and her husband went to visit her and throughout the visit she was accusing the husband of stealing things and trying to kill her so he could sell her jewelry and hide her body. After they left, my parents got a call from her neighbor, who said they found her sitting by the road because she'd fallen while running from a knife-wielding murderer. My dad drove out immediately and found her terrified and hallucinating that there was someone hiding under her bed. She refused to go to the ER and they had to call EMTs. They checked her vital signs and checked for a UTI but everything was normal. When my dad got her back home he convinced her to come stay with them.

After my parents got her to their house she seemed to be doing a little better, they had her following a routine, eating on a schedule, drinking plenty of fluids, getting to bed at a reasonable hour. They put me on Skype to talk to her last weekend and she was lucid and able to have a normal conversation. However the hallucinations ramped up again and they ended up putting a baby monitor in her room because she would stay up all night long walking around talking to invisible friends and relatives, and one night they found her frantically trying to leave the house.

Fast forward to last night – I heard from my mom that she was up all night screaming that my parents were hurting themselves and trying to kill her. She'd locked herself in the closet of the guest room and was screaming that she would call 911 and that they would ""never get away with this."" They eventually had to remove the doorknob to get to her, and they found her absolutely terrified on the closet floor. They had to call EMTs to take her to the ER, where they're still waiting now (god bless the USA, it's been like 5 hours apparently).

Anyway, I don't know whether I'm looking for advice or what but I'm just absolutely devastated, both for my grandma and my parents who are suffering through this. They tried an antipsychotic but could not get her to take more than one dose.  They cannot do an MRI because she has a cochlear implant for her hearing loss, and without an MRI I don't expect them to be able to get a diagnosis anytime soon. They live in the rural southwest US and doctors/specialists are few and far between.

I guess if anyone has anything to suggest from experience that might make things easier for her and for my folks, that would be great. If not, then thank you for coming to my TED Talk lol.","There are meds they can put in a topical cream. My dad was refusing meds in his last month's and this helped immensely. At this point keeping her calm so she doesn't self harm (accidently) is probably a must.
Your experience sounds like my grandma almost to a T except she hasn't accused anyone of trying to kill her... yet.

You should talk to an elder attorney.

If your parents don't have guardianship and especially if your grandma hasn't been given a diagnosis then the claims she's making will be more credible to an authority figure. For instance, say she did call 911 and claimed your parents were trying to kill her... it's possible that could reach a court and they decide your grandmother is unfit to live by herself or with your parents and the judge selects an outside 3rd party to take control of your grandmother's welfare and estate.

That's a worst case scenario and not all states have the same laws as it pertains to the elderly.

If you can't get your grandma to take medication that will help her then unfortunately I think the best option is to move her into a memory care facility, but again depending on your state this may not be simple; refer back to what I mentioned about the outside 3rd party. Talk to a lawyer. Her behavior is likely to escalate and it sounds pretty bad already. If your grandmother has money and your parents have power of attorney over her then they can legally use funds from her accounts to pay for a lawyer for consultation - I only mention that because lawyers are expensive, your parents may not be able to afford one, and this is in your grandmother's best interests.
This is so terrible, Im sorry you all are going through this.
Aw, shoot.  So sorry to hear you're going through this, and your parents are going through this, and she's going through this.

Hope they can find a simple reason for this e.g. an infection they somehow missed the first time.

Take care.  Good for you for trying to help your parents any way you can.
So one thought, we got my grandmother to take Seroquel since she was coming off a UTI and she understood that she needed antibiotics to fix the discomfort, and so she just accepted the pills that got handed to her as a batch. You may consider requesting tests for kidney and yeast infection too since her UTI tests are coming back clean. Smart thinking to test for UTI first, that usually is the culprit.

Lorazepam is a med that most people respond positively to but not always. If you can get her to take liquid, that is an option too. We gave morphine to my grandmother by squirting the dose into yogurt or a glob of honey that she just swallowed. Maple syrup or chocolate syrup works too. [Here is a website](https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/resources/locator_tool) that shows you options for Medicaid Waiver to cover a nursing home or personal care aides at home. Try to do as much research for them as you can since you don't have her at home distracting you. 

Sorry your family is going through this hell.
I am so sorry.  This sounds absolutely horrible.  

I think the only thing that will help is medication.  There are some that she can get by patch or  monthly injection.  I don't know which ones they are and if they would work for your LO.
Where I work it is common to get a doctor to okay covert meds and, if it’s crushable, we can stir it in a yoghurt and it’ll be accepted that way.
My grandma was the same until they got her on the medications; still having issues with hallucinations and strange notions like she’s going somewhere with someone when she isn’t, but the meds help. Risperdone, Benztropine, Serpquel (new) and Donpezil have been working for her.
Obviously everybody is different and there are a variety of causes of nighttime hallucinations, but what has worked wonderfully for my family member (who has Parkinson's) is a combination of melatonin (probably the most important part), rutin, EGCG from green tea, and resveratrol. He started having night terrors years ago but stopped with these supplements; last night he didn't take them and he had hallucinations, as has happened on the few other occasions he's forgotten to take them. 

On the other hand, it does rarely happen that people have a paradoxical reaction to melatonin, so you'd want someone to be keeping a close eye on your grandma for a few nights if you decide to give this list of supplements a try. 

I'm sorry you and your family are going through this. It's so unsettling and scary for everyone.
My wife had many of the same hallucinations.  Her doctor gave her Seroquel and they disappeared and her life is back to a more even keel. Hallucinations and delusions are gone and she sleeps 11 hours peacefully at night.  She took Seroquel in the morning, afternoon and night, but is so much better she only needs it at bedtime.",2022-03-20 13:04:32,terehommikust,tipll3
Dementia,Mom having trouble remembering words,"Mom is 76 years old . Is this early dementia, or normal aging ? She knows what she wants to say , but can’t quite get the words out . This has gotten a bit worse over the past couple years. Everything else seems to be good.","I have that problem, and I don’t have dementia. Mine is a side effect of heart medicine. It could be dementia, it could be old age, it could be a side effect. Only a doctor can tell, so I recommend a visit to her pcp. I also recommend you go in with her, and tell the doctor your concerns.
It’s always better to get it checked out. If it’s dementia, she can be put on medication that might help. She can only preserve what she has, she can’t regain what she’s lost.
I work as a registered nurse caring for a number of patients with various types of dementia including other illnesses which can be terminal. It is very normal as part of the aging process to forget words.  I do agree with previous posters that if this is concerning to you, get a referral to a neurologist who can test your loved one for dementia.
My mom sort of did this in her 90s, and it wasn't dementia. She would substitute her first language, German, for English, without missing a beat. ""Pass me the Löffel."" Say *what*? ""The spoon!""

If there are no other concerns, likely it's nothing. But you can always ask the PCP for a check-up.
If that's the only odd thing you've noticed likely just normal aging things. I have problems remembering the words I want to use too. 

Is she independent still ? If so, everything good there ? paying bills, making meals, cleaning etc.
I am a bit younger than your mom.  I was having trouble finding words, especially nouns.  Was put on estrogen and testosterone a few months ago for another issue and those awful moments of grasping for words have diminished significantly. 

My advice. Watch for other evidence of dementia, but don't write off you mom, yet. (And maybe have her hormone levels checked.)
It could be dementia, mini strokes, and just a bunch of other illness. Take her to her primary care and tell them everything and start the ball rolling looking into it. No matter what the diagnosis finding it out early is also the key.",2022-03-20 11:40:06,mikey_likes_it______,tinr9a

Dementia,My husband has recently started swearing he’s already seen movies or shows that have just been released,"My husband has Lewy Body Dementia. Recently, he swears he’s seen a show already even though it’s impossible, it was just released. 

We always watched Outlander together and the new season just came out. He complains that he’s seen it already and so he doesn’t want to watch it. Obviously I don’t force him to watch the show but it’s so strange. 

It’s the same with any random movie. It’s eerie that his brain has suddenly developed this glitsch. It’s literally every single new movie or TV show. 

Meanwhile he watches the same series over and over, to the point that I have to go in a different room. Downton Abbey is a great show but 4 times were enough for me. I think he’s on the 10th round. It’s great for him, it is a “world” where he is comfortable. 

Has anyone else experienced this?","Not with shows but with places they definitely haven’t been before. “Oh I’ve been here before.” “Oh I come here all the time.”
Yes!!OP this is exactly what my mother does...she can watch Colombo and MSR non stop..yet any new movie she already saw it. She wants to go to the movies but I can't find anything that she hasn't ""seen"" already.
My mom was like that but with her it was people. For example we were sitting in a parking lot waiting for my husband to run in and grab a few groceries. A lady pushed a cart in front of the car and Mom started talking about how she didn't know how this woman could be buying so much Coke! She had a couple of 6 packs on the side of her cart. I asked how that was too much and she told me that she buys that many every time she sees her. This was someone that as far as I know she'd never seen before since she rarely was in town. Earlier on the day when she'd been at the hospital getting some tests, an old man who was obviously going to get tests done as well was walking by her and said hello. As soon as she thought he was out of earshot, she stage whispered ""I wish he'd leave me alone! Every time I'm here he flirts with me!"" It has been months since she'd been in the hospital for any reason and I'd never seen this guy before. It's like they are so out of sync with time that three seconds before feels like a memory of another time.
My mom had a phase like this with books. She used to be an avid reader, and then one day she wanted books but claimed she'd already read everything we suggested. We took her to the library and convinced her that she hadn't read the books labeled ""New"" on display in the just-released section, but when she got home she claimed she'd read those too.  

She doesn't read at all anymore, and we've moved on to different issues.
My wife (72) is like that as well. She loves wheel of torture (my name for wheel of fortune) and many times she swears it's a repeat when I know it is not.  I, as gently as I can remind her that it is not and we just kind of move on.  Good luck out there
Yes, the brain gets out of sync with time, kinda like with a dejavú, it feels like a memory as it’s happening except it can keep glitching multiple times and suddenly it’s memories of multiple occasions. Brains also like to fabricate missing details, that’s why eye witness accounts can be so wrong. It’s fascinating and scary and we all do it to some extent.
Yep. Generally what you can do is basically make a statement/request that doesn't conflict with what they are actually saying. 

""I've already seen that""

""I haven't got the chance to see it yet, so I'd like to watch it. You're welcome to join me, or not.""

In a similar vein, my wife is always saying how “they look familiar” and “we were just here”. Hadn’t heard about this behavior until this thread.
Oh yes. My dad has always been a big sports fan (and gambler) . Nowadays we put on a live game and it's ""ugh, why are we watching this again? It's not new, it's recorded. I can tell you every play and who wins"". So given it's March madness, I'm writing down all his predictions to see if he's right. Maybe it's ESP and there is some upside to the evil disease! Now I just need to find a bookie!
In our case, sometimes I think my dad does this because part of him knows he’s losing his faculties and it’s a way to compensate and/or it’s the brains way to compensate, to stay in the familiar, to appear “in the know.” This then reassures himself that he’s fine. But it’s just wild to me, that at the exact same time, if you asked my Dad if he has any health issues, he’d 100% say NO. I see how confabulation is a real thing and that surely is what’s happening too BUT I still wonder….
My husband has early stages of dementia and no matter what tv show, the part in the beginning where they show the recap of last week’s episode, or it might even be the opening credits if it’s scenes from the show. It gets annoying explaining every time that it is a new show and he’s complaining about the credits. He thinks he’s seen it all before.",2022-03-20 06:38:07,58yfailure,tiiavh
Dementia,Somebody that knows about dementia help plz,So my grandma has dementia and i was wondering why it is that she can remember certain things. I did a quick google and understand that it affects short term memories etc but right now she barely remembers her kids (my dad and aunts) but remembered my dad’s newly wed wife so it doesnt really make sense to me. Lately ive been getting into psychology so id like to know for that but mainly if there’s triggers or something we can change so it doesnt keep getting worse or at the least remember her own kids it would be life changing for our family.,"I have found this explanation works for most people: imagine the human brain as a huge double sided bookcase, one side is full of the books that explain everything from how to breathe to how our DNA codes for hair colour. The books on this side are all identical in cover and height with just variable thickness, this means they are nicely stacked and will take alot to dislodge.

The books on the other side contain all of the persons memories, but these books are very uneven in size and shape, due to them being created throughout the persons life and thus the changing influences in their life affecting the books design. The bookcase fills from the bottom up so the last available books are always short term memory and personality. 

Different types of dementia have different ways to attack this bookcase, some search out books on the body side to destroy 1st, some stick to the memory side until much later in the dementia journey. Dementia shakes the bookcase and as it becomes more unstable books start to fall out with short term memory often totally lost early on. As the shaking continues the bookcase beomes more unstable and more books will fall out.

For many people the most recent books are lost 1st, hence why dementia patients often think they are younger than they are, and it's possible for books to become lost in the bookcase, so the memories are still there but access is patchy. 

To answer your questions:

""Right now she barely remembers her kids (my dad and aunts) but remembered my dad’s newly wed wife so it doesnt really make sense to me.""

Some of the books containing her kids have been lost but the book with your dads new wife is still in place, also in the same way that the dementia patient gets younger in memories so can the people around them, does your grandma remember her kids as toddlers/teenagers?  


""Triggers or something we can change so it doesnt keep getting worse or at the least remember her own kids it would be life changing for our family.""

Whilst some meds can slow down the dementias progress nothing can stop or reverse the damage already done, and nothing can change her diagnosis. If you have lots of family photos it can help to have them on display for her to see and remind her of people and events, unfortunately this can also work against you if she doesn't recognise the people in them and becomes angry at photos on display that have nothing to do with her.

I hope I have answered your questions but if you have anymore please feel free to ask.
In my limited experience i understand it like this. Imagine the recall function of the brain spinning round and occassionally memories from different stages of life climb aboard and be recalled. Sometimes only certain stages of life memories can be recalled or random moments of different stages can be recalled.
Hi OP. I'm sorry to hear about your grandma. Dementia is a progressive disease, and unfortunately it never gets better, just worse. What people with dementia remember is kind of random - it's due to damage to the brain (neurons die, connections are lost). Neurons are a type of cell that generally does not ""grow back"". We don't really understand exactly how and where memories are stored. 

But one thing that is well known in medicine is that dementia patients often have damage to the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and the cereberal cortex. The hippocampus is necessary for generating new memories. The entorhinal cortex is a ""highway of information"" between other structures and the hippocampus. It's important for your ""internal GPS"", that's most likely why people with dementia often get lost. The cerebral cortex is important for interpreting all the different signals generated in the brain, and is also where permanent/old memories are stored. 

Other structures are damaged by dementia too, but IMO these three are the most important to explain why memory problems occur.
Different types of dementia attack the brain in different ways. It usually damages the short term memory first and then starts damaging the long term memory. Think about it like this: when you start a fire you can't burn the large logs first, you start with kindling and then move up to the larger logs over time. So the short term memory goes first (remembering where you put the keys, whether or not you brushed your teeth, etc), then the stuff that happened the most recently (deaths in the family, recently moves, retirement, etc), then the middle stuff (having children, getting married, graduating college), then the earliest memories.",2022-03-20 04:21:30,EscapeReasonable6366,tigg85
Dementia,I don't know how to cope with my grandmother's Alzheimer's,"Hello everyone. Sorry for the rant/vent but I just... need a platform of sorts to let some things out I guess...?  


As the title suggests, my grandmother has Alzheimer's disease. It's late stage. I feel like I could just wake up any day now and learn that she's passed away and it weighs on me.   
I'm 19 years old- so pretty young still I would say. I am also a full-time college student and so these things just continuously put weight on me every day. I am so afraid of her passing suddenly and the grief will just completely wreck my school life. I almost flunked high school due to depression and so I am trying not to make any sort of repeat with this newfound ""chance"" I now have. It's conflicting- because part of me feels awful for just ""waiting"" for her to pass away. Of course, I don't want my grandma to die, but this disease has destroyed her so much it's like she's just a physical shell at this point. She is my last grandparent, after all. But at the same time, me internally hoping that she will at least die when I am not in school is such a terrible thing to think about and I feel so... selfish, quite frankly. She's the one with the disease, after all.  
Every week or so, I see her- except it's just a depressing experience at this point because Alzheimer's has taken such a toll on her. I'm trying to spend at least a good amount of time with her while she's still here but it's hard to do so. She's incoherent and does not remember me nor a good chunk of my relatives and requires assistance to do the majority of things if not everything. I'm not surprised at this but it still hurts a bit, you know? Plus, I know she is the only person holding my family together because her children aka my aunts and uncles are in a feud over finances and god forbid what happens after she leaves this realm.   
I've been crying tonight like I do every few weeks nowadays when I think about her. My parents do not know about this. It's just so stressful, and it also feels like I'm looking into the future because dementia runs in my family. My other grandmother also passed from the same disease before I was born. Every time I notice my parents forget something it just sparks a tinge of pain within me because of that fear that they will develop the disease too and I can't really do anything about it. I was also raised in a culture where children are expected to take care of their parents when they're older, so the possibility of me having to be a care-giver myself one day also haunts me because I've seen what it is like and also feel a bit selfish for not wanting to do such a thing.   
I really don't know what to do anymore, or how to even properly cope with something like this. It's a cruel cycle of waiting for her to die so she can finally be at peace and then feel bad for thinking such a thing. Am I a bad person for thinking it'd be better for her to pass away at this rate? How am I supposed to live knowing about this slow and cruel decline towards death my grandmother is facing, and that she's almost at the finish line? I've always wanted for her to see me graduate but I know it is likely that she will be gone by the time I finish any sort of degree. Seeing my friends be able to interact with and spend time with their own grandparents is like a stab in the chest reminder that I will never be able to have such a relationship. I am happy for them yet I can't help but feel... jealous about it. I do have a few very vague memories of my grandma back before Alzheimer's got to her, but I've since long forgotten a good bit of it myself- such a cruel twist of irony, isn't it. I love my grandma very much but it also hurts so much seeing her like this. I am in pure agony.  
Still, if you're still reading this, thanks for your time. Really. I may not know who you are but just know I am thankful you'd put off some of your time to read this. I do not expect a lot of attention and for this to just float around in the Reddit ocean forever and that I am content with. I just want to let some of my thoughts go, and after typing this I think I feel a little bit better. Well, I stopped crying a bit ago at least, haha. Maybe I can finally go to bed.","Hang in there buddy.  Not to downplay your situation in any way at all but I've been dealing with two parents with dimentia for the last two years.  I'm 38yo and I'm the only child. It's by far the hardest shit I've had to deal with in my life.  They both were at my wedding but don't remember it.  Just had my first baby a year ago and they both ask every day if it's my kid.  I also struggle with depression so I can somehow relate.  There's nothing we can really do to make the disease stop and I'm just starting to learn how to live with it.  It's fucking brutal.  All I can say is take pictures/videos. Record a phone conversation while you can.  You'll want the good memories while you can still grab some but it's going to get rough watching your loved ones fight the disease.  Talk to a therapist if you can afford one or look into something like that.  That really helped me in some ways but hang in there buddy.  It's a crazy journey and it just gets harder every day.  Just show them love, play music, videos of things they used to love to do and little things like that have helped me bring back life into them.  You'll get through it. Wishing you and your family luck.  Fuck dimentia and fuck alzeihmers. Pm if you ever want to chat. Sorry for the rant lol. A ton of people are in our shoes.  We all need each other brother.  ❤️
Don't feel guilty for anything you feel. Dementia is terrible, it's harder to deal with than cancer, it's cruel and completely unfair. It's hard but keep visiting, you'll be glad you did when she's gone. Vent here any time you need to. We've all shed tears over loved ones with this horrible disease and understand your pain.
From a former English professor. Took early retirement when one parent became ill. Then the other parent needed massive infusions of help. Both died. Then Covid. Now partner diagnosed with dementia after many years of so-called mental health issues.

Talk to your professors. We're human too. (Most of us.) Nobody will be in a position to give you carte blanche on deadlines, all assignments, readings, etc. A class is a certification that you have attained mastery of the material. You cannot pass if you haven't shown mastery. Offer or negotiate a plan for completion of missing work if you fall behind—and follow through on that plan. 

If you stumble, or a crisis emerges, begin again. Meet them halfway, keep them updated as needed, and show you're in earnest. We don't tend to throw up our hands unless a student makes and breaks promises repeatedly, pulls a vanishing act, and then resurfaces 2 weeks after finals asking ""what can I do to pass the course?""

Look into your university's counselling and support services. Support services will be starting to get stressed at this time of year (if you're on semesters rather than quarters), with final exams approaching. A dirty little secret about academia: universities are getting more and more demand for student mental health services, especially since Covid, and most have not kept up with staffing and resources. In other words plan visits now, rather than waiting until you're in urgent need.

Find or organize a support group for students who also have loved ones with illnesses. See if your counselling office can make referrals to community-based support groups. Or perhaps a hospice organization in your area will have in-person or online support groups you can join. Join a meditation group. 

It's hard not to be distracted by anticipatory grief. Know that your grandmother would want you to excel in your studies. If she could tell you that, she would. Ask r/MomForAMinute for encouragement. There are some pretty lovely grandmas-for-a-minute there too. 

It sounds like your family is contributing to your distress; they're going to do what they're going to do, whether you try to intervene or not. It also sounds like grandma is in a safe place and receiving care—so many young folks are struggling to get financial and logistical mechanics of care in place, so at least that's off your plate. 

And you're always welcome here for a good, cathartic howl.
You say that you are in education. In some ways, that is a very supportive environment. Please reach out to the mental health support that is provided by your institution. They will have professionals that can support you much more than the internet can, and they will also be able to help you receive reasonable adjustments if that should be necessary. 

There is nothing wrong with your feelings, but you may be at risk of depression. A professional will be able to give you a diagnosis and propose steps to help.",2022-03-20 04:17:24,yuseok,tigea3
Dementia,Breaking point,"My mom has Parkinsons and Lewy Body Dementia.
She has several panic attacks daily and now has started screaming out in pain at night along with the panic.
She also yells several times each night for help.
She was recently in the hospital for 2 weeks and they checked her completely out.
They couldn’t find anything that could be causing the pain.
I care for her about 60-70 percent of the time and am at a breaking point.
If you could share some of the difficulties you’ve encountered with your loved ones; I’d really appreciate it.

I NEED this community, especially right now. Thank you all so much for being here and sharing your stories.
It really does help to not feel so isolated.

Dementia and Parkinsons are such cruel terrible diseases. I get so angry that my sweet beautiful mom is suffering so much and there’s nothing I can do.
I feel completely helpless.

Sigh, apologies for the rant.
I guess I just needed to vent somewhere and knew this was a safe place for that.

Thank you everyone again. I’m so grateful for this little safe place and for the support.","I can understand how you’re reaching a breaking point. Were the doctors able to medicate her for the panic attacks? People can have panic attacks in their sleep as well. 

My husband also has DLB with Parkinsonism. The disease seems to be attacking the visual regions of his brain. He recently got new glasses with a noticeable correction but his brain doesn’t process the correction so he complains that the glasses aren’t working. 

I don’t know much about the brain but it seems that your mom is accumulating alpha synuclein in regions that cause panic or pain. Idk even know if that’s possible. 

Ativan is often prescribed for something like this. It’s terrible for their brain but it’s all a balancing act at this point. 

Are you active in r/Parkinsons? They might have some suggestions. There are a few doctors that frequent that subreddit.
OMG, so sorry you and your Mom are going through this.  There seems to be no end to what this disease does.  I can't imagine the pain you feel having to witness her pain.  My husband has the same disease but has not progressed to such a difficult stage.  I hope you have support around you so you can continue to help your Mom.  Thoughts are with you.
I am having similar experience with my dad. he is taking donepezil but not having much effect on panic attacks. He seems to believe that most people (including people on TV) are either trying to kill him or rob him. Horrible disease. Is your mum on any meds?",2022-03-20 04:06:56,Torvabrocoli,tig9cg
Dementia,I'm 30 and I struggle to remember the previous day.,"Sometimes even the first half of the day. Not sure if this is the right sub. Grandma on my Dad's side passed away with dementia, Dad is fine, otherwise nothing else within the family that I'm aware of.

Most online publications reference early symptoms in 50s 60s. Should I be worried or am I overthinking it.

Note: I feel like I've always had really good memory, up until about a year or two ago.","Did you get covid? One of the long term symptoms for some people is brain fog.
Stress, anxiety, and depression can also cause memory problems.

Either way, it would definitely be worth your time to check in with a doctor to see if they can figure out what’s going on.

You're overthinking the dementia part, however several more common medical conditions can cause your issues. See a GP. Don't self diagnose.
Age 30 would be one of the earliest recorded cases of Alzheimer's, even early onset.

Go to the doctor and get bloodwork done. If your vitamins come back fine get a referral to a neurologist. It's probably something fixable.
There are things called deleriums that mimic dementia but are treatable. It's more than likely something like that. See your doctor.

Dementia,"Grandma with Alzheimer’s broke her arm, keeps taking cast off","My grandma, who has been suffering from Alzheimer’s for a long time and in her late stages, broke her arm badly around 10 days ago from the bus doing an emergency stop.

My grandad is her main carer and is severely struggling as it is. After being admitted to hospital, they found she had a severely broken bone and she got a cast put on. She initially didn’t understand why she was the only one with it on (delusions of persecution) and started getting very angry. My grandma has now managed to take her cast off around 4 times and every time my grandad has to wait for hours (we live in the UK) to get it put back on. This is the 4th time tonight. She can’t remember falling, she believes that it is the cast that is causing her severe pain. Every time this happens me and my mum have to drive an hour to go help my Grandad because she gets very angry at him and he needs support. She shouts and gets very very aggressive. 

This is not sustainable and I don’t know what we can do. My Grandad is very reluctant about admitting my Grandma into hospital or getting an in-house carer full time until it is fixed because he’s very old fashioned and thinks the husband should do it all. I tried to find advice online for people with dementia/alzheimer’s who got a broken bone and I can’t find anything.

Has anyone ever experienced something similar(‘?","There are casts you cant take off.  There are disadvantages tho.  I was told it can irritate the skin which might not be good for seniors.  Id ask her doctor for options.
My mom had to wear a knee brace after a bad fall and kept taking it off. Nothing we did worked. She was also combative. We had to just deal with the fact that she was going to take longer to heal and it may not heal properly. It sucked but a permanent cast was not an option for her injury. If you can get a permanent cast that would be ideal. If not you may just have to let it heal improperly.  Not ideal, I know
Does she need more pain medication since she thinks the cast is the cause of the pain?
Perhaps ask if they can extend the cast over the elbow so that she will have a harder time removing it?
My mom did the same with 2 casts lol
Her fractures never healed properly but in the end the doctor said it wasn’t worth it to keep reapplying if it bothered her so much.
Sorry, don’t have advice, but you’re definitely not alone.
Sometimes you just have to laugh or else you cry.
Take care
My mom broke her arm, the doctor thought she'd be fine with a splint and ace bandage. Sitting there in the hospital with her and she was covered up to her chin and she started saying something was caught on her gown. She'd completely unwrapped the bandage under her blankets and the plaster splint was catching on her gown. The doctor wasn't thrilled with coming back in to put a real cast on it but it served him right since he had been warned she wouldn't leave the bandage alone when he was telling us beforehand what he planned to do.",2022-03-19 18:08:51,Legitimate_Dot_7157,ti674z
Dementia,Ethics of taking away checkbook,"My once-frugal 75-year-old mother, diagnosed recently with dementia, has made many donations to various political candidates and other random charitable causes over the past 18 months. She has been financially scammed numerous times over the past 18 months, in one case giving out her social security # over the phone. She insists that her money is her money and she can afford to make donations and she can spend her money however she likes. It is true that she is financially secure and technically can afford to make these donations but it is awful to see this money flying out the window when it will soon be needed to pay for her care.

She receives stacks of fundraising solicitations in the mail every day, spends hours looking at all of this mail, opening the envelopes and putting paper clips on various letters, putting Forever stamps on the return envelopes.  If my sister and I do not secretly remove some of the mail while she is not looking, it piles up in stacks and she begins writing more and more checks. Currently there are hundreds of pieces of mail covering her entire dining table and is piled up on chairs, in boxes, etc. If she catches us taking it, she gets angry at us.

Today after I picked up two full brown bags of unopened fundraising mail from her home, I discovered I had also accidentally picked up her check register, which apparently had been left amid one of the stacks. 

My sister and I are both POA for all finances including on her checking account. When she discovers the check register is missing what do I do? Do come clean and tell her I have it and she can no longer have it? Do I pretend I don’t have it? Do I return it to her?  She is increasingly making incredibly poor financial decisions that are absolutely out of character for her, however for now at least she is still paying bills on time and is not always so impaired that she might not figure out that I am likely the reason her check register is now missing.","We have the same problem with my MIL. Our answer was she has two checking accounts. One is where all her funds are deposited. My SO, her durable medical and financial POA, has access to this account. It pays all the bills. She has another account that he places a set amount of money in each month that she can spend, if she goes over the limit then her card is shut down. When she asks what's wrong with the card, we let her know it is because her SS check hasn't deposited yet. She quickly forgets this and life continues on. She no longer has access to checks due to scam/fraud issues. She tends to just pull $200 out in cash at a time and then spend it like it's going out of style. We had to curb her spending, because she absolutely cannot afford it. To avoid constant fighting we employ therapeutic lying as suggested by her therapist. It allows us to keep her financially secure, provides her a certain amount of autonomy, and keeps the nasty fights down to a minimum..
Is there anyway to stop the fundraising letters from getting in her mailbox? I'm thinking either you arrange to pick up her mail from the post office, or forward it to one of your homes while you sort through them and request them to stop sending the mailers.

Regarding the check register -- is this the checkbook? So right now, she's not able to write any checks without it? Has she mentioned that it's missing? If she hasn't, I wouldn't bring it up. Is her bank aware that your POAs have been triggered and that mom can't make financial decisions for herself anymore? You should let them know and give them a copy of the POA so they have it on file. If you have documentation from her doctor saying she is mentally incapacitated, give them a copy of that document as well.

Where possible, automate her bill pay so that she doesn't have to handle money anymore.
I slowly took all the check books out of dads house. I made sure he had about $40 cash in his wallet. Had to take his keys, on and on. 

Don’t feel bad about protecting her by not allowing her to be scammed
Both my mom and dad did the same thing. We had to have ( in their state) two medical providers deem them incompetent to  handle their financial affairs. I hated doing it but caught my mom giving personal information on the phone to ""publishers clearing house"" stopped her before she could give them her banking information. You have POAs already- that's half the battle. She needs to understand that in the blink of an eye, her life savings could be gone if she's not careful. We eventually had to take away internet capabilities for the same reason. Hard to do but necessary...
Whatever you decide, change the addresses for every single thing to your address or a po box. And do a formal change of address form through the post office as well.
You might be able to use a small lie, something like ""your bank doesn't use checks any more, they'll send you a debit card to use soon"" then kick the can down the road with ""I don't know why it's taking so long"" until she stops asking. 

That's the system we had to use to get my mom to stop driving... ""Doctor says you're not healthy enough right now, you have to wait until you're better"" then any time she asked we'd tell her she needs to talk to the doctor the next time she's in. She'd forget to ask when we were there.
Good luck stopping the mailers.  My mom passed away late last year.  For the solicitations that have prepaid postage, I’ve repeatedly written “deceased” and asked them to remove my mom from their list. Every week I get the same junk mail.
I was in exactly the same position with my mom; tons of solicitations in the mail and she read every single one and dismissed me like I was an idiot when I told her they were scams (those scams are targeted directly to the elderly too, threatening social security, giving her tons of crap to read and 'opinion' forms to fill out). Luckily my mom was frugal too, so only sent out $10 or $15, but it was adding up to about $100 a week. Also, she was too deaf to talk on the phone and eventually couldn't use the computer either. I was driving by her house and stealing mail out of the mailbox, it felt so wrong.  

It's ironic that you're wondering if it's ethical to take your mom's checkbook to save her from these completely unethical predators. I think you should do what you have to do to protect your mom whatever that involves. Caring for a loved one with dementia puts us in uncomfortable positions about so many things. I hope you and your sister are on the same page, because supporting each other emotionally means a lot. My mom is in assisted living now and the junk mail is still rolling in at her house, those people are real fuckers.
I believe you have a moral obligation to shut this down, especially with scammers EVERYWHERE.

She has the dementia diagnosis.",2022-03-19 17:36:56,apatheticpurple,ti5is4
Dementia,The Fourth Visit...,"I live in Las Vegas, my mother is in Georgia.  

This is the fourth visit. My mother and I had no relationship, and now we do. When she started calling me last summer and saying things like, ""God Bless You"" I knew things were serious.

This visit I came out to see an attorney and get Advanced Medical Directive, Power of Attorney, and a will done.  That happened yesterday afternoon. After months of telling me she had an attorney to see but could not find the name of the person and all she needed was, ""to update the will.""  After fruitless searching at her house for the existing will, at the attorney appointment she said she had never had one done. 

To be perfectly frank (the whole point of this post) I'm bored sitting here and a bit exhausted. The attorney appointment was a big step. It's done. The will and other forms are simple. And now the formality is after it's prepared and I've seen a draft to get her to actually go sign it. 

I suspect it will be another $450 round trip just to ensure she goes and signs it. 

Mom just asked me why she hasn't heard back from the attorney and she isn't sure he's any good.  It's Saturday and like I said...met with him yesterday afternoon. 

She needs the TV on constantly, can't stand having ""no noise"" yet she's never paying attention to it and wants to talk to me constantly. I'm a fairly quiet person and get distracted easily (ADD) so it's irritating...always was. There's a lot of old feelings coming back especially this visit. 

We've had the conversation 8 times at least today about me getting a copy of the will. When her mother died she didn't get a copy of a different will she wasn't aware of until two months after my grandmother died.  The house that was to go to her was already sold and she has no idea what happened to any of the contents of the house. She doesn't want that to happen to me. So continues to repeat it despite me repeating the attorney is going to email me a copy in draft and in final form.

By the way, that isn't what happened with my grandmother. The will part is true, but the house was sold with my mother's participation. She got the net proceeds from the sale. 

She needed help getting back on online banking since her bank was bought out and is transitioning over to a new Website. She continues to ask if she needs new checks because they say the old bank name on them and if the checks are going through because she doesn't know. 

I look at her check register. She's perfectly balanced the checkbook and is marking when every check she writes clears. 

She just asked me to help her get back on the computer so she can she her bank account because she doesn't know when her retirement and SS money comes in. We did that yesterday too.

And another thing bothering me. The notion of ""get her to a neurologist"" that well-meaning friends are telling me isn't QUITE that straightforward when you live across the country, or even when I'm here.  She claims she will find one and I don't need to worry about it. I've finally (this visit) gotten the name and information for her PCP which I told her I will make an appointment with to get a referral to a neurologist. 

I contacted four neurologists around the Atlanta area that I knew I could at least take her to. Three are not accepting new patients, one is ""not that kind of neurologist."" 

But I don't have to do that, her cardiologist said he would find a neurologist for her.  The same thing she told me in November...","Watch out for paying random amounts on bills and not balancing the checkbook.  Make sure you know her passwords, especially the online banking.  And I hate the TV too; on loud all the time.  We've been to a neurologist and neuropsychologist multiple times.  Doesn't help since she's not that bad (""mild cognitive impairment""), even though she can hardly remember anything more than a few minutes.

Can the attorney send the will out with a mobile notary after you've reviewed?  Would she sign, or would she need you there?
UPDATE: “A few months ago” my father’s “third or fourth wife,” called my mom at her home to talk about how awful my father was. They met in Texas and she explained how awful my father still was, that he’d cheated on her and still had a terrible drinking problem and that’s why she had divorced him. 

My parents have been divorced for 29 years, five years longer than they were married. 

My father has been married to the same woman (his second wife) for the past 18 years. He has been sober at least 11. He lives in Texas, yes, but met his current wife in Georgia. 

These types of fabrications have always gone on. And the continual talk of how awful my father was is another constant. There’s also a lot of hatred to me for still keeping in contact with my father.
Oh sure, it’s frustrating. It probably won’t reassure you to tell you that your mother’s brain is very dysfunctional and it’s only going to get worse. 

I doubt that your mother could see a neurologist on her own. Even if she did, she would “showtime” and present as better than she really is. At least, you can look into arranging transport for her to an appointment. My city has a Paratransit system for people who can’t take public transport. 

There are only three categories of dementia, mild, moderate, and severe impairment. That makes it a bit deceptive.  My husband is mild to moderate but he can’t be left alone safely. 

I don’t see how she’s living alone. Is putting her in a home an option? 

Take a deep breath. This whole situation sucks big time. You’re doing great by getting the legal stuff settled.",2022-03-19 16:40:43,SmoothJazz98,ti4bwy

Dementia,I am so tired of judgmental people!,"Slight Rant 

My grandmother is 91 and was diagnosed with alzheimer's last month, but we have noticed her having memory problems for several months. She is a stubborn independent woman, but she had to move in with my parents because she couldnt live by herself. She soon started to forget who they were. She has also forgotten who I am (her granddaughter), and most of her family. Her alzheimer's is progressing and it got to the point where my parents couldn't take care of her. It also became dangerous for her to be in their house; she has fallen several times, she thinks my parents are strangers and would become paranoid, she would open the front door and leave it open, she would turn the stove on and forget to turn it off, etc. 

My mom and my aunts found a nursing home that can take care of her since her alzheimer's is getting worse by the week. She was admitted last week, and so far has been fine. The problem is all of her friends started judging us for putting her in a nursing home! These people haven't even been around my grandmother like we have, never came to visit to see how she was doing, and now they want to us to take her out! My grandmother is also narcissistic, which has made her alzheimer's even worse and her friends are her enablers. 

Today her ""friends"" went to visit her at the nursing home and they told her that they're gonna take her out, so she can live with them in another city! Her friends never told my family they were going to tell her this, and now my grandmother is excited because she thinks shes leaving the nursing home.My family went through so much to diagnose her and get her the proper care and these people think they can judge us and do better. They are giving her false hope and promises, and making it worse. My mother was so angry this  morning and had to have a phone call with these ""friends"" of hers and told them to mind their damn business. 

I'm just disgusted by how judgmental everyone has been!!

UPDATE: 
My aunt had a stern conversation with her ""friends"" and they did apologize for telling my grandmother she can leave and for not believing her alzheimer's is getting worse. Unfortunately this morning the nursing home called and said my grandmother packed up all of of her bags and was sitting in her room waiting for her friends to pick her up. She told everyone she was leaving, and my mom had to break the news to her...","I am so sorry for what you are experiencing! That is the LAST thing a caregiver needs when trying to get appropriate help for their family member. Have any of her friends volunteered to take care of her (I mean REALLY volunteer)? Unless they have walked in your shoes they need to butt out (maybe giving them the opportunity to host your grandmother....even for a weekend...would give them a healthy appreciation for the changes she has gone through). My MIL tried to cook something on our gas stove (maybe toast? Not sure there were just charcoal bits....) in the middle of the night when we first cared for her. Scared the crap out of DH and myself. We remove the knobs before bedtime now when it’s our turn to care for her. Rant away- this is the place to vent about palm-slap-to-the-forehead situations!
Sounds like her friends need to be placed in a home too if they think they can override the family and kidnap their friend. 

Tell the home about these people and let them know about her ""friends"", while it would be horrible to not allow her friends not to visit causing this sort of problems for your family is a no-go. 

Also don't worry about being judged by idiots.
Oh no.  OH NO.

Your grandmother's friends are either entirely deluded, or heartless.  Yes, I know it's hard to accept that their friend is genuinely deteriorating (in part because that ties into their own aging), but they are being **actively cruel**.  Cruel to your grandmother, and cruel to your family.

This is not acceptable.  Not even close.

Your mother (and/or aunts) needs to have a ""[come to jesus](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/come-to-Jesus%20moment#:~:text=Definition%20of%20come%2Dto%2DJe,James%20Hamblin%20%E2%80%A6)"" meeting with them where your mother tells them exactly what's going on.  Everything you mentioned above.  She's fallen several times, she forgets to turn off the stove, she forgets who they are, she's a real danger to herself let alone others.  Don't hold back: be blunt and direct.  Don't spare anyone's feelings.  Show them medical diagnoses if you want.

And let them know that by raising false hopes for your grandmother, they have been cruel to her.

Then, there's two or three options, which you should discuss with them:

1. They change their mind and accept what you say, and can continue visiting your grandmother as her dear friends, and they never say anything about ""taking her out"" again.  If and when your grandmother brings it up, they have to tell her it's not possible -- WITHOUT throwing your family under the bus.  They brought it up, they deal with the consequences.

2. If it's even possible -- invite them to take your grandmother home for a weekend.  Call their bluff.  No, a week.  A weekend might not be enough time to realize her true condition.  If they're not willing to do so, then they need to shut the f up about how she shouldn't be in the nursing home.

3. If they can't change their mind, they have to be told that they're not welcome to visit your grandmother any more.  Obviously everyone wants them to be able to visit your grandmother, loneliness is very real, but if they can't understand that they're being cruel to her, they can't see her any more.

This stuff is not negotiable.  I feel bad for your mother and aunts.  Getting your grandmother into a nursing home was a difficult decision for them, and I'm sure they agonized over it.  People with dementia by their very nature don't recognize how much help they need and how dangerous they can be.  If your grandmother's friends can accept that she needs to be in the nursing home, they are friends.  If they can't, they're not.

Source: I went through some of this with my sisters, who couldn't accept how far gone our father was.
One of my grandma's neighbours, who she was friendly with would help out with some stuff occasionally, started causing a fuss when my mom and I started to talk to grandma about giving up her driver's license.  Saying that she was fine and not forgetting things, etc., even though the neighbour hadn't really known my gma that well before she started to show symptoms so didn't notice much difference.  Eventually when we did convince her to give up her license, the neighbour helped a bit with grocery runs, etc when my mom was working and I couldn't drive yet, but it came out that the neighbour was letting my grandma drive HER car without a license and had been a little bird on my grandma's shoulder telling her that her family was being overprotective and controlling.  There was a big fight out in the driveway about it with the neighbour acting like she was trying to protect my grandmother from her family. 

And after all that, when my grandma's symptoms got worse, and the neighbour promptly stopped caring or visiting her. 🙃🙃🙃
I've cared for enough people with family/friends who have piss poor insight into the individuals condition. Want to know what happens every single time they request a discharge and take them home? The person ends up an emergency admit to hospital when reality hits that they've bitten off more than they can chew. All it does is leave their loved one even more scared and confused as they are stuck waiting for another long term care facility bed to open up. Then comes the process of trying to re-settle the individual into a new environment all over again. It's so damn frustrating for everyone involved , most especially the resident and I sincerely hope you make it a point to share this observation with her friends. While I realize that they have no ability to discharge her without having POA it might be a way to help curb their commentary to some extent.
The only good thing about dementia is she will forget what she was told soon. Distract and change the subject. 

You can take those “friends” off the visitation list.
I recall my aunt’s concern that Grandma D (living next door) who was struggling mentally. My Dad who lived in a neighboring state didn’t want to believe. That Christmas my boyfriend (now my husband) and I picked up Grandma D for a visit at my Dad’s house over the holidays. THEN he understood. The next month she was moved to a nursing home with better managed overall care.
That is horrible!  I am so sorry you are going through this right now. It’s hard enough to deal with dementia that having ‘friends’ like that make it so much worse. Plus how disappointed is your grandmother going to be when she doesn’t end up leaving!? I would be furious!
Sorry to hear this. This is sad because they likely don't know her like you know her. She might even forget by the next day, which in your case is fortunate, which sounds unfortunate but really, at this stage, it's better she doesn't have the excitement.
It's one thing or another isn't it? My Mom is afraid of being in a Nursing Home and the more I learned about one the less I liked them. So I took the brunt of my considerate and compassionate decision and I have served my now 90 year old Mom a retired social worker with a 175 or 185 IQ and has had undiagnosed dementia for over 2 years. I think as far back as 6 years. I'm not sure but that's a hell of a mental disease. I am adhd so that doesn't fair well with dementia and I have a very good memory at the age of 54. So good that I've been criticized for looking back or remembering the past that was good and bad. Well life sure isn't sunshine and rainbows. Its no bowl of cherries and getting old sucks. Yes I know about judgmental people and no offense but its nothing knew. I was judged by toxic friends or even my relatives in some form or another. I tolerated it like a man but I'm no pushover. I am vindictive and I'm pretty  darn smart. You can't judge a book by it's cover. So you have my sympathy. I do believe there are a number of people out there that aren't that judgmental. I'm a Caregiver for my Mom and I have the upmost respect for the Sons or Daughters doing what I'm doing because it has almost taken the wind out my sails. It is very mentally challenging and I have the Caregiver stress to boot.
Friends and other social connections are usually the last ones to realize how bad a person's dementia is because they're around for a short period and the person can usually hold it together for a short visit. Friends who are in the same age range act like they do because they're scared for themselves. Older folks seem to believe that magically somehow everyone should be qualified to be a caregiver and take care of family members in their home. My mom was like that with my grandparents. She took care of her dad, literally sending my preteen self of to stay with cousins who took me in but weren't happy about it any time grandpa was in the hospital. She left my ill father to fend for himself most of the time when my grandmother got dementia and needed care. It was like she thought it was her absolute duty even though she had 6 siblings. She acted like she'd completely failed when Grandma needed more care than she could give and had to be put in the nursing home.

My advice is give it the attention it's worth, which is none whatsoever. Opinions are like buttholes, everyone's got one and some really stink. Your family did the right thing.
Op... please check with the facility as to who is allowed to ""sign her out"". At one my dad was in, friends could take a person out to lunch or something. I saw several times people taking their friends out of the facility course they brought them back and I don't know if they were on some kind of list for that person or not but do double check because all they did was just sign a little book on the way out the door at the front desk.
But will Grandma remember what her friends said? If she's as you described, she has forgotten already.
Just to check…they can’t actually take her out of the nursing home can they? Like you have protections in place with the administration saying who is allowed to take her out? I’m not 100 % sure how it works but I was thinking of when I had to pick my friends child up from daycare I had to be added to the list of approved caretakers and show my ID. Do nursing homes do that? Also…have you talked to these friends to let them know that they are making her unhappy by promising something they can’t deliver?",2022-03-19 14:26:32,salugo000,ti1ggg
Dementia,dad's dementia getting wose and refused food..,"Hi all, 

Brought dad to geriatric psychiatrist last week and doc said his dementia is getting worse. He completely lost the apetite to eat, and would only obliged if my mom grind all the food to bits and feed him. I believe he has lost his ability to chew.  He could still talk in clear voice and seem to be able to engage in simple communication. His weight is now 38kg, down from 45kg before he was diagnosed with mild dementia after a  fall last year. He became bed ridden for 2 months last year due to that fall but has since recovered and can now walk, albeit slowly, but he prefer to stay in bed whole day. 

Appreciate if anyone who has gone through the same thing with their love ones could share what i should expect in the coming months... i would like to be prepared mentally as much as possible.

Thanks all.","[deleted]
How old is your father?

As people age they do lose their appetite but perhaps you could supplement with protein shakes?  Caution, some can cause diarrhea.  Yogurt might be a good protein option. 

As my mom further declined (she passed at almost 88), in her last month she lost interest in eating, probably due to inability to chew and swallow easily.  Staff puréed her food and she would eat yogurt and applesauce.  But eventually she wouldn’t even eat that.
Perhaps doctor is hesitant to mention hospice as an option. You may need to raise topic first.
We just put my dad on hospice on for the same reason. Tons of support from the whole hospice community, also hospice used to be a death sentence years ago but that train of thought has changed quite a bit, he gets a lot more daily visits from his hospice team(spiritual, physical and mental support) he is still barely eating, but has a ton of support and he is still drinking ensure, which I think is keeping him going but I know he is headed towards the end of his life.
One more thought, in my experience you have to bring up hospice to the doctor. They are unlikely suggest it first. Perhaps they are afraid that you may be offended, or that you would blame them for making the patient worse after they suggested it.
A SLP (Speech-Language Pathologist) who can assess Dad's ability to swallow may have some suggestions, & certainly calling in Hospice for a consult are a great place to begin. My Mom, after a lifetime of loving her veggies etc, has morphed into a bit of a sugar fiend. This is not uncommon, but when she is reluctant to eat, we have tried to play on her newfound love, & I can mix anything with some strawberries & she will drink it as a smoothie. We've blended in some veggies/fruits with Ensure & Greek yogurt & she will take that when she turns her nose up at everything else. 100%, have Dad assessed & based on their recommendations, you may have a better idea of what it makes sense to do next. I'm so sorry that you're having to navigate this. I know how treacherously difficult it all is. Xo
how are his teeth?  maybe he has a dental issue?
My mom has difficulty swallowing at times to the point we’ve had to make her dinner into a sort of smoothie.
Perhaps difficulty swallowing is part of his discomfort with eating?
From what you’ve posted it reads like your dad is in the terminal phases of dementia. If you would like additional support I recommend asking your dad’s doctor if they can provide a referral for hospice. Hospice is more of a philosophy and then a place and can be provided at home or at a facility.

Dementia,ANONYMOUS SURVEY ON NHS SOCIAL PRESCRIBING SERVICES & PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS HEALTH AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 18-25,"SURVEY CLOSING ON TUESDAY!

5-10 minute survey on Health and NHS Social Prescribing Services.

*Open to those aged 18-25* THANK YOU!

Social prescribing is a form of non-medical intervention that is being used in the NHS by healthcare professionals with the aim of enhancing people’s wellbeing.

The aim is to provide practical and emotional support as a way to help improve their wellbeing, rather than using strictly a medicalised approach when the reasons for ill-health may be partly or wholly due to psychosocial reasons.",,2022-03-19 07:37:12,Nadisha_Choudhury,thtdpn
Dementia,How to 'take care of yourself'?,"My wife has early stage dementia.  We have no friends nor family.(Her family is in Maryland; we're in Florida.) I have untreatable bipolar illness.  Irritability is part of the illness.  I'm irritable most of the time and the irritability bleeds into caring for my wife.  I feel bad about being short tempered or annoyed and vow to myself to do better but the next day, there's my irritable self waiting for me.

She's not at the stage where she/we need help, yet her short term memory has worsened over the past few months and I'm her memory.  All the advice for caregivers is to take care of yourself.  What does that look like?  There's a geriatric clinic near us but she doesn't want to go for another evaluation.  She still has awareness of her situation and family history of dementia.  She also has poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, which she tries to manage by eating less; she actually eats very little throughout the day.  I'm watching her slowly die.  How do you take care of yourself when you're always in the frontline of the war?","Every time someone says they’re irritable but don’t need help yet, I think or say that yes, they do need help. Try to get her in a day program a few hours or days a week. I was very frustrated with my husband and that melted away when I got help.

Edit: I think also better to introduce help inside the house or outside earlier on if the person with dementia isn’t resistant. That gets them used to it and there may be less issues later on.
If you're frustrated to the point of being irritable to your wife then you DO need help. Your mental illness needs caring for too. Don't underestimate how stressful taking care of others can be.
And it’s OK to “compassionate lie” to try and get her to the doctor, respite care (some assisted living places offer this “daycare” or even overnight if they have beds available), or other types of appointments. 
Before I learned that term here on this subReddit, I told my mom white lies as to why she had to go to assisted living - “you need to stay here a little while to help get you better recover from your illnesses.” My mom actually did have a very treatable breast cancer and other minor health issues, so it was easier to convince her it was a “short term” situation. 

I agree with 58y, try respite care, or ask family and/or friends to help you a few hours a day a couple times a week.
I'd say, take the time to do something selfishly. 

One approach is to literally do something that ""only you"" want to do. Just go out and be by yourself and do what you want to, for you. For this one, do your best to avoid guilt-tripping yourself -- it's your time, your experience, refill yourself (one cannot pour from an empty cup), be thankful for the time. 

A second approach is to mindfully frame what you're doing as ""for you"". For example, if you're eating a meal with your wife, pre-game and tell/remind yourself ""you"" want to eat this meal with her. ""You"" are giving yourself the experience of being with her. ""You"" feel better when giving her a piece of yourself. Prepare a ""this was for me"" checkbox and check it off as you go. Be as honest to yourself, as you can, in this mode -- Avoid feeling like someone else pushed this on you. If you feel like there was some other way you could be doing something for yourself, remember it for the first approach.

Godspeed and happy travels.
Hi, OP. I notice that you say you want help for *you,* but then much of your discussion centers on what you can do for *her.*

I am not bipolar, but probably have some shadow Asperger's floating around in my hereditary mental makeup. I too get annoyed, a ""don't suffer fools gladly"" mentality, although having a definite diagnosis of dementia for my life partner has helped me understand more clearly what's happening with her, what I can do, and what I can't do. 

One area I've been exploring for many years that helps: Buddhist mindfulness. Please know I am not pushing religion. Rather, offering a source for attitudes, understandings, technologies for coping strategies that can bring peace and patience.

In a nutshell, we are not our bodies, or our minds, or our emotions. Meditation can offer an opportunity to watch your own mental processes, and place some distance between what you *feel* and what you *do* about those feelings. (Meditation is not about stopping the mind from thinking, but about choosing what you attend to in the mind.)

A teaching I've found very useful is Eight Verses for Training the Mind. The Dalai Lama has the 8 verses and a meaty explanation here: https://www.dalailama.com/teachings/training-the-mind

If you want another route or do not have access to a meditation center, I'd recommend anything by Thich Nhat Hanh, either books or online.

Thank you for your compassion and skillful self-insights.

I just had a conversation with my husband about being primary caregiver for my mom. I told him I feel like I’m not trying hard enough, I get so frustrated with her, and it’s hard to hide. He reminded me I’m still dealing with my dads death (been 6 months), I’m just in the beginning of my career and have a part time job, and have my first baby on the way. We’re dealing with a lot. It’s ok to ask for help. Asking my sister for more assistance was the best thing for me. I hope you find something that works for you.
Put child locks on the oven, hide anything that could cause a fire, put on her favorite movie and go golfing with your buddies.

Read up on childhood trauma, CPTSD ""the body keeps the score"" and see if your childhood may be related to your bipolar and her childhood to her dementia. Try to be mindful of your mood and avoid others when you're irritable and meditate.",2022-03-19 07:08:39,Tropicaldaze1950,thsz9n
Dementia,External catheter or other option to reducing peeing at night,"My dad broke his ankle.  He has a walking cast boot but we dont want him walking at night cause hes groggy and unstablw on it.  And yet he needs ro pee 3 times a night.  

So far, weve been staying with him to help him walk but i think this is impossible to keep up cause we qre exhausted.

I was thinking he could wear an external catheter instead.  Does anyone have any experience in these?  Is this a goo or bad idea?","Have you considered a bedside commode? I see them at thrift stores all the time. Then he only needs a couple steps instead of a whole walk.
Try a handheld urinal. You can buy them in the majority of pharmacies. Just have him sit up at the side of the bed to use it. A commode is definitely a great idea to have close by for bowel movements  but a urinal would eliminate unnecessary need to transfer back and forth when he just needs to empty his bladder.
There is something called a condom catheter but they are not very successful to stay on. A urinal at the bedside is best. Second would be adult depends pads.
How about restricting his fluids?  Don't let him drink anything after 4PM, that should cut down on his need to pee during the night.",2022-03-19 05:53:46,heehee63,thry0a

Dementia,Dementia or Something Else?,"I’m worried about my mother. She can’t remember the most basic things. She asks me the middle names of my children, names of family members, birthdays, etc. This seems like the early stages of Alzheimer’s. 

What is more alarming to me, though, is her obsession with things. I’m not sure if it’s related to Alzheimer’s and I want your opinions. 

For context, if it’s relevant, She’s on Klonopin and has been for 20 years. She doesn’t take it at the same time each day and often skips some to “save money”. 

She OBSESSES over stuff. For example, if an app she has resets and she loses her ability to login using Face ID, rather than a password, she will spend HOURS trying to fix it. 

When she asks me a question and I’m speaking with someone else, if I don’t immediately answer she will say “SAY” or “HELLO?”

She needs IMMEDIATE answers to text messages or she will send 8-10 at a time. 

She leaves hateful voicemails if I don’t answer the phone. 

She is rude to the waiter / waitress and doesn’t “read The room” or follow social cues. 

Are these all signs of Alzheimer’s or something else? Thank you for your help.

Edit: She is 67 years old.","My mother’s experience with Klonopin was horrible.  Doc prescribed it to help mom with her anxiety and it made her much much worse. She became enraged at certain points.  I asked doc to take her off it and try something else and her behavior wasn’t as bad.

Are you able to talk to her doctor to suggest that her medication be reassessed?

You don’t say how old your mom is. 

She could have OCD as well.

You or her designated advanced health care person should talk to her doc to get evaluated and/or get a second opinion.

Dementia,What to do,"My wife is in the final stages of dementia and has only recognized me fleetingly the past few weeks. I seem to be the last memory she is holding on to. She's in a residential care facility and in the past few days she has declined rapidly to the point the hospice nurse believes she only has a few days left.

She had a minor stroke today and didn't get out of bed at all. She is on morphine. I went to visit her and just got back home a few minutes ago. While I was there she was in bed with her eyes closed and her mouth half open breathing shallowly. I sat with her and held her hand and just talked with her, telling her stories and remembering times we had together. A few times, when I asked her if she remembered, she squeezed my hand lightly. After a time she closed her mouth and seemed to fall into a deeper relaxed sleep.

She is a short distance from me so I went home but I wonder... should I go back there tonight and sit with her all night or should I try to get some rest and go back in the morning. On one hand I'm eventually going to get exhausted, more than I am, so some rest would be good but I do not want her to pass away alone...

The caregivers at the home said they would call me if there was any change and I could get there within a very few minutes.

What do I do?","I suggest you get some rest and trust they will call you if you need to return tonight. There are no guarantees, of course, but it is important to take care of yourself.
Your caregivers should be able to tell you when she is close. They will use words like ""transitioning"" or ""active"" to mean she has begun the dying process. 

&#x200B;

I am so sorry. There are no good answers here. It sounds like she knows you love her, and that she loves you. Whatever happens, cling to that. And may the time you have with her always be a blessing.
The hospice staff will be able to tell you when the time has come to stay. Rest. So sorry 🙏
Dementia sucks
Our dad died from dementia at home on hospice 

Our hospice nurse always said to be kind yo ourselves before she left 

You have kept your vows and she knows you love her. Take a bit of rest
Thank you.
You need rest, I'm sure she wouldn't want you to run yourself into the ground. The hospice staff will let you know when it is time, take care of yourself.
This sucks. Your wife has a great partner. Stay strong and just talk to her while you're with her.
I’m so sorry for what you are going through. 

As others have said, there are signs that hospice will look for.  I learned that when my mom passed. 

My sibs and I played her favorite songs, held her hand and prayed.
Also ask if she “rallies”, that you be called. There is something called terminal lucidity, where previously unresponsive patients rally for a few hours or a day just before they die. My mom did this but she didn’t have dementia. She was able to say her goodbyes.
compromise,  can they set you  a bed up next to hers so you can rest and be there?

If not,  get some rest and be ready to go when they call.

I am so so sorry you are going through this, I hope you aren't alone.
Sorry for your loss. they will be able to tell when she is in the last day or so. The breathing pattern changes from being merely shallow to something called the ""death rattle"". A very distinctive sound that sounds like snoring and gargling at the same time. This sound indicates the final 24 hours or so. we witnessed it caring for my grandmother in home hospice before she passed 10 days ago. 

you may consider bringing over a CD player and plugging it in and playing it for her with her favorite music so that she is feeling some musical energy sent from you, when you are resting.",2022-03-18 21:38:02,HFrappa,thklri

Dementia,Is there a step-by-step guide or how-to to dealing with this?,"My mother (70) is showing some pretty textbook signs of middle to late-stage dementia, maybe Alzheimer's (her father had it). Memory loss, confusion, going to take a walk to the store without telling anyone (sometimes getting lost), getting constantly scammed, personality changes, that sort of thing. She still showers and feeds herself just fine, but she clearly needs help.

She won’t go to the doctor, doesn’t even have one in her current state. I do have financial POA, but not medical. She only has social security (no other assets and no savings), so I’ll have to cover any other costs of her care. She has Medicare (maybe, it’s unclear), but not Medicaid (and I understand she’d need a diagnosis, which I can’t get if she won’t go to the doctor).

Her sister and brother won’t house her anymore so I’m trying to find her a place to live in my city, but I’m so overwhelmed and not sure how I can afford it. My area is super expensive and one month of care at memory places (and even some independent living) is more than my mortgage.

Is there a guide for all this? I have so many questions, and probably more questions I don’t even know of yet, and I’m at a loss as to where I start. Do I need a lawyer? A new job to pay for things? Can I make a doctors appointment for her and drag her in against her will?

What do I do?","[https://www.alz.org/help-support](https://www.alz.org/help-support)

If you get a referral from a GP, you should be able to schedule a telehealth visit with a geriatric psychiatrist or some other specialist that can help diagnose dementia (or ""mild cognitive impairment""). They can also prescribe drugs that may help delay progression of symptoms (the way I heard it described was giving them more, better days). You may also need to shop around. It's frustrating, but the first psychologist we took dad to was useless. Dad was confident enough that his answers ""felt"" right to her, even though they were factually incorrect/he got timelines wrong/etc. So we had to keep looking until we found one who could actually sit down and talk to him for a while to figure out what was going on.

I would talk to an estate planner or elder law attorney to see about setting her up as a ward of the state. Her care could be managed by a state social worker with more resources available that way. People WILL try to stonewall you and tell you no resources are available. We basically got no support from the state until dad attacked mom in a rage one morning and we had him taken away in an ambulance for psych eval. When mom told the hospital staff that she wasn't going to take him back home because she felt unsafe, the hospital got a case manager and social worker to jump in and help find long-term care placement for dad. Suddenly resources were available that we hadn't been told of before.

Keep your head up and *take care of yourself*. Burnout is very common in caregivers, especially when your loved one doesn't understand or respect the work you put in to giving them care. Take time to do what you need to stay sane.
So sorry you are facing this. The prior poster gives excellent advice. Highly suggest the book “The 36 Hour Day.” Tons of information and advice for family and caregivers. 

Some states have good caregiver programs, the Alz Association or social worker should be able to refer you to options in your area. Also can’t recommend a support group enough. Wishing you the best.
The book named “the 36 hour day”
Many communities (via the Public Health Nurse?) have assessment teams who will show up and evaluate someone like your mother, to help determine what her needs are (and whether there may be community programs, daycare, etc. for which she'd qualify).

Dementia,Has anyone had dementia family members receive an MRI more than one time (beyond the initial dementia diagnosis)? What benefit would that provide?,"My MIL has dementia (diagnosed in 2013), and her care is shared between 3 households. My household has observed declines in her cognition that is disputed by other households (they claim they don’t currently see the behaviors, but admit to past situations where the behaviors happened under their care). The PCP wants an MRI (not sure why) but a social worker from the medical group indicated an MRI is unnecessary since MIL has already been diagnosed with dementia. Has anyone else had more than one MRI recommended for their dementia family member?","My Mom is 92 and has had multiple MRI’s her neurologist explained that they do that to track progression and see if any other issues developed that they would normally catch with behavior changes. Because dementia alters cognitive functions they can’t always tell if something pops up with a diagnostic. Listen, your MIL is loved and obviously has people invested in her care. You guys are doing great!
The MMSE screener could be used to chart decline. At some point it becomes useless because they can’t really understand enough to answer questions. 
MRI’s are often done more than once to help determine the amount of damage causing the vascular dementia.
This sounds like irrelevant to your case, but my mom moved around a lot during her MRI (she had bad scoliosis) and they suggested we get another scan as a follow up
You are correct in understanding that her care is shared between 3 family households (her 3 surviving children) on a rotating basis. She has multiple health needs (she is 89 and also has type2 diabetes and hypertension) and does not qualify for medical- the cost of memory care facilities is out of our collective budget, so this is the best albeit not ideal solution for providing her care. Not sure what your solution involves but the palpable judgement is not helpful.
In cases of vascular dementia MRI can be done to see any new development. 

Also, what do you mean shared by 3 households? If I understand correctly you're making her move houses which is not okay. Please discuss this with her doctor and take the correct measures.
Personally, I don't see the need for multiple MRI's.  Dementia is a progressive disease, what would having another MRI prove other than the dementia is progressing? She is 92, what is the expectation?  I agree with the Social worker, unnecessary.
Regarding your original question. For a patient who is nearly 90, I personally would not put her through an MRI especially if she is somewhat claustrophobic and will find it scary because she doesn’t understand it and it doesn’t change anything. I would see an MRI helpful if it was for a patient who was much younger for example wanted to get on SSDI rather than claiming Social Security early/before full retirement age (or they’re too young for Social Security).

She is more likely to experience an injury that gets her hospitalized which accelerates the dementia. To focus on the progression of dementia at her age is putting the cart before the horse. For a 90 year old,  I would find it more important to focus on preventing falls and injury. So keeping the physical environment clear of tripping hazard is important. and to try and mitigate delirious episodes (prevention of UTIs is key here) which can increase risk of unsafe activity and injury. At which point the injuries and illnesses basically spiral, when you treat one you make another worse.
A dementia diagnosis in 2013 would be very advanced by 2022.  This should be an advanced stage where things like wandering, inability to recognize close loved ones, getting lost trying to find the bathroom, inability to use the bathroom or bathe adequately, and be unable to do simple tasks learned in the first years of life occur frequently. 

If your mother is in an advanced stage an MRI would probably not be necessary.  But it also wouldn't hurt unless it would be an ordeal to get her to complete the MRI.

However, if she doesn't seem to be drastically worse than she was in 2013 then it would probably be a good idea to see if there's any noticeable structural change.

A much easier thing to do would be for her to have a Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) completed if there is any question of her diagnosis. It's a single page short memory assessment that is better than the mmse but should ideally be given by someone trained in doing it.  Typically with 9+ years of dementia, a score of around 0 to 3 would be expected.",2022-03-18 14:28:36,38willthisdo,thbqxg
Dementia,How do I prepare myself and my family?,"I think I might end up with dementia.  We have a HUGE family tree. 
 In the history of that tree, there's one instance of Alzheimer's that lead to death, and random mental heath cases including one in my immediate family.  For each of us in the tree, it's like Russian roulette when it comes mental health issues in varying degrees.

Not sure if ADHD would lead to it, but I prefer to know and be prepared.  Going to states or countries that allow death with dignity is an option that I considered.","Alzheimer’s is a neurodegenerative condition, it’s doesn’t mechanism operates like ADHD or psychiatric disorders. 

If your parents are in their 50s or 60s, consider purchasing a long term care insurance plan BEFORE they get any diagnosis.

If your parents have ADHD and begin showing symptoms outside of their baseline, you may want to bring them to see a doctor - *especially* if they deny any problem at all. There are some conditions that cause similar symptoms but can actually be treated. Menopause for starters.
I think the best way to prepare for a possible future of dementia is to do 2 things. 

1. Live the healthiest life you can. That means exercise as a part of your daily life, eating right, and avoiding unhealthy habits such as smoking, drinking alcohol, or using others drugs recreationally. For eating right, consider a whole food, plant based diet. Yeah, you may miss meat, eggs, cheese, junk, but that is way easier than 10-15 years of dementia.

2. Get your financial world in order. Live below your means. Don’t use debt. Pay off any debt you have, including your house. Amass as much wealth as you can (hello, retirement accounts) so your family doesn’t have to worry about how to pay for your care.",2022-03-18 10:50:46,sayaxat,th341o

My mom is almost non-verbal but will occasionally mutter words (usually repetitive or unrelated). 2 weeks ago we were trying to finish up dinner (we have to pass her each bite) so my fiance and I were facing her. Out of no where she stops, looks up toward the ceiling and very sure-of-voice says ""What?"" 
My fiance and I both went pale and looked at eachother, we were thinking ""well shit is this is? Is she seeing the light? Is she talking to Jesus?"" We turn to look and for some reasons one of the kids is standing on a chair (shes very tall already) with her arms up like she was basking in some glory lmao
Mom was looking at her also confused why this child was on the chair haha we laugh-cried 😅
My mum has dementia which is developing and (finally!) under investigation to work out what and why, so I have been following this sub and trying to learn ideas, thanks for all posts. 

Anyway I went to the supermarket, shopping with her. She passed me 2 packets of adult diapers, then turned and started walking away as fast as she could -absolutely trying to make others think I needed the diapers not her. She still has her sense of humor at least some of the time.",2022-03-18 10:02:17,magnabonzo,th21ld
Dementia,Recommendations for bed/mattress,"My dad is starting to struggle with getting out of bed and we were thinking of getting him an adjustable mattress. Something that would also help elevate his legs and feet at night. Did anyone here upgrade their loved ones bed? If so, what did you choose? I'm struggling with where to start in terms of research.","When you say he’s struggling with getting out of bed, do you mean he has difficulty getting out of bed independently or do you mean he is getting out of bed independently and you’re worried he will wander/fall/etc?
I got an adjustable bed right off the bat. I found a new one at a good discount. The only problem is that if his legs are elevated at night, you or he would have to use the remote to lower the legs or he will have trouble getting out of bed. Usually they are sold with a foam mattress. Get a thinner mattress, maybe 10”. My husband has trouble getting up onto a higher bed and crawls in on his hands and knees. This seems to be common among dementia patients. 

My friend who has a different issue installed a vertical grab pole to help him get up.  However your dad would need the upper body strength or assistance to use it. 

My dad had those guard rails and he could use them to pull himself up as well but he didn’t have dementia. 

TBH, I only buy adjustable beds. I like them myself.
I have one on my dads bed. He gives it 2 thumbs up. Has not fallen out of bed. Gives him so.ething to grab when he stands up and uses it to get to a sitting position",2022-03-18 04:20:37,crabblue6,tgwiu9
Dementia,Questionnaire about Dementia,"Hello, I am a grade 11 student and as part of my Design Technology course I need to complete an Internal Assessment (IA). For this, I need to think of a problem in the world, research it and create  a product in response.

My chosen topic is dementia, which is why I am on this forum. I want to get some input from people who have first hand experience with dementia/people suffering with dementia, to help me specify and narrow down my area of focus.

It would be great if you could take the time to answer a few questions; it is completely anonymous and should not take too long.  [Link to questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTFpjYt9HE611faBJZ4mkC7kVBv1jXyXY-_809sIpTAhPivg/viewform?usp=sf_link)","Done, I hope it helps.

Dementia,Mommy is always uneasy and crying,"Hi everyone, may I know if any of your dementia patient relatives are always like this? My mom is becoming worse everyday. She would complain that she cannot breathe. We already went to the emergency room to have her checked, everything seems normal. Feels like she's using it as excuse to get out of the house. Once we get home, she will complain again, but whenever we tell her that we will be going to the mall later on, she will calm down and settle. Then after a few minutes, she will be so uneasy, she will keep on walking and crying saying she can't breathe. It is a little bit embarrassing because we live in a 4 storey apartment building with shared terrace, and whenever she walks out to the terrace, she is always agitated and crying along the hallways. And she gets easily mad when we ask her to get back in and then will suddenly cry, I'm afraid of what the neighbors would think seeing this scenario. When we tell her that we'll be going out to go to the hospital or to the mall, she will again be okay, then if everything keeps quiet again (because my sister and I are working from home), she will again make a scene either inside the house or along the hallway terrace. Our apartment is along the road and many commercial establishments in front, so basically a lot of people seeing my mom like that. We tried to contain her but we also suffer because we can't do our job smoothly. Also, it's every minute like this. What can we do to manage this behavior? It is becoming so alarming because at times she would yell she wants to die then points a scissor at her stomach and heart or sometimes attempts to jump to the terrace (we're on the 2nd floor). It's really frustrating and lately, I feel that this is also taking a toll on my mental health. We live in the Philippines. I don't know which organizations to turn to. I don't think thee are dementia organizations we can reach out to. My sister and I feel so helpless. 🥺","So sorry you are going through this. Frequently dementia patients have trouble regulating their emotions as the disease continues. Can you contact her Dr or Neurologist and let them know of these symptoms? There are medications which are helpful with these issues which can help to calm her. It does help. I know it is very distressing and I truly hope you can get some help to assist you all. 

Also, I found this: https://www.alzint.org/member/alzheimers-disease-association-of-the-philippines/

Wishing you peace and comfort friend.
It’s very common that they feel like “something” is wrong, so they have the urge to run away from wherever the current place is, because walking away seems like the only thing they can control.

Does this usually happen in the late afternoon, evening, or night? if so it is called sundowning. you can take some steps to prevent it like having her take melatonin, calming music, herbal tea, taking her on a walk to tire her out, ideally before 4pm so she is already tired before that time strikes.
Also whenever there is a sudden drastic decline and new crazy behavior, she should get tested for a urinary tract infection. You can even get little test strips in bulk for use at home so you know when you must take her to the doctor. UTIs are very common among senior women with dementia and it makes the dementia 100 times worse but it can go back to baseline with antibiotics.
I am so sorry about this. It is very tough. Sounds similar to my mom. Maybe mediation will help. My mom is not currently on medication because my brother, who is her main caregiver, don't like it. But I don't know how long we can go on like this.
Hopefully that organization is as helpful as the Alzheimer’s Association here in the US is. They refer to available programs and services, and offer support groups for caregivers.

Dementia,Nothing could prepare me,"I’ve read and watched so much about dementia and stages and common traits, but nothing could prepare me for watching my grandma interact with a stuffed dog the way she did today. I brought it to her and she was so excited but I had to choke back tears as I played along with her. This is the first time I’ve felt that she isn’t my grandma and it’s scary.","When I volunteered at a nursing home, many of the residents (mostly women) would hold and cuddle baby dolls so lovingly. In a way it was heartbreaking, but it brought them genuine joy, and it was actually very pure. For people in need of so much love and care to feel as though they were giving love and care--I'm sure it was healing to them. It gave them a little autonomy and an important job to do.

Of course, I didn't know them in their previous lives, so it wasn't as sad as if I'd known someone as a person who could cook or repair a roof or teach a class or do surgery and then saw them holding a baby doll as if it were real. That would have been hard. But with that emotional separation, I really did see it as kind of a beautiful thing underneath it all.
It is scary, but I hope you find that eventually you can embrace it. For the past few years (pre and post my mom’s diagnosis) my mom has been obsessed with little white dogs. Loves them so much and wanted/s one so badly. Someone from my support group brought over a baby doll, a Raggedy Ann doll, and a little white stuffed dog. My mom loves them, but especially the dog. When she’s upset, I’ll bring it over to her and you can just hear the relief when she says “oh hi, baby” to the stuffed dog. It comforts her, and I’m grateful for it.
The well goes very deep, it's possible she was craving affection but was unable to express that. The idea of ""dog"" does that to everyone, but maybe moreso when it's hard to say what you need, or to initiate a hug. Was it just that she was so into the play that she kind of wasn't present?
This makes me wonder.  As our dementia love ones progress do we forget to give them loving touches and hugs and cuddles.  We are doing so much for them, all the things they have trouble doing by themselves, do we get caught up in the care giving and forget how much physically touching them in a calm and loving way can mean?  In my own life I think that may be true.  I take care of my husbands needs but have not actually sat next to him and held his hand or just given him hugs during the day.  Something to think about.
My dad had dementia at times when I would visit him he would say that he was waiting for god to come for him and this was before that I noticed he had dementia. He had told me at one time that we start off as babies and we go back to that stage.

What he told me was all true and at the end I was helping mom bathe and change him. He was a reader and he read many books and at the end he was not happy having to be changed and bathed. In his own way he knew what his fate would be and I now know what mine will be like.

Both mom and dad had already planned a funeral and had made all the arrangements. Mom is still with us and she says she is ready to join dad.

I will also follow there example and plan out my final resting place so my sons will not have a difficult time with this.
Yes but she is your grandma and this can happen to all of us.  It's called being human.
I'm sorry you are going through this. Your actions clearly brought her joy and that is a special thing to do for a family member. Sending hugs.
Hey I don't have anything to offer except that I went through the same thing. We fought the idea for so long because it seemed ridiculous and insulting to her, but one day someone brought her one and what she you know? She loved it. From then on, we had to accept where we were and what was going on. The only silver lining was how happy it made her. At least she was still able to enjoy herself even if she previously wouldn't have approved. I compare it to growing up in reverse. The milestones are similar and if you accept it, can be a sweet way to connect and eventually say goodbye.
My mom has a doll too... we buy different outfits for the baby, play, talk to, place her in nursery (when it's time to change my mom, she's bedridden now)... the baby's name is Mary... lol... it's great fun!",2022-03-17 22:46:13,emetophobiamama,tgrc2v
Dementia,alz/vascular combo?,"Hi all, my mom was diagnosed a year ago with a combination of moderate vascular dementia and moderate/severe alzheimers dementia. She had a concussion 3 years ago which may have accelerated things, on top of living alone during the pandemic. She had not been engaged in a lifestyle that would have created a lot of cognitive reserve (no exercise, brain teasers, or new experiences, just reading novels and watching tv).

I wish I knew how long she has. This week a year ago is when I helped her move closer to me and I was shocked to realize how impaired she was when I finally saw her in person. She started Namenda and moved to an assisted living facility. She's happy there, participates, has friends, is stress free, but has definitely deteriorated in the past year. In the past 6 months, she is not enjoying going out to eat as much, doesn't want to be away from her apartment for more than an hour or two.

Is there any point in wondering how long she has until memory care, until she's nonverbal,  until she dies? Or is it all so individual there's no point in guessing?

With the one year ""Surprise! It's dementia."" anniversary, I guess I'm feeling contemplative.","I wonder the same thing all the time  - how long until memory care and how long overall. My Mom will be 85 later this month and is just moving into assisted living. Her mother had similar issues and went into a facility at 85 and eventually passed at 93.

Admittedly, I'm trying to plan so her resources last, which makes me fret and stress all the time.
I apologize if this sounds harsh but it is very hard to tell especially with combined dementia but I would be very surprised if she has 10 years. She could live longer but based on b your description of the deterioration that would be my max. I'm glad she is still maintaining a fair quality of life.

Edit: for clarity, I mean 10 years max until advanced alzhiemers.
Everyone is going to be different 
Our dad died from dementia. When he was diagnosed we decided when he was not able to live alone, we would rotate taking care of him at home, there are 5 of us. We just didn’t know when it was going to be “time”. During a polar vortex winter a few years back, he locked the screen door going outside. Fortunately a neighbor saw him pried the door open and called me. My sister moved in that night. We did round the clock for 2 1/2 years. He didn’t like to be away from home, his comfort zone. He went on hospice 04/28/21 and passed June 5th. He quit eating about 2 weeks before he died",2022-03-17 15:27:30,Call00hCallay,tgi3u6
Dementia,Vascular dementia??,"Hi everyone! Sorry if my wording may be wrong just had a few questions about this disease. 

My father had a second brain surgery a year ago to remove a benign tumor pushing on his pituitary gland. He is only 55 years old, sadly during this second surgery he had a massive stroke. He was in the hospital for about a month and has short term memory loss now and is a completely different person.

This has been a very hard thing to cope with and his next MRI is coming up on March 29th which will tell us what the neurologist thinks is wrong. They wanted us to wait a year to see how my dad is healing wise and sadly he seems to be getting worse, he doesn’t remember anything we said 5 minutes ago and he’s also gotten angrier lately and always thinks he has to go to work at a paper route which he did when he was 12.

My mom is his primary caregiver but us kids help out a lot aswell, I’m thinking that this is what he has because of all of the symptoms and how he is still declining. He is also on a strict diabetic diet because he has type 2 diabetes.

I’m just looking for advice for anyone dealing with these things and how to cope and if this is what he could possibly have? Thank you","I would say wait until the 29th to know exactly.  
My mom has vascular dementia but dad had a similar decline to what you describe  6 years ago following a Intracerebral hemorrhage stroke. He is doing better somethings got better..the 5 minute memory loss got better...the speech got worse..etc.
All I am saying OP. Wait and see. Symptoms do vary. I hope recovery for you Dad. Update us and take care of yourself in the meantime.
I send you positive juju. And send you a virtual hug
I waited 3 years to seriously press Doctors… big mistake.!!!
After a manic episode in 2018 my husband’s brain had changed. New 2021 Psychiatrist (we moved to get better care) they prescribed meds for his persistent tremors, but he still needs to sleep all day. His short-term Memory is shot, he can’t follow Basic instructions, and can’t understand written instructions. Having a conversation is slow, confusing & frustrating for both of us. 
Now retired I our 50s, I care for him 24/7 and am totally exhausted at this point. Drs don’t see the full picture.I think he has early stage dementia. He used to be a scientist working for the US government, now he has to be reminded to shower.
Unfortunately vascular dementia can often follow a stroke.",2022-03-17 14:02:31,,tgg7pf
Dementia,Hospice,"Doctors made the decision to put Mom in hospice care.  I was just finally accepting the fact that she was going to a nursing home and now this.  She's so miserable and has zero quality of life, that I should be relieved she will soon be able to rest, but I'm not.  I'm just feeling sad and guilty.","Please don’t feel guilty. Dementia sucks and it’s 100% impossible to do all things “perfect.” Perfect is an illusion in normal healthy lives, so even the illusion crumbles when dementia is present. If you can’t shake the guilt, please get counseling. You deserve to be released from the guilt.
My mom was put into hospice 1 week ago today.  It was not even a hard choice as she has stopped eating 2 days prior, slept much more than she was awake and was completely confused when if at all she was awake. My mom left explicit instructions that she did NOT want to live that way.   Now she is asleep all day, medically speaking she is pain free (morphine) and she will pass quietly in her sleep.  My dad is still burdened by her death but he is no longer burdened by her life with this bull$%^& disease and neither is she.  Its the right choice, a humane choice.  I hope you find peace.
My wife is entering the final stages. I hope you don't mind me asking a few questions.

What was your mother's living situation and mobility before the doctors made the hospice decision? Was there a triggering event that preceded their decision? 

As someone who is struggling daily with their emotions, thank you for your post. My life is going to be dramatically different in six months.
If it's any consolation... if her most significant medical condition is dementia, there is not really a downside to electing hospice. It's not like there is chemotherapy for dementia that would be ceased. But her quality of life will become better. She and you will only reap the benefits of having nurse visits, getting a point person who knows your family, a stream of supply deliveries, a 24-hour nurse phone line, stronger meds, bathing 3 times a week, even spiritual counseling, etc. My grandmother was on hospice for less than 2 months and I wish we'd been referred earlier.
Unless your mother has another medical condition which requires treatment to prolong or sustain life, she should get the same kind of care in hospice as she would in a nursing home -- maybe better.   Hospice staff will help her with bathing, dressing, toileting, eating -- all those tasks of daily living that can be so difficult for us family caregivers to get our demented loved ones to accept.

My mother (who didn't have dementia) went into afib and developed kidney failure.  She was intubated for several days but regained consciousness and began breathing on her own.  At first the plan was to get her on dialysis, etc., but she really didn't want it.  After the hospice decision was made, she stopped taking a lot of the meds she had been on for treatment of conditions like Type 2 diabetes and macular degeneration, but continued to take meds that kept her comfortable, like lasix to reduce swelling from edema.  And of course, no dialysis.

I hope your mother gets the care she needs, and that you can spend time with her as her child, rather than as her nurse.
I’m currently in the process of having my mom evaluated for hospice, and it hit me a lot harder than I thought it would, because I’ve been praying for this to be over for months. She is very clearly on the decline at the moment, and is becoming less and less able to do anything for herself. I’ve finally started focusing on memory care placement in the past few months, and now this is such a sudden shift. But if she qualifies and starts hospice, I feel like this will be better than memory care. Otherwise, I feel just the same as you right now. Take care of yourself, too.
You will find the kindest, most unselfish people in hospice care. She is in good hands.",2022-03-17 11:37:24,BlueRFR3100,tgcziu
Dementia,How common is denial about dementia in a dementia patient?,"I’m struggling to provide care for my mother because she is adamantly in denial about having any cognitive decline. Yet she can’t remember how to use the phone, the oven, can’t drive to new places, and her short-term memory is shot. (Just a few examples) She also must use a walker to walk as she’s developed stooped over posture and has a short unsteady gait. I have taken over most of the things she used to do but at the expense of living my own life, yet she insists I don’t need to be doing any of what I’m doing, that I’m “undermining her autonomy” and that she’s “perfectly fine on her own.” I’m just wondering how common this denial behavior is? For context, she has Cluster B personality disorder, and I am the only family involved in her care. Thanks.","Yes, this happens. If they could remember that they had dementia, then they wouldn't have dementia. They would cope - write everything down, etc. etc. 

And it is will make  you question what is real and what is not. 

""I am the only family involved in her care"" - I think you are showing the first signs of burnout. We need to get more people to care for her. You can't do all of this 24/7 or you will not live your life. We either need to get more help from family, or from people that are paid to take care of her or whatever. Introduce these people as ""long lost cousin"" if needed.
You are describing my wife’s behavior. I believe this behavior to be very common. I the number of times I’ve heard “you don’t take care of your children like this, I’m not your child”.
I totally understand. My mother is very similar. She believes she is fine and doesn’t remember the limitations her doctors have set on her. When I remind her, I’m the bad guy. And I’m very tired of taking all the beatings myself. Being the sole caregiver can be so tiresome and overwhelming. You’re definitely not alone at all.
It’s very common. He’s a link from the Alzheimer’s Society about it. [https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-support/help-dementia-care/understanding-denial-lack-of-insight](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-support/help-dementia-care/understanding-denial-lack-of-insight)
I've had many talks with my dad over the past couple years about how concerned I am getting with each new thing he has trouble with. Always the same response: ""Oh, I'm fine."" Always a new deflecting when you point out why they're not fine.

I found out his neurologist diagnosed him with probable Alzheimer's like 10 months before we had to put him in a memory care facility, and he just completely ignored it. And I know he was aware enough then of what the diagnosis was.

He chose to live on his own and decline without help from family, doctors, etc. Once he needed memory care, he was far enough gone he didn't put up a fight.
Anosognosia and I absolutely saw/see this in my Father who suffers from dementia. Absolute denial about what's happening. Even when the Doctor plainly told him the diagnosis, we got out to the car and he told me that the doctor was insane and didn't know what he was talking about. Even as he is hiding things that might reveal his decline to others, he is unable to see the disease for what it is.
It's extremely common. I'm struggling with this right now with my own mother. She can't write her name, can't use the phone, needs help cutting up her food and getting dressed. And yet, if you ask her, she's ""doing fine"" and she can't imagine why everyone insists on ""treating her like a baby"". She's starting to really push back on being helped with daily tasks, and she insists she can do all herself. (She can't.) She freaks out if anyone even whispers the word 'dementia' in her hearing. My dad and I are working so hard to care for her, and she's just resentful of our efforts.

I have no advice, only empathy. It sucks, and it makes you start to doubt your own perception of the situation. Just remember that your perceptions are 100% correct: your mother DOES have dementia. And she WON'T accept or understand that, because that's part of the disease. 

I've heard it said that if the patient was capable of understanding or recognizing their cognitive decline, they wouldn't have been diagnosed with dementia in the first place. Not being able to assess your own abilities is a hallmark of the disease. But it's exhausting for caregivers. I'm sorry.
Very common. It’s a conversation you’ll have many times with them reminding them about their dementia.
It is very common especially in early and mid stage dementia. My Mum and I cared for Dad at home through hospice during his ten year battle. We both led Alzheimer’s Association meetings for caregivers, I still do. 

Mum was diagnosed in 2019, we moved her in with us after selling her home in 2020. A bookkeeper all her life, she had made a mess of her finances and was regularly getting lost in her own neighborhood. She argues with me, her Drs and anyone who says she has a decline. I’m sure it is terrifying because she knows what is coming. 

It’s heartbreaking because she is my best friend and all her anger and rage comes out at me. I try hard not to internalize it, but it’s hard. Also, my husband is awaiting a heart transplant so there’s a lot going on, and unfortunately she can’t help, and any changes in her routine sets her off. There are a lot due to hospitalizations, etc. 

She finally “believed” me after she took the car two years ago to go to a store one mile away and ended up lost six miles away. Luckily the clerk in the store realized something was wrong and called the police. We hadn’t changed her identification yet, and were lucky she remembered the name of our community and one of the cops happened to have lived here. She was able to find out place once they drove her in. 

It’s so, so hard. Highly, highly suggest a support group. They are my sherpas and nobody else understands what we are going through like those who are also in the trenches

Sorry to have rambled on. Wishing you the best.
Very common. Unfortunately, trying to correct them or build their understanding about their difficulties is not going to work. The memory problem means they can't remember the errors they have made, and the organizing and problem solving problems mean they can't figure it out for themselves.  

This often leads to anger, because from their perspective they are normal so the problem must be everyone else.
It's actually one of the symptoms, and the insistence that they are completely fine and don't need help is one of the key differences between normal aging and dementia.

In my grandmother's case, any mention of the words dementia or Alzheimer's freaked her out.  She felt we were gaslighting her as part of a grand conspiracy to lock her away in a nursing home prison. This also came with the Capgras delusion, where she thought her family members were perfect body doubles of her real family, and that we were telling her she had dementia to make her distrust her own memory, which in her viewpoint was fine.

Towards the end, when she asked things like ""why can't I walk?"" she did accept the explanation that she was ill with a brain disease that is killing her brain cells. Dementia and Alzheimers as words still made her upset but the brain disease concept was ok.
This is extremely common even without the Cluster B issue. The part of their brain that can recognize a problem is one of the parts affected quickly. 

It sounds like you're stressed out. Caretaking a parent is already really tough, add in a lifetime of abuse and I bet you're burnt out. If you have the ability to get her into assisted living, even on a Medicaid plan, have no regrets about it.
Do you have financial and or medical power of attorney for your mom? I don’t know about outside of the US, but in the US you will need this to manage her affairs or put her in memory care. My mom also refused to accept her diagnosis , from her family, her neurologist and her primary care doctor. She accused us all of trying to kill her or lock her away. My dad died unexpectedly last year leaving me and my brother with the responsibility of taking care of Mom. Fortunately we found a durable power of attorney for her listing my brother as her agent and it was signed years before she was diagnosed. You cannot get a POA for someone who is already incapacitated mentally. You would have to get guardianship to make all necessary decisions for her. I know all of this can greatly complicate the issues you’re dealing with. But please know people on this sub are here for you. And please take care of yourself, first and foremost. I am currently in my home town specifically to start cleaning out my parents’ home. I am staying at a nice hotel with a jacuzzi tub so that I have a peaceful retreat at the end of each day after the emotional storm of working at the house and visiting my mom in memory care. Blessings to you.
It's pretty common.  Most people don't like to admit the minor changes that happen as we get older.  I probably needed glasses a couple year prior to actually getting them.  Imagine how hard it is to admit that you are losing your identity.
Denial is much more commonly experienced by family members, specifically well spouses.  People with Dementia are generally not in denial, they are unaware:  big difference.
My mother is the same way.  She thinks she can still drive and is fine.  She can't: toilet on her own, operate a phone, use a microwave, put on socks, wash herself, walk ndependently, etc.   She can't be left alone, yet thinks she is just fine and thinks she lives alone.  She has had someone with her 24/7 for the last two years.
You may be able to buy yourself some goodwill by hiring an aide but just calling them a housekeeper. Having her go to Adult Day Care, but with the belief that they are a volunteer helping out the people who ""really"" need it (you'll need to get the staff to play along, give her very low-risk tasks etc). ETA: for Doctor's visits, you can also say that it is for regular preventative screenings because she hit a certain age-benchmark, since she doesn't believe she is unwell.
Ah… 

Anosognosia versus denial versus concealing
I found a good adult day care for my husband. He loves it and says all the participants come from professional backgrounds (likely true) and also that none have dementia. They all have dementia!

Do not let your mom see the neurologist alone. They will need your opinion on everything she says. 

In my state, there is also a Mental Health POA which is important. You can still possibly get all of these signed by your mother if she will sign them. No one is likely to contest them. Guardianship is a long road. Durable POA for finances is trickier. I just printed one off initially from LegalZoom effective immediately and took my husband to the bank and had it notarized. 

She should not be driving. Her insurance will not cover any accident she is in. Report her to the DMV if necessary or have her PCP report her and ask for a driving assessment. 

Hugs to you. I agree that you shouldn’t be wasting more years of your life to an abusive woman. I think you could easily justify putting her in a memory care facility. 

I also feel like a slave around the house. My husband is incapable of realizing or appreciating all that I do which is almost everything. He lacks empathy. It’s all about him. This is common in dementia patients. 

Actually you may be able to get her to accept help by saying you need help, even if you make her think you’re totally useless. Start with a “cleaning person” and use that time to get out of the house.

But I’ve dealt with this too and my undiagnosed narc mother had to learn the hard way. So did some of my siblings who were in denial, because their mother couldn’t be anything less than perfect. 

You ARE NOT required to caretake her.  You need a life outside of her. Yes, there’s going to be guilt and probably lots of it, but in the end it will save your sanity.
Great, keep going. Btw if you’d like to connect with other sources of help you might check out clinical studies for dementia. Including my code below https://www.withpower.com/go/tevb/clinical-trials/dementia?referralBonus=hungrycommissioner22
Often... I see a dementia patient as a visiting hospice RN case manager where the family does not want me to use the words Alzheimer's (the patient's specific type of dementia) or the word dementia... and when I first started seeing the patient the patient would scream out, ""I don't have dementia, do I..."" and then start crying... and I said nothing including that I'm from hospice; I just stated I'm a visiting nurse coming to see you vs. your going to the doctor's office.  One day the patient was having an anxiety attack; I called the family to ask for permission to give a medication to help and when the patient heard I used the word ""anxious,"" the patient who was pacing like crazy and being anxious in almost the extreme yelled, ""I'm not anxious!""",2022-03-17 09:42:12,SuchMatter1884,tgaj5f
Dementia,Nameda - suddenly wants to smoke again?,"So, my 80 year old with beginning dementia started taking 20mg of Nameda last month. She stopped smoking last summer (before dementia) but she was only smoking 1/2-1 cigarette a day. 


All of a sudden, today, around 7 pm she’s craving a cigarette. Seriously craving, as in going from room to room trying to find one even though I’ve reminded countless times that she doesn’t have any more. And, she’s started feeling arthritis pain in her knees today for the first time in months and months. Are these “side effects” of taking Nameda? Are, idk, brain paths opening up again or something?",It's likely not related at all.  Namenda Isa very benign medication and has no relation to cravings.,2022-03-16 23:26:41,Potter299,tg0to8
Dementia,Things to do for Grandma who won’t do anything?,"So, my grandmother is 88 years old and has moderate to severe dementia. She has no interest in doing anything - no magazines, no computer games (which she used to love very much), she won’t do puzzles or sort laundry. She is very immobile, and has a multitude of physical problems including two bad knees and she just recovered from Covid-19… She doesn’t do much but talk nonsense all day and gets really, REALLY angry when told what to do. She basically needs assistance 24/7 and as a 20 year old college student I can’t constantly entertain her. Any ideas for what I could give her to keep busy? Thank you in advance!!","My aunt is the same way. She never had any hobbies and isn’t interested (or capable) of starting them now. What about tv? Does she still enjoy that? Or, does her mind wander too much? Are there any free daycare programs for Alzheimer’s/dementia patients in your area?
Things my mother enjoyed mid to late stage included looking at very old photos of her family, looking at cute baby pictures, listening to music from her childhood/teen years, looking at Christmas tree lights (tree or in a jar), just sitting and holding something soft, looking at flowers and birds outside her window, or watching zinnia tv (online free/paid tv made for dementia patients). She played catch and enjoyed seeing us blow bubbles through stage 6. 

Good luck. I hope something helps.
Youtube has music concerts on it as does a lot of other streaming services.  Dad likes dolly parton and elvis so i put on their concerts.  The concerts dont require as much memory as you only need to enjoy thr moment with them so they work well.

I also decided to start playing video games with my friend over discord while my dad is watching the game.  Steam has remote play or parsec will let you play any local mulyiplayer games together.

friend is nice to my dad and says stuff to him every so often while i play with her,  and the game im playing, it takes 2 is like a movie so not bad for him to watch.

Is he super interested, no.  Does it make me feel way better.  Yes.  I decided if he doesnt have any interests we can at least do things i like.",2022-03-16 23:01:18,mmochiikittenn,tg0d5j
Dementia,I cannot take this anymore.,"If you had read my other posts you will know the following.
1. My dad has vascular dementia
2. My mom is taking a lot of strain and can become quite mean to my dad.
3. I am close to losing my mind as well.
My dad is just going down hill the whole time...no matter what we try to make him feel better NOTHING WORKS..he had chest problems and coughs non stop..he has two kinds of inhalers, cough syrup, chest balm ect...i have tried postural drainage with him and coughing exercises NOTHING WORKS AND HE NEVER FEELS BETTER. He has literally lied and said he feels better but then a hour later says he feels bad again. 
He keeps saying he feels sick he feels dizzy and i do not know what is wrong with him. I do not know how to help him. Sometimes he won't even tell us that he has pain he can straight up burn his fingers badly while lighting a joint and won't flintch NO OUCH NO SWEARING NOTHING. He is smoking himself silly HE SMOKES WEED NONSTOP and then goes into a stress mode if his weed is finished and he can't find any he has even stopped smoking tobacco to smoke more weed. He cannot cough out anything in his chest never coughs out mucus or flem. Says he can't cough..he keeps saying he is blind or he can't see but the doctor says his one is fine and he should have no trouble seeing..his other eye has problems. I now have to help him eat sometimes because he is too weak to lift the bowl but other days he is just fine.I WISH MY DAD WAS NORMAL AGAIN I CANNOT STAND SEEING HIM LIKE THIS I CANNOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE.","Is his doctor aware of his nonstop smoking? Call them tomorrow to discuss the issues.
Have you tried edibles with your dad? Same, if not more of the weed effects, none of the smoke. Even the concentrates would be better than straight plant.
OP tell your doc and see what you can take that would be very mild but relieve your stress.
Hard for dr to make diagnosis when substances are involved. Does your Dad have emphysema or COPD?
My husband has a non stop cough as well.  Went to specialist after specialist.  

Finally discovered he had a hiatal hernia.  Part of his stomach bulges into his diaphragm allowing stomach acid to escape and cause the non stop cough.

He finds that smoking pot makes it worse but oil isn't so bad.

When there are so many health issues sometimes finding the cause of one takes some pressure off emotionally.

Deep breaths.  You've got this.

Edit . . . I'm not a doctor but I know sometimes having an idea of what an issue might be sometimes helps the doctor thinking in the right direction.  Definitely talk to the doctor about the amount he smokes and why.  

Last appointment I typed out everything in advance and it got us focused on what was going on and how everyone was dealing with it.
You can tear muscles in your chest from coughing too much. Could be that, or nothing. My mother says she has all sorts of ailments all the time, and has COPD so she gets rales when she lies down which can be really hard to be around. If he won't quit the weed get him a water bong maybe ? Might make it less irritating, or a grinder for his weed and grind it for him, remove all weed wood before grinding. Smoking weed wood will make a person cough pretty bad.
Sorry to hear about your dad's condition and what you are going through.  All I can do is offer my prayers and hope you find the strength and peace of mind to deal with this.  I was where you were 6 months ago, I felt like my life was destroyed and I was stuck in some nightmare with no escape.  I snapped daily, I hated how he lied, how he would sneak out the house to buy cigarettes,  with his COPD, achalasia, chronic pneumonia and dysphagia, smoking was the last thing he needed.  He would vegetate all day and act like a spoiled brat and demand everything and not lift a finger.  Last year was hell, I spent 8 months in and out of hospitals with him, dealing with near death calls every other month.  In the end I came to the conclusion, my dad left a long time ago, what's in front of me now is a shell of the man.  All I can do is honour him for the short time he's here and help him transition to the next stage.

If I were you, I would lean on family and social programs for medical services that provide in-house care for the elderly.  Some states also have programs, like California has PACE.  Lastly, it's ok to lose it, you're not a bad person, dementia is horrible no one should deal with or is equipped deal with.",2022-03-16 19:52:54,StudentTeacher278,tfwqvx
Dementia,Lack of Sleep,"Hi there, I was wondering how everyone deals with lack of sleep/exhaustion while caregiving?

My grandma is up from midnight until 6AM usually, making a lot of noise “packing” for various trips, or getting stuck. I have to get up and corral her back to bed multiple times a night. 

I am just drained, I feel like I have no energy at all. Any helpful tips are greatly appreciated. I’m the only one taking care of her; the rest of my family has either passed, or they want nothing to do with her, so I’m solo in all this. 

Doc has her on donepezil (sp?) and risperdone. No sleep medication.","I had a horrible time sleeping a while back and no sleeping meds could help me. Finally I tried cbd and boy did that knock me out good. Maybe your grandma could use some so you could get some sleep?

Hugs!!

I am a full time caretaker to my FIL with Lewey Body Dementia and it has been a rollercoaster, to say the least..

My FIL is on risperdone for ‘sleep’ but it’s an antipsychotic that was prescribed to him when he was Sundowning bad… 

He is a severe fall risk because of his initial fall that happened about two years ago and now he is mobile(ish) and stubborn as hell..

He has had home hospice and they recommend benzodiazepines to make him sleep but he falls so easily..  

My husband and I are apprehensive to give him anything mind altering because of his horrible gait, mentality, and our seven year old daughter lives in the house and has already experienced too much for a kid…

I have read that light sleep aids may help but there is always a fall risk—especially with wandering at night..

And be aware of any RX that is in the Opiate classification, you do not want to witness a disimpaction ever… 


I wish you both the best and please DM me if you want to talk… I am in the same story, different chapter.. 

Hugs!! 💕
I second the cbd but if the cbd doesn’t work, speak to the doctor. My aunt is taking a medication for something else that she takes at bedtime. Her doctor switched her to a similar kind of medication but this one causes drowsiness - just enough to put her to sleep.
Donazepil made my husband agitated. He was switched to Seroquel (quetiapine) and 10 mg melatonin. He sleeps like a baby for 12 hours. Before that, I was up multiple times with him. 

What does your grandmother do during the day? My husband recently started at a day center and that helps wear him out. 

As to the answer of how to you deal with lack of sleep, you can’t. No one can function like that long-term.
We got my mom a dementia clock. It helped quite a bit because she could look at it and see that not only was it 2, it was 2 in the morning and my brother who lived with her could point that out to her and she'd go back to bed willingly after going and waking him up to tell him he was lazy for sleeping all day. She wouldn't believe him, but she'd look at the clock and apparently it wouldn't lie to her. Didn't stop her from waking him up but she'd go back to bed easily.
I don't really have any helpful suggestions for you, sorry but just wanted to say I feel your pain, I am going through similar with my 92 year old father, I have never felt exhaustion like it in my life, please take care xx
Seroquel will be your best friend, OP.  Let her doctor know what's going on, and they'll help you. 

Mom's  PCP put her on Seroquel because she was getting up 1-2 times a night a few times a week, and, it also helped with her aggression.",2022-03-16 18:52:36,Commercial-Mud32,tfvhr3
Dementia,Does anyone have experience seeing a loved one develop Lewy Body Dementia?,"I was just re-reading my mom’s recent neuropsych eval, and due to a fixed delusion that my mom has (that she has cancer—she doesn’t and never did) the report indicated that “DLB should be in the differential going forward.” (I didn’t even know what that meant the first time I read it). In recent weeks, my mother’s posture has become very stooped, to the extent that her orthopedist has ordered her to use a walker. (He has run X-rays & ruled out any fractures/orthopedic issues). She walks slowly and is stiff. She avoids all social interaction, is sedentary 24/7 and won’t make eye contact w me unless I specifically ask for it. It feels like she is going downhill very quickly. I’m just looking for insight in case anyone has seen their loved ones through a similar experience.","Yes, my husband has LBD with Parkinsonism. It’s a long unfortunate story. He was a long-time family friend. His family ignored his symptoms. We got married and I got him medical care. 

My husband was left-handed and now his left arm is bent at his side and he has to use his right hand. He walks slowly which is called bradykinesia. He talks more softly. 

Some characteristics include “on days” and “off days”. My husband has only some on hours, not whole days when he appears normal. Some people with LB get hallucinations. My husband does not. 

My husband’s decline has been helped by the Exelon patch. However, there are many medications that can help and the earlier the better. 

Check out r/Parkinsons as LBD and Parkinson’s are caused by the same mechanism.
My grandmother went through LBD.  The earliest signs were hallucinations (she saw people, mostly children, animals and repeatedly fire), followed by extreme paranoia and aggression. She would go for days without opening her eyes unless she needed to complete a task, like eating or dressing herself. She'd simply sit with them closed, but would respond to conversation. She'd have days and days of being hyper-awake in the middle of the night or late in the afternoon, agitated and wanting to leave the house. She went into a nursing facility after basically swatting herself multiple times. Family members and caregivers wouldn't know she had called the police or fire department to report strangers in the house, stealing from her or keeping her in a room, or a fire until they arrived.
My dad started showing symptoms in November of last year. He's now getting physical therapy and speech therapy while experiencing hallucinations. There are a lot of factors that help stop progression, but progression nonetheless occurs at different rates per person.

I would continue to speak with your doctors and make your observations known, they'll be able to help you the most and guide her care.
Oh I am so sorry. Has your Mum been officially diagnosed? WHen I was researching dementia before my mum was diasgnosed I came across this series on youtube:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QYL3PlMyII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QYL3PlMyII)

Joey has a brilliant way of educating people about Lewy Body dementia through telling a video story about his own mum, but it is very, very sad and confronting to watch. I found it to be invaluable because it really helped me communicate with my mum in a way that didn't confuse her or stress her out or make her angry. It's been over a year since I watched it and Mum has been diagnose with Alzheimer's Dementia and is now in assisted living.
Yes my mom was diagnosed recently with LBD. It started when she was unable to paint anymore, which is sad because she's an artist. She has lost her ability to understand electronics to the point where she can barely use her iPhone. She shuffles her feet when she walks and her speech has been affected too. Hugs...it's a terrible disease.
Yeah. It’s going to progress faster than Alzheimer’s. Be careful cause some Alzheimer’s meds don’t work well with LB. My uncle saw bugs a lot and heard children. Also be really careful at feeding. Like don’t leave toothpicks in food and they can grab or drink something you wouldn’t expect of them.",2022-03-16 17:50:54,SuchMatter1884,tfu56i
Dementia,Questions for the doctor,"My dad (92y) has a wellness appointment on Friday and my brother is going to go with him. We’d like to get him assessed for dementia but we feel the doctor was not taking my mother seriously when she asked for testing. There were some cognition tests administered and he apparently did “fine” and “just normal aging”. We don’t believe this and I guess need a referral to someone more expert? My dad is very confused all the time. Constant repetition of questions, comments, and stories. He also can’t safely prepare food and has gotten lost in his own neighborhood a few times (fortunately he is very sedentary and doesn’t really seem to want to go anywhere). His toileting is getting worse (very messy) but he still is handling it ok. Doesn’t want to change his clothes, or bathe, won’t accept help with dressing so has had on different shoes and clothes aren’t fastened properly. Anyway, what questions or requests do we make of his doctor? Thanks in advance for any advice.","All the symptoms you described are classic dementia, NOT normal aging. Especially the hygiene, dressing, and not asking for help. You need a neurologist.
Or a competent general practitioner.
You could go to a neurologist for testing. The GP and even the neurologist gave my mother the screener multiple times. Mild cognitive impairment showed up and then. Worsened rather quickly for a while.
Ask for a referral for neuropsychologist evaluation. Simple tests like the MMSE administered in the USA don’t always catch dementia. They might label it “Mild Cognitive Impairment” but you have to understand that there are only 3 categories, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. That covers such a vast range of behaviors. 

Also, the doctor should ask for your father’s input and then for your brother’s input. My husband has Lewy Body Dementia. He’s attending a day facility. He remarked to me that none of the participants have dementia, they all come from professional careers. He’s so happy about that. Well, they all have dementia. 

What goal are you trying to achieve? Home help? Placement in a facility? Validation that you’re not crazy? You don’t have to answer me. It helps to know in advance what you need and to ask for it.
That seems to be a common problem with getting a dementia diagnosis. The person can operate as ""normal"" for a short time and appear completely fine for something like a doctor's visit or a short visit from a friend. We used to take Mom to do something else, like a quick shopping trip where she had to be alert before her doctor visits. She couldn't maintain the facade for long enough for both and had no judgment of what was important so people in the store got ""normal"" and by the time the doctor's visit came along, she was back in full dementia mode and it was easy to see. It felt kind of like we were betraying her to do this but it was the only way for her doctor to see what she was really like.",2022-03-16 11:39:25,nancylyn,tfkgyk
Dementia,Having to explain that her child died,"Im just really sad and don't really have anyone to talk to right now so I want to share what my family is going through right now.

My aunt passed away this morning.  It's been a slow burn.  She had cancer back in the early 00s, always had her routine appointments since she was cleared but since it had been 15 years with no sign of cancer again, they stop doing those kinds of appointments.  This is my tip for the day: continue making those appointments if this happens to you, or loved ones. Im uncertain if it would have saved her in the end but right now I wish it would have.

Anyways, it did come back. About three years ago. And about a year and a half ago, we were told she only had two weeks left to live by the hospital. Well, they were wrong and Im not sure if it's good or bad that she had more time. She suffered and she didn't want people to see her suffer. The last day I saw her was Saturday and I knew it would be my last time with her. I love her dearly and I hope she feels so much better.

Now, her mother who is my grandmother, has dementia and has been diagnosed for years. We are sure she knew her daughter was sick, especially after her bad spell and the hospital giving us two weeks. My grandmother was traumatized seeing her daughter in a hospital bed in her home and saying how God should take her instead. So we are sure she never forgot that, or her illness. But Saturday, when our family was together at the nursing home my aunt was in, my mom took my grandma back to where she lives and it seemed like she just forgot the whole experience of seeing her daughter. And my aunt looked and was much worse than she was after her bad spell over a year ago. Saturday was four days ago so now we know that she doesn't even know that she went to go see her daughter.


Today around 4:45am, my aunt passed away.  Now I'm not sure how my grandmother is going to handle this. It seems like she's reliving the pain every time she saw her daughter and I dont know how many times we will have to tell her she's gone.

This is the worst thing I can think of telling someone with dementia.","Don't tell her. Make something up, that your aunt is away on a trip or whatever. Your grandma will hurt and then forget and you'll have to keep telling her and each time will bring fresh pain. You will be doing her a huge favor by keeping her blissfully ignorant.
Sorry for your loss. I just tell my Grandma that her mother lives down by her brother now. Even if she thinks she just saw her  she still accepts it.
Her brother's wife told her over the phone one day that her mother was dead, and she didn't stop crying about it for a week. Nothing we said could make her believe otherwise. For your sake and hers I would just lie.

She seems to do okay with her daughter being dead, but she brings it up first. Like when we go through pictures, she'll mention that  that's her daughter and she passed away. I would only ever let them bring up the death of a loved one.
Again, sorry about your Aunt. Her suffering is over.
Dear OP, 
Sending my condolences on losing your aunt, and in such a long drawn out way. May she be at peace now. 
Of course you don’t want your grandmother to suffer or relive pain. When our loved ones have dementia, we oftentimes must learn a new way of communicating with them and navigating these complicated moments. It may go against everything you’ve ever believed, but it’s okay to lie to her about your aunt. It’s the compassionate thing to do. Like the other poster said, you can explain that your aunt has gone on vacation, or been moved to a different facility farther away. If your grandmother asks when she can see her, make assurances about some date in the future. Try to loop the rest of your family in to this line of thinking. It does not serve your grandmother, who cognitively may not be able to retain the fact that your aunt has died, to then re-live the grief each time she has to be reminded of it. I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you as you handle a tough situation.
I stopped telling my father that my mum and my sister had died. It's bad enough living through being told that once, let alone having to tell him again and again when they forgot  - think of the agony it would cause. I just said they were out shopping (or similar) when my Dad asked. I believe this is also the guidance given by one of the dementia charities.
Be aware that she will keep asking where her daughter is. There's no point in telling her the truth, because she can't process it enough to move forward. Tell her a lie that won't cause her trauma
""She's on a business trip."" Or she's off visiting relatives.
I agree with ""tell them once and then lie"". But remember that you're not lying to the person, you're lying to the disease.

My dad- no short term memory to speak of by that point- outlived my mother by nearly a year and a half. He would seem to notice my mother wasn't there when we were in the car and ask. ""Well dad, she was sick and had to go to the hospital"" and we'd leave it at that.
It’s not worth breaking your grandma’s heart by telling her over and over that one of children has died. She won’t retain the info, even though you and your family feel like she should. She will retain the distress she feels, she just won’t know why. The best thing you and your family can do is just be with grandma. Spend some time with her.
Compassionate lies are for the best. My mom used to ask where my dad was and I'd tell her he was where we left him. It satisfied her because she thought that meant at home, she'd completely forgotten he'd been gone for several years by then.
Dont tell her
Condolences on your loss OP. Tight long distance hugs. When that happened to me I just did not tell my grandmother.  She lived for 5 years after but I always gave an excuse for why we can not go visit or why she did not visit. I started saying things that I personally believe, for example:  she is probably now thinking of you too Momsy..Love does not require presence Momsy...let's  eat and rest now so we can be present to go another day.
It calmed her down...I do not know if that was the right thing to do. But it worked and I I thinking of doing it now with my mother.
Dear OP, I'm sorry for your loss.  

I don't know if it's a bad thing to not tell her that she lost her daughter. I think you have to decide for yourself if she can handle/remember it. Having to lose a child is already unimaginably painful, having to lose it every day because you forgot is hell. 

A year ago we stopped telling my grandmother (with dementia) that her husband passed away. When she asks for him he's always ""on a work trip and will stay in a hotel tonight"". But at the time when he passed away, she wasn't this bad and we took her to his funeral. It was only 1.5 years after his death that she forgot about his passing.
Hugs.  This was one of the most horrendous things to watch with my own grandmother, but in our case, she kept waiting for her husband to come home.

What we did for the longest time was break it to her everytime that he had died, only to be met with confusion, disbelief and anger while we felt like we were ripping our own wounds open again.  What we should have done, and learned to do later on was deflect it. Instead of telling her he died, we said - he got delayed and won't be able to come today.  He loves you, and misses you and knows you will be together again soon.  This was met by disappointment, but acceptance, and optimism.
If asked you can say “she is not here right now”. It acknowledges the aunt but doesn’t distress grandma. 

OP it is so hard, hard for dementia patients to understand loss because they forget they lost them. 

Dementia and ALZ causes us so much grief.
 A little fib won't break her heart. She doesn't need any more pain added to what she already saw from the visits, in my opinion..
People with dementia cannot properly grieve. My aunt always asked ""Where's Sam?"" And her kids replied ""He's shopping."" If you tell her, she goes through the INITIAL shock each time. She never gets used to it.
My mother’s brother passed away a few months ago and I have not told her. He was younger and died of dementia related illness. It’s heartbreaking, but I felt there is no need to let my mom know.
Hi everyone.

First, thank you for the kind words, it really means a lot to have support especially from people who are very understanding of the situation. I didn't expect to receive this much guidance, I had planned on making responses individually but most of the statements are the same. 

This one really wasn't my call to make. I live almost two hours away from my grandmother and the closest to her is my mother. I was the one who called and told my mother the news this morning and she felt obligated to go in person to tell her mother. I respected her decision but I really did not want her to be alone, so my cousin drove there as well and they broke the news together. As you can imagine, she wept, said God should have taken her and kids aren't supposed to go before their parents. It's truly a cruel and unfair circumstance. My mom has been with her all day so she hasn't been alone. But like I suspected, mom told me she's reliving it every so often. 

I cant say I disagree with most comments here, my only issue is that we still have a viewing and a funeral to attend to. This isn't something we can get away with right away and the strangeness of my grandma's disease is that from time to time memories will pop up. Now I know in a lot of cases, they can remember things from their childhood but not what happened in the last hour. This is also my grandma but now and again she will remember things that happened recently. So I dont know. This is a very delicate situation, I do not want to break her heart every day of her life moving forward. But how do we respond if we do lie to her and suddenly she remembers for awhile?",2022-03-16 07:01:51,2lil2kate,tff1qn
Dementia,How do you deal when your loved one is sick?,"I'm living with my grandma, who has dementia at about a level 4/5... that is she can still dress herself and bathe herself, wash her own clothes etc. but any complicated task...preparing meals, paying bills, at times even counting... overwhelms and confuses her.  She is often uncertain about the day of the week and repeats herself endlessly within just a few minutes.  Her short-term memory can be very bad, BUT her logic and reasoning skills aren't, she's very aware of what's going on around her, she even still drives because she's always aware of where she is and what the other cars around her are doing, just doesn't always remember where she's going unless you remind her.  She's never had an accident in her life.

I have the feeling from reading this sub that I've moved in a lot earlier in the process than most people do... which is great in some ways as I can try to make her life as good as I can for as long as I can, but on the other hand I can't just do as I know is best for her either, a lot of times too it's easy to forget it's the disease because she's always been kind of contrary and resistant to anything new that she doesn't suggest herself, lol.  

Anyway, she has acid reflux really badly.  This is terrible, but it took me about a week to figure out what was even wrong, because she can be a bit of a hypochondriac... my mom had warned me about it, but it still took me a while to spot the pattern of whenever I went to church, or to spend time with my other grandparents, she would claim her stomach hurt as she either felt embarrassed to not want to attend church, or was jealous of me spending time away from her.  

 So last week when she said her stomach hurt, I didn't take her seriously and she went and checked herself into the emergency room.  She wanted to leave as soon as I got there, but I convinced her to stay until they finished all the tests.  They found nothing after five hours, and we went home. 

 But the next day, she was still saying her stomach hurt and then she said her throat was burning and I guessed it was acid reflux.  But she refuses to take tums or pepto bismal most of the time, she says it makes her sick to even look at.  Same with water.  I've had to hide the instant coffee and soda, and it's torture trying to get her to eat anything plain, all she want to eat is candy.  Which she can go out and buy herself.  She sundowns pretty badly and stays up all night  eating all the stuff you're not supposed to eat for acid reflux then is sick in the morning, both because she wants to lay on the couch and sleep, and because she can't sleep because her stomach hurts her too badly.  She can't understand what's causing the pain and thinks she's sick with an illness that I can catch, so she becomes upset with me being near her, and upset with the food I'm cooking for her because she ""can't eat"" because apparently good food and meds and water make her sick to her stomach to even look at.  

Another thing is she seems to be too hot and then too cold all the time, like every five minutes she's asking me to check the temperature, and then to either cover her up with a blanket or rolling up her sleeves and then her pants legs claiming she's burning up.  I try to keep the temp around 70, but whenever I leave and come back she's got it at 78 or 64.   

I'm kinda at my wits' end here, both my mom and aunt live out of state and are counting on me to take care of her, but she is not allowing herself to be taken care of at all.","My very first thought is you need to take the car keys away, she is not OK to drive.  People with dementia get easily confused and then don't know what to do or how to do it and that could lead to her being hurt or she hurts someone else.  Second thing, you cannot control her behavior.  You can try and find things to substitute , maybe nuts or fruit or just not have candy in the household.  Third thing, she may be getting to a point where you might want to consider an assisted living facility where they would have activities for her to do during the day.  If that is not an option find a senior center, many have adult day care options, which would get her out of the house and give her daily activities and socialization.  My husband is also either hot or cold, he doesn't adjust the heat just the amount of clothing he wears. Not much you can do about that.  He also has bad reflux but we haven't come up with how to tackle that problem yet. Good luck.
There are some Tums Smoothies that she may like. I like the assorted fruit flavors, and there is also a berry fusion flavor. I wouldn’t tell her they were tums, but maybe tell her they were after dinner candies or something. They aren’t chalky like traditional tums, so maybe she won’t know to refuse them. If she will take a pill, she can take a Pepcid or something like that daily.
with the food, it is true that people with dementia tend to enjoy candy because sweets are basically the last flavor they can taste strongly and enjoy. I would try to use this to your advantage, look online for foods that are sweet but more healthy. for example its more important for her to get hydration than cutting her sugar so apple juice and orange juice are great. Alternatively you could put honey or maple syrup on everything that’s healthy lol. All this advice is assuming she’s not actually diabetic.

She needs to STOP driving. I know she never had an accident before but you never know when she goes out driving with a UTI (very common with elderly/senior women with dementia, and makes sundowning worse) etc, the first one will be. And she or YOU could be legally liable if she hurt or killed someone and you openly allowed her to drive.",2022-03-16 01:43:45,cavelioness,tfah80
Dementia,Terrified of having both parents be affected by dementia an also being an only child,"All of my (23 F) grandparents on both of my parent's side have had dementia. My father is exhibiting signs of it, my mom will be any day now. I've seen how the people deep in the condition function, I've seen the people taking care of them all function. But both of my parents have had 4+ siblings to help them with it. They all take turns taking care of their parents, they share medical bills, information, care tips. I'm an only child and I know both of my parents and eventually, I will also succumb to the illness. I don't have this network of people who equally care about my parents wellbeing. I'm so scared of losing them slowly and alone. Idk, just venting.","Sorry.. been there. I popped for a 23 and me plus test to see if I was a generic carrier of a variant of the APOE gene, which has been linked to increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease. It was the best $199 I spent to help alleviate stress.
You should talk to your parents.  What are their plans for after retirement?  What are their wishes should they become incapacitated, who is POA etc..  Given the family history they need to have a plan in place.  Their plan cannot be you.  That's not fair.

And you should tell them your plans as well.  Maybe you want to move to Mars or go start a chicken ranch in the distant mountains or just have a life to yourself, whatever it is, it's your choice.  You're entitled to your own life, you didn't bring your parents into this world.  And you're only one person.

Also try not to worry too much.  You're very young still.  There's a whole host of factors that contribute to the development of dementia and you can start avoiding some of them right now.
I'm so sorry, this is hard.  My only advice to you is to get an elder care/estate planning attorney involved now, before the issues arise, to get everything in place.  This way, when the time comes, you only need to make a few phone calls. Do for your future self all that you can do.  

Depending on what state you live in, the attorney will help you arrange trusts to shelter their assets so that the money is there when you need it.  They'll get you a POA, Advance Healthcare Directives, Wills, etc.  They can help with Medicaid planning. These are all things that are time consuming, but worth every cent to have it done properly and will absolutely be a huge help to you later on.
Are you in the US? consider getting your parents to purchase long term care insurance BEFORE A DIAGNOSIS. Also planning their finances to so they qualify for  Medicaid waiver now or at least within a few years
Hey there, I’m kind of in the same boat (but in my 30s). My dad is in the early stages of Alzheimer’s still pretty independent but my mom has to be there to give him all his medications, make sure he doesn’t accidentally OD on OTC meds (happened before because he keeps forgetting he already took a pill or whatever), eats, answer his same questions over and over, drive him, etc. Mom seems fine, but recently am MRI found she has moderate white matter disease and she has an upcoming appointment at the neurologist. 
They both had 3 siblings who were all able to chip in for their parents, take turns as care givers, get hospice, etc when their parents were at end of life. But I don’t have anyone else to help me financially, or help with care giving. Right now my mom is handling it, but I live across the country. 

I recently started Zoom therapy with a therapist who specializes in grief and dementia. I do feel more relieved after the sessions, at least I have someone to talk to who knows what they’re doing. Of course  things are still hard and I worry. Hopefully she will help me learn some skills on how to cope and what to do to  plan for the future. 
Maybe you can find one also? 

It’s not guaranteed that you will develop Alzheimer’s. You could take the 23andMe test if you want, I’m not sure if that would help you feel better though? There’s always the possibility that even if you have the genes, you die of something else before you develop Alzheimer’s. Also my dad is on 2 meds for it, and it’s not a cure but it is supposed to at least help slow it down. You’re so young, perhaps by the time you’re old science will have found a cure. I worry I will get dementia too, and I don’t want to live like that either.

Dementia,I feel like I’m losing my mind. So overwhelmed.,"I’m kind of all over the place with emotions today. The past two years my mom’s health has been declining. She’s having trouble with speech, reasoning, daily tasks, remembering names and where she is. Yesterday she called the police because she was lost in her apartment. She lives in a Senior community, completely independent type of place. She’s 72 and has been there since the pandemic started. So today I visited after getting a call from her neighbor saying she’s having a bad day.

I live about 30 minutes away and work from home with a toddler. I usually have groceries either sent to her apartment or I get them personally on Sunday and spend the rest of the time digging framed pictures, bowls, plates, and other random items out of the drawers. I can spend a good 20 minutes pulling stuff out back to where they belong and the next day they’re all back in drawers. 

While I was there today, I encountered several nosy neighbors who basically said they didn’t think she had any family visit her or care for her. I’m the only family she has and do my best. She doesn’t really keep up with her appearance, brush her hair etc but that’s not really something I can control. I try to brush it for her and put it up if I’m there. I do my best to make sure her clothes are washed, has groceries, put her medicine out for the week and call her daily. Today was especially rough to the point my chest was getting tight and I just wanted to cry all day from the stress. 

I feel like I’m going crazy. Some of these people just have no idea how much I’m trying to keep it together. I know they shouldn’t matter, but it’s like I feel like a failure of a daughter. Right now I’m working with the VA to get her more benefits so we can look into assisted living. She’s a vet (was in the Marines) but these things take time and it’s a slow process. Just wanted to share this with other people who might understand better. Do you have days you just feel like you’re barely staying above water?","Most days I feel like I'm just keeping my head above water. I'm an only child and have received plenty of guilting from others. It's hard not to let it get you down even when you know you're doing everything you can do. My dad lives with me and I swear it's taking years off my life. I just take one day at a time and weed out all the things that aren't important. Consequently a lot falls off my plate but mostly I'm too tired to care. One thing I've learned is if you can focus on any quality moments that you can spend with your mom instead of worrying about the day-to-day organization, cleanliness, etc., Even just a few moments of lucidity, it can really lighten your mood and make it seem worthwhile. Hang in there. You will look back on this time eventually so try to make some happy memories for yourself.
(( virtual hug)) to you both. Our dad died from dementia in June. We were able to take care of him 24/7 for 2 1/2 years, in his home but there were 5 of us. You are both amazing for doing this by yourself. Treasure the “present” moments and remember to be kind to yourself.
You are doing a wonderful job. It's an impossible and heartbreaking role. 

My siblings have done most of the heavy lifting with my Mum as I'm in US and they are in UK but I see their struggle and do my best to help when I can visit. They worked hard to keep her in her house but it became impossible. She's in a home now and at least safe and eating better. 

Be kind to yourself and look for ways to deal with the feelings of stress and overwhelm. Having resources for days like these will help you to get through.
The VFW can help with insight and benefit planning advice... maybe advocacy too? Depending on where she served, see if you can tie more of her conditions to her service. She will get more benefits that way.  I'm sorry. She's so young and you have your hands more than full.  

Be sure to have her tested for a UTI if she's had a sudden decline.  

Have you looked at some of the smaller assisted living places -- the ones run out of regular houses? They usually cost much less and could be something to use while you wait for more VA benefits?
You are a rockstar!  You are doing amazing and no one is allowed to judge you.
ooof I'm so sorry and it sounds like your mom needs more assistance but you're doing your best. Just know that when it does come time for her to move, she might be upset but her safety is more important than any misplaced anger she might have. My advice is to follow up, follow up and follow up! I know these things take time but believe me the squeaky wheel gets the grease and if that means you call every week for them to tell you nothing new, it still sets a precedent that you want answers and you need assistance.
I totally know how you feel about all of this and with the VA too.  After a year I finally get him approved for VA healthcare, and I get a pamphlet about everything they offer, but can't even get him an appointment to see a doctor!  It's like no matter what you do, it's never enough, and people who haven't done it just don't understand.
I’m so sorry. I have no toddler, I’m retired, my husband isn’t nearly so bad and I’m at my wit’s end. I feel for you. 

I agree that she needs to be in a care home. Can you link her dementia to her service? My friend’s husband served in Vietnam and was exposed to Agent Orange. (I might be wrong but his dementia was related to his service). Once those facts were presented, the VA moved a lot faster. Even if she was in an explosion and had a TBI, that may cause them to act.
I could have written this. Please don't feel like a failure. It is such a hard job and you're doing everything you can. Be proud of yourself.

I just got back from being a live-in caregiver to my mom before helping her transition to assisted living. I had some help from her siblings but I worked endlessly to do everything while making sure my mom was ok. And after all was said and done, I had to accept that my ability to do more is hindered by the fact that she will only get worse. I've tried for so long to keep the disease at bay and we're now at a point where it is in lockstep with us, but I'm aware l that all my efforts have managed to delay progression. 

Give yourself some grace. You deserve it.
I work with the elderly with dementia. It is normal to feel overwhelmed, even if you and them do everything right things still seem to go wrong. It is not easy work.
No one person can do it all along with raising a toddler.  I wonder though if you have thought about moving her to residential care while you await the VA decision?  Usually that is provided in regular homes and they have a very limited number people they care for so she would get more personalized care. I would just spend time with her and not worry about putting things back where they belong because you know she will just store them away again! Keep doing what you are doing and know you are doing your very best.  Keep strong.
Im sorry that your feeling so overwhelmed first its not easy seeing your parent just fade away each day, I've been a full time caretaker for my mom she was gone for 30 years living across the country just like that 3 years ago my life changed and I do a lot of crying screaming at the top of my lungs locked in my car in my locked garage. 

For all caretakers we are allowed each and every one of our emotions good bad ugly   even crazy no matter what we are good people who care",2022-03-15 21:34:00,Also_plus,tf61js

Dementia,Scared to visit,"I want to visit with my dad more than I do but I never know what mental state he's in until I get there :( He sometimes is in the throes of a delusion or panic over fear of falling or... and other times he's calm and pretty happy to see me. 

He is currently in a rehab to recover strength after a hospital stay. He's been there long enough for me to try to figure out if there is a pattern or specific cause to the issues. Doesn't seem to be dependent on pain, hunger, tiredness, gas, or the phase of the moon even lol.

I *do* go, of course! It's just very hard trying not to get my hopes up before I see what's up.

It's especially hard when I have to leave right away because he's concerned for my safety because of some imaginary thing that might befall me if I stay. In his mind, he is bravely protecting me so if I don't leave right then, he gets even more upset! 

Anyone else have this sort of thing going on? Any tips??","I have recently been experiencing this my father 63 has Parkinsons and has been experiencing really distressing hallucinations. Since admission to hospital he presentation completely changed  it looks as though he may now have Lewy Body Dementia or Parkinsons Dementia.

I go to see him around 5/6 days a week, as its only 1 visitor per day my sister will go the other day or so.

However I feel sick before every visit, I never know what to expect. There has been no consistency its either extreme agitation, confusion, intense high or he can be pleasant and somewhat lucid. 

I can't not go to see him, but can completely appreciate the apprehension before your visits.

I take a deep breath brace myself and walk through the doors. This is all new to me so I am currently trying to find the positives In any visit. Sometimes that's a hug, a lucid moment, something silly he said ( I am finding it better to change the subject or move it, than argue or correct). Even in the bad visits I try remember he is sometimes not in control of how he is presenting.

My dad can sometimes cut visits short as he's not the most talkative so I've started trying to plan some talking points or distraction topics. 

Is sad when your dad is cutting visit short but you said yourself it comes from him wanting to protect you. 

I hope you find a way to visit that supports you and your dad. It's a tough gig. X1
Yes, went through the exact same experiences with my mom.  Is he not in a care home?  I would say that he sounds in the stage where he needs it.  For himself and for you and your family.  I have done the home care for my mom and it was really horrifying!  

If you are in the US, I have found the Office of the Aging extremely helpful (usually you can find at the health departments).  Hang in there!  You are doing great and do not guilt yourself — it is too stressful.  Forgive and know he wouldn’t want this for you.
I try to stay positive through it when working with people with dementia. Although it's upsetting for him to be paranoid about something happening to you, you can know that he cares and that's why he's worried.
Thank you for your response.

 I am glad you now have a better relationship with your father and understand the reasons for him being distant as a child. Life makes things tough for us at times.

I totally agree with your tip about bringing him food ideas. He loves a little treat so I do bring him some juice and chocolate or biscuits he loves a biscuit and that I'd usually met with a smile. 

Visiting today on lunch so I will see how that goes. The hospital may discharge him soon which makes me worry about the future. I know they can't keep him and I was to support him but not 100% sure what level of care he needs and if it is round the clock assistance or whether he can live independently with support for longer.
He lived alone in IN and we were trying out ""being retired"" in FL under the pretext of visiting my brother (who does not travel). Got here Dec 6, 2021

Dad was coping ok in a memory care facility but got dehydrated, stood up too fast, and fell on Jan 4, 2022.

Nothing observable wrong but they sent him to the hospital as a precaution. There, he contracted Covid!

No bad symptoms but was left to just lie in the bed during the 10-day isolation. Lost a lot of muscle tone, contracted pressure sores (that they tried to lie about 🤬). Released to a TERRIBLE rehab (at least they are the ones that noticed the pressure sores when he got there though). 

He was there 3 days: heavily drugged, little hydration, really no food, etc and almost died. 4th morning they took him to a different hospital where he was in ICU for 2 days then a few weeks in that hospital to stabilize.

Through the miracles of St Anthony, he came back to me and is now in the current rehab (much better) trying to recover. 

His dementia is about the same but it's going to take a long time before he can put weight on his feet because he also had pressure sores ON HIS HEELS!!! They are healing but it's slow. He never needed assistance to walk and now he can't walk at all! 

Anyway, yeah, the facility route IS probably what we will still do but that assumes he gets out of the rehab alive :( This one is pretty good but wound infection is a big worry for me. I'm not sure he could come back from that. 

I think a place is a fine decision, I don't struggle with that. What I do wonder is if I can find proper/enough private care aides to take him home to IN. I don't think he will make it many more years at all but it would be nice to putter around the house with him before then. I'm grateful I'm available to help but I'm definitely not going to be a martyr for the cause. 

Even in his living will, he chose ""if it's not an undue burden on me or my loved ones, I'd rather be at home in my final days"". He knew what he was saying because he watched his own mother die with dementia and I know he wouldn't want anyone resenting caring for him.

Anyway, thanks for ""listening"" :)",2022-03-15 18:46:24,BotherKey6043,tf2l8u

Dementia,How can I help my nan make herself tea?,"The one thing my nan still does is make herself cups of tea throughout the day.

However more recently she's started putting milk and tea bags in the kettle so we've been trying to find alternatives of how we can safely give her hot water without having to worry about filling with water.

Anyone got any suggestions? We're rotating kettles and cleaning them at the moment, tried a hot water dispenser but they seem to have child locks which there's no way she could disarm herself.","What about using something like a Keurig? Even if you don’t put a pod in, it will dispense hot water.
The only way that worked for my grandmother was to get her microwaving water to heat it up, and to provide her with mugs with handles that don’t get super hot. I’ve covered up the other buttons on the microwave so she can just push the start/add 30 seconds button a few times. I hope you can find some way to help her safely carry on this habit :)
What about something like an [airpot](https://www.walmart.com/ip/M-M-Stainless-Steel-2-2-L-Airpot-w-Lever/257634345?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=101115804&&adid=22222222228372867747&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=m&wl3=471949482435&wl4=aud-430887228898:pla-976371665960&wl5=9020213&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=525145763&wl11=online&wl12=257634345&veh=sem&gclid=CjwKCAjw8sCRBhA6EiwA6_IF4ULYW7xRAAsZruu2lbvzzigQemQYJilWFWZppvdMvJ_Nlg2L06EFYBoCHFIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)? I have an old one but it kept coffee hot for over 12 hours. The only thing might be if she doesn't have the strength to push the top down.
My mom loves to make her own latte with Nespresso machine but was getting stuck on the steps. I had her walk me through it how she makes it step-by-step, then typed it all up and laminated it with check boxes next to each step. She can take a dry erase marker and check off each step as she goes. She loves it!
I hope a solution to this issue is found. As a fellow tean enthusiast, I want your Nan to have a cup of tea!

I'm wo derinf if you could pre-make her tea for the day and put it in a thermos to keep it hot?
What sorts of care resources are available to her? Does she live with you or other family? Or have caregivers during the day? Also, how far along is the dementia?

Since this is a process that could be potentially dangerous (water/steam burns can be devastating!) I wonder if it would be possible to create a ""tea station"" for her to ""make her tea"" at, but not have boiling water involved? Not exactly a play kitchen, but similar idea where she has all the ingredients and tools, just not a real electric kettle. And then the caregiver actually makes the real cup of tea and gives that to her. If she makes it out of order or a mess or something, then oh well,  it's more just about doing the activity right? Although this is not something that would be ideal, since it still requires more work for the caregiver, and depends on how far along she is and if she would notice that it's not working. 
It would be great if they made ""safe"" electric kettles that just got warm, but not hot enough to burn!
Have you tried an electric kettle? An added bonus is when it reaches boiling it will shut off and the lid flips open for easy cleaning.
Would a one cup kettle help? Something like this:[Breville Hot Cup](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Breville-HotCup-Water-Dispenser-Litre/dp/B001L5SSGQ/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?keywords=One+Cup&qid=1647378785&sr=8-3)

Appreciate there's still a fill with water aspect but if there's one with a big enough capacity it could be filled and ready for her and just one button to fill a cup.
We used an electric kettle and I posted step by step reminders beside it. It helped for a while.

Dementia,Just thinking about my future.,"I'm 28 years old, so hopefully it would be a long time before I start suffering from Dementia (if ever, hopefully never). Taking care of my 80-year old father with Dementia is an eye opener for me. So this got me thinking.

Is there some kind of a will I can dictate, what I want to happen if ever get dementia? Like, currently I moved back to my home country (Philippines). If start suffering dementia here, I want to be sent back to America, and to be admitted to a home over there? I'm afraid that our laws here isn't strict enough when it becomes to protecting the elderly from caregiver abuse. I'm a citizen of both countries, so a visa isn't gonna be an issue. Also to tell them what food I like or don't like? I don't wanna be fed with something that I don't even like.

I just wanted to be in good hands when I get older. Especially, if I stay single by then.","As soon as we get my mother moved into assisted living I plan to get a personal directive set up for virtually no life saving medical intervention for myself. 

I also will be discussing MAID (medical assistance in dying) to see we’re finally “allowed” to put in a provision along the lines of “I want to be tested for cognitive decline yearly at age ____ and if I’m found to have the start of it, I wish to be assisted to die immediately upon diagnosis”. 

MAID is also supposed to be allowing assistance for mental health issues only as of next March, which is SO comforting for me because most of my medical issues are chronic and not terminal, and I also have mental health issues. This means if I decide I no longer wish to continue to suffer, I can make my own decision. 

My father had dementia in his 70s and my mother is now developed mild cognitive impairment and is progressing towards mild dementia. So nope, I’m out as soon as I’m made aware of it in myself!",2022-03-15 11:30:03,CompUser01,terlvv

Dementia,Anyone ever use a Medicaid planning service?,"So, if I'm being completely honest, we waited too long. The process for applying for Medicaid should have begun a year ago (or more). But, now we really need help and are looking at a Medicaid planner. Basically, you pay $$$ and they do all the paperwork for you and send it to the right place, and get you through the loops. Their mission is to (paraphrasing): Get you and loved one the support you need, while also ensuring you don't break the bank, and also getting through the bureaucracy nightmare and red tape.

So, has anyone found success using one of these planners? More specific details in the comments.","We're working with a law firm specializing in Elder Law, they have paralegals that specialize in the state aid application processes. I'd guess there are ""services"" out there that are scams, my best recommendation would be to do some web sleuthing on ""medicaid planner"" to see what kind of advice there is to weed out the bad players.

Edit: If you're in the U.S., your state should have some kind of Eldercare resources, they may have advice on finding a good planner.
We are thinking of using Eldercare Resource Planning. For California. Cost is $5,600
I'll echo what others have said about an Elder Care Attorney.  If you can afford one, get one! I'm going to use one to file Medi-Cal paperwork for my Mom to ensure it isn't rejected. That would be way too stressful for me to handle. 

Good luck, OP!
I'm working with an Elder Care Law firm in Kansas. The cost is high, but definitely worth it. They've saved me more than I've spent by giving me legal ways to exclude assets from the ""Spend down.""  Saved me almost $25,000.  

Furthermore, the firm I'm working with has nurses on staff that check in on my wife on a periodic basis to evaluate the nursing home for proper care and to make suggestions.  They've also updated my will and power of attorney papers so that if something happens to me, my kids won't have to go through a big mess getting my affairs sorted out.

A good Elder Care law firm is worth their weight in gold.",2022-03-15 05:48:58,crabblue6,telbh5
Dementia,HRT?,Anyone feel like they “beat” hereditary dementia because of taking estrogen?,"Are you 80+ to confidently say that you've made it through a normal lifespan without dementia? Do you have similar aged siblings who didn't transition who suffer from dementia?  


Since women outnumber men 2:1 for dementia diagnosis, I'd be inclined to think that taking estrogen (HRT) will actually make you more likely to end up with dementia.",2022-03-14 21:18:49,No_Detective_2317,ted3ys
Dementia,I’m at a loss as to what art projects/supplies to get my 75 yo relative with dementia,"Hello, All! First time posting here so just want to say I admire and appreciate so many of the stories you all have shared. We are all in this together. 🌈

I have been intermittently helping care for an elderly relative with advancing dementia. She has a live in caregiver however life happens so I help wherever I can. She has been interested more and more in art so we have painted ceramics, paint by numbers, fine line coloring, and similar lower effort art related activities. 

She has awful arthritis so I’m not able to get her into more intensive art such as sculpting. She tends to forget what her original vision was for her pieces so she doesn’t free hand draw and sometimes will be stuck in a cycle of using one color so she doesn’t have to choose. 

Does anyone have suggestions for other art related activities I could introduce to her? I don’t want to rock the boat too much, I just want to make sure she is enjoying herself. I would hate for her to miss out on things that may be more stimulating for her. 

Thanks so much in advance!

TL;DR - Seeking suggestions for art activities that you’ve found useful/fun for someone with advancing dementia.","Talk to her about things she used to do when she was younger. My grandmaw is always talking about crocheting. We haven’t tried this because she probably can’t keep count on her stitches but i am going to let her show me. 

My grandmaw also LOVES cookbooks and cooking magazines btw. Maybe try those? I know that’s not art but….
My mother-in-law absolutely loves the paint with water books. Check them out! Look on Amazon. There are soooo many.  You need only a paintbrush (which vom3s with them) and water.
I love rubber stamps with a few pads of colored ink. You can make cards or just stamp on paper! Easy peasy.
I second the rubber stamp idea. I’d actually go one step further and cut some potatoes into nice geometric shapes and have her make potato prints on a large pad of newsprint paper (inexpensive at any art store). Also: the paint you want to use is just the simple kids tempera paint. Squirt some onto a paper plate and press the shaped potato into it until you get the right amount and it prints nicely. Kids and adults love it.
Adult coloring books have been popular with my mom. Flower designs in particular, she always loved her garden. 

I gave her watercolor paper and paint, and she does enjoy that, but needs a lot of encouragement and/or conversation for inspiration. Still, one of the paintings she did, she wrote ""FOR \[ZORA\]"", and it's one of my most treasured possessions. She kind of remembered who I was, but she really really wanted to make something for me, and that's something I will have on my fridge forever.
An idea I have had is to take something that _I_ would feel like doing and doing it there so my mom could join in or not. 

I don’t know if she would pick it up by herself- maybe watching me would help her remember how and also verify that it is a “worthwhile” activity and not just something that is a craft for old people.
Dollar tree has some great coloring books with varying difficulty and age levels.
before my father died i bought him some very basic bird houses to put together. we made 3.
i’ve been thinking of taking my mom some pretty pieces of wood so we can make a frame for a picture (6x4). basically just a rectangle. she’s not a hammer user like dad so i’m thinking of using glue.
i had bought a lego flower kit but it was way too difficult. i want to do something flower related. 
i bought a knitting kit and hope to learn knitting and crocheting. making shapes to put under a vase like a coaster. 
at xmas i bought some red, silver, gold, colored ornaments and we decorated them with markers and glitter. 
one thing that surprised me was how focused we were sorting coins from a big pile i collected over the years. it’s simple and can be more than denomination sorting. i’ve tried to look for old coins which involves turning all the coins on one side or the other then looking at the date or image. 
i have a magnifier cause i can’t see much better than my mom. also separate the dirty coins. 
i enjoy the focusing and sorting and my mom does too.

Dementia,Should I be concerned?,"Should I be concerned about my mom's memory? For context my mom is 51 and has always had a bad memory I'd know I've got one just about as bad. But idk thinking about dementia has got me concerned for her even though there's been no real family history of it. She does forget words or what she's going to tell me but usually remembers it a sec later and the stress from my dad being out sick for a few months might be also affecting her idk, I just wanted to vent a bit of my worries.","To allay some of your fears… 53F here. Menopause brain is real. Relax. And be kind. Hot flashes also suck.
Stress can cause cognitive problems, and as she quickly remembers it seems most likely this is what it is. I've always had a bad memory and am a family carer. When I'm very stressed I struggle to string a sentence together! 

But because you're worried why not start keeping a record for yourself. Jot down a few notes of the events that concern you. If it should turn out to be dementia these notes will be useful for doctor's appointments down the line.  They will also help you to see if her symptoms are progressing.

Dementia is more than being forgetful. There can be personality changes and odd behaviours too. But if your Mum is stressed she may be more irritable than usual, and possibly depressed. So it can be difficult to know for sure. Again, making notes can help. 

There are other (often reversable) medical problems that can mimic dementia. So if the problems don't resolve a check-up is a good idea...maybe suggest she's ""run down"" than add to her stress by saying you're concerned about dementia!

I'm sorry that you're facing these problems with both parents. Hopefully your Mum is just stressed and everything will improve in time.
It could be anything, really.  Try not to worry.  Things like vitamin deficiencies, hormonal stuff (menopause, thyroid issues, etc), lack of good sleep, and so much more, can cause memory issues or brain fog.  

Her first step would be to go to her doctor for a check up.  They can do bloodwork that can help discover the cause of her memory problems.

Dementia,Angry caregiver,"Maybe this is a vent , maybe it’s an ask to see if I’m alone, maybe it’s a request for tips. My dad is 75 and caring for two years for my mom with Parkinson’s dementia. The entire time of caring for her he’s been nasty. He acts like she did this on purpose. He argues with her about her delusions when I keep telling Him not to. She complains he is mean and she is right. I live in a totally different city and he is utterly defensive and angry if I confront him. He has no compassion. I tell him “pray this doesn’t happen to you”. Finally after my urging he is putting her soon in a state of the art very nice assisted memory care. I’m sad she’s leaving her home but PRAY the structure and therapy will help and social interaction and that hopefully my dad will be nicer calmer with less stress . My brother just called and says he’s gonna confront my dad. I feel like that’s a bad idea . Anyhow - am I alone ? Any tips? Maybe this is a vent . My happy family has been RIPPED apart by this - this dysfunction didn’t exist before Parkinson’s dementia .","75 yr old men do not respond well to confrontation. Better to say, “I know it’s been hard for you. How can I help?”
I wish I had any suggestion other than the obvious ones:  Has he read ""The 36-hour day?""  Perhaps your dad is not inclined to read but the book deals quite comprehensively with the realities of caregiving for someone with dementia.  It may help him lend some perspective to how he is feeling. 

I can tell you from my own experience for the first almost year my mother was living with us I often made the mistake of trying to rationalize and argue with her.  We had plenty of pretty ugly - and of course entirely unnecessary - fights and yelling matches.   My kids never heard me say ""fuck"" more times out loud in a 12-month period than they've ever heard me say in their entire lives when my mom was living with us.

It took me far too long to realize ""it's the disease talking.""  Our logical, reasonable side wants to explain, understand, and rationalize.  With dementia, there is rarely, if ever, such clarity.  10 years ago  sure me and my mom could have discussed things, hammered them out, reached some sort of reasonable agreement or compromise.  The fact is that someone with dementia often lacks the memory and capacity to reach back and realize how repetitive, irrational, and inherently contradictory the things they are saying are.  Often the things being said are silly, absurd, ridiculous, and most of all incredibly frustrating.  We want them to ""understand"" but the reality is they almost never can.  And when we try to get them to understand we just get more angry and frustrated.  

Your father needs to comprehend he is in many respects dealing with someone who is reverting or has reverted to an almost child-like state.  They may have the vocabulary, some of the thoughts, even glimmers of the intelligence they once had when they were fully in control, the memories of the older person they are, but their ability to consistently manage or organize their thoughts, recollections, and discernment is often atrophied beyond recognition.  The later it gets in the evening of course it tends to get worse. 

I drove out to see my mom a couple months ago - she's been living in an ""independent living"" facility for almost 2 years now - and now in the evenings very little of what she says makes sense any more.  She's not so bad early in the day and we can still kind of carry on a conversation.  

It can't be easier either that your dad has to deal with the person she's become contrasted with the person he met, fell in love with and married and spent his life with.  Still, if he has any love and compassion toward his wife he should find it within himself to love her through her decline.  Easier said than done I realize but his anger about what has happened to her serves neither her nor him.
75 is pretty old to be responsible for full time care of another especially if he hasn’t been nurturing. 

You did well OP in encouraging him to place your mom where she can have good care. 

Compassion is the name of the game but it sometimes demands all the self control one has. Just let angry words/thoughts go. Please keep venting lol.
I'm so sorry you're going through this. You are right to place the blame on the disease. I imagine your dad is going through so much heartache right now. Oftentimes, our focus is so much on the loved one who's been diagnosed and we forget the family members taking care of them. Caregivers are at much higher risk of suffering from physical and mental health issues due to the stress of their role.

Try to show some sympathy during this time. Giving him patience will allow him to be a bit more patient with his wife, who is probably becoming a completely different person right before his eyes. Help him as much as possible. Cook, clean, go shopping, pick up meds.

Once mom has settled into memory care, consider helping your dad find some counseling. Caregiver PTSD is very common and can be long lasting. Consider family counseling as well. There may be local support groups that get together and commiserate. It may be nice for him to feel like he's not alone in all this.
Sometimes anger is a stand in for fear. How scary is it to see the love of your life decline? To realize you no longer have the same person with you…just a shell of them in their body? To lose them and have them at the same time. 
Any chance he’s feeling scared and sad and overwhelmed and it’s coming through as snappy and mean? Not that it’s ok to treat someone poorly just because you are scared…but having some understanding of what he might really be feeling might help when approaching him? I’d suggest asking him “ wow I bet it’s really scary and frustrating to see mom changing so much” to open the conversation without putting him in the defensive.
When was the last time your father had a break. When was the last time you or your brother went there and took care of your mother for a week while he went off to get a rest? You want to confront a 75 year old man but have either of you ever stepped up and took responsibility for your mother even once? Do you know what her sleep patterns are? My Mom got on the phone and told my sister she slept all night and it was so restful. The reality, she got up every half hour screaming for me thinking this scenario or that one. She finally went down for 3 hours at 6 am. I got 1 hours sleep. We used to have hospice come in. The last time we saw the doctor that ordered them he yelled at me for not just giving her morphine and putting her in a room till she passed. He said she had no quality of life because she’s losing her memory. She still remembers me, she still remembers I love her. So I’m back to doing it on my own.

How many of those doctors has your father dealt with? Have you or your brother gone to the doctors appointments with them? I get that your focused on your Mom and her issues but have you thought about his struggles? You and your brother have a great deal of compassion for your Mom but none for the man that has stood by her and taken care of her. Did you know that the caregivers have a history of going before or soon after the patient from the stress and not taking care of themselves? 

Once your Mom is placed I hope you and your brother think about showing some care and compassion for your father. As someone that’s a sole caregiver for my Mom I can tell you that the physical and psychological toll is huge. At least my sister sometimes gets on the phone and tells me I’m doing things right. I couldn’t imagine if the family I had left told me how much I was failing and that all they felt for me was anger. I pity you and your brother. Your losing your mother slowly to a disease. I fear you’ll lose your father a lot sooner if you can’t see all that he’s done instead of how you think he failed.
I’m so sorry about your mum and I hope this journey isn’t too hard on any of you.
Have you ever thought about how your dad feels? He is her 24 hour carer. He has to deal with the same thing everyday. Your dad will see a different side to your mum compared to you especially when it’s ‘Sundown. Your dad has not been trained and probably wasn’t mentally and emotionally prepared for this. It is understandable why your dad is acting like this ( I know it’s wrong and heartbreaking). I work in a dementia ward in a care home and after a 12 hour shift I am exhausted. There’s probably a lot of things your dad hasn’t told you, or spoken to you about. Please try and watch a documentary on dementia just so you can see some of the things your dad has been through. (I’m still not excusing him for his behaviour) 
Remember your mum has been with your dad for how many years, he’s probably terrified to be alone, which is why he’s hesitant to putting her in a home. Maybe suggest respite or even going to a day centre for your mum just so he gets used to that transition.
My Dad is in his early 70s and I feel like anger is just the go to emotion from that generation. I got into a car accident (ages ago) and he was furious. But I honestly think it was because he was scared and didn't know how to show it. I would not be surprised if your Dad has trouble showing how upset and scared he is and it is coming out as anger. Anger that he can't fix it and so many other things.
When my husband was first diagnosed I was pissed.  I was angry at everything we were losing and what the future meant for us.  I suspect your Dad has been the sole caregiver of your Mom.  The stress of caring, 24/7, for someone with dementia is huge.  We never have a break, must always be watchful, have to take verbal and sometimes physical abuse, change their loved one like they were a toddler.  It is endless.  Maybe your Dad is someone who just was never able to deal with so much stress.  I would not confront him.  I hope that once Mom has been placed he will be able to regroup and let go of his anger.  It's the best decision for both of them.  Ask your brother to try and have some compassion, even though your Dad hasn't any, because he doesn't really know what your father has been through. So sorry for al of you but your Mom will benefit from the move.  Good luck.
Thank you all. I took a step back
And gave my brother some feedback from this and taking it in myself to have more sympathy for my dad. I really hope my mom going to a memory care home will help give my dad his life back plus the stress of lock down and covid. I suppose it’s a generational issue - to be angry is angry and not covering up other things. Please also note I’m listening to my mom constitEntly complain about him that he’s mean and of course some delusions too like he has a girlfriend in the house. It’s ok hard to balance hearing both of them complain about the other but one of them is sick/disabled . I am going to try to be more empathetic tho to my dad . Thank you all
Not everyone is cut out to be a caregiver for somebody with dementia.

Most of us are unprepared and do the best they can. 

Knowing that you are spending your last good years doing something you are not suited to can be demoralizing and heartbreaking.

Maybe we should all give your dad a break.
I think your brother should not confront your dad.  It will only make things worse in the family.
How does one keep telling oneself ""it's just the disease"" if your loved one has been mean, condescending and critical your whole life?  That's where I am right now.  It's like it's my father's worst traits with NO filter.  This is so hard.  I can imagine it must be so hard for you to watch, @OP. I know it pains my family to see my dad and I argue, but it's like all of my childhood trauma is being shoved down my throat while I'm being expected to cater to my father's every little whim and wait on him like a literal slave.
Your dad sounds very much like my own. There are some other really insightful comments that I won’t echo. I do know that my dad too is the primary caregiver for my mom and he’s pretty exhausted. I help when I can but I also know I could do more. Consider taking some initiative to help with your dad more so he doesn’t feel he has to beg or ask for it. Caregivers are in a hole and the least we can do is help them not go deeper. If my dad gets frustrated with my mom I don’t argue with him even though sometimes it really upsets me. It would only make things worse. I’m really sorry this is happening to you and you’re family. I hope the assisted living will help improve everything.

Edit: words
How do you deal with this situation if your parents live in a different state than you and your siblings? My father hasn’t been formally diagnosed but definitely has cognitive decline. My mom cannot handle it. At all. She is bitter and constantly yells at him (he has physical issues as well and can’t get in & out of a chair very well, has trouble walking etc). Since none of us live there, when mom complains (which is nonstop) we try to make suggestions - start the long term care insurance & have someone help out, move to assisted living, get some emotional help for yourself (psychologist), join a caregiver support group - and everything is no. My sisters and I are at a loss. We are to the point we don’t even want to talk to her on the phone it’s so unpleasant. She’s either complaining about how much she does or is yelling at dad.",2022-03-14 15:58:21,kathc2021,te6a31
Dementia,Question/s about consultant appt for possible dementia diagnosis,"Really sorry about the format and rambling, this post is mostly me just getting all of this out of my head right now. 

For reference, we're in the UK (England),and my husband is 61.


Quick recap of how we got to this point...


Saw the GP at the beginning of the year re concerns about memory/panic attacks/general anxiety. 


GP made a referral to the Memory Clinic for a nurse assessment, which we had about 3 weeks ago. 


As a result of that, the nurse made a referral to a psychiatrist for a further assessment and possible diagnosis. We had that appt today. 


Unfortunately, neither of us (mostly me) feel that he focused enough on the memory and related issues, instead the impression I got was that he (the consultant) thought the memory issues were caused by depression and anxiety, rather than the depression and anxiety being the result of memory issues. Whilst at the appt today, we found that my husband had scored 71 on the Addenbrookes assessment, which I know is..... not good. 


The consultant we saw today is reviewing the information gained from today's appt, and is discussing it with his superior (the psychiatrist who is head of the department), and will call us tomorrow to give us his findings. 


My questions really are about how do I properly and fully convey my concerns about this? I honestly do not feel he really took our concerns as seriously as we do.


My thoughts are that the consultant we saw today thinks the memory issues are caused by the depression and anxiety, rather than the depression and anxiety bring a result of the memory issues. 


I absolutely do truly feel that my husband does have a form of dementia, but I think the consultant is reticent to diagnose that because of my husband's age (he's 61).


Does anybody have any ideas or information as to how we/I can help the consultant to fully understand this?","I wouldn’t get too worried right now. The neuropsychologist is likely more interested in what type of impairment there is, not whether or not the impairment exists. That may seem odd to you now. You are trying to prove the impairment exists, yet they are able to talk to and test your husband in ways that allow them to confirm an impairment exists while also narrowing down what type it is. For instance, someone with Alzheimer’s may answer questions or be able to perform actions/functions in ways that are totally different from someone with Frontotemporal Dementia. Wait to see what the results are and then you can decide if you still need to push for someone to take your concerns about his cognition seriously.
When trying to get my husband diagnosed he was given a 6 hour neuro pysch test.  I was really anticipating a confirmation of the cognitive issues he was having.....NOPE.  We were told he had no cognitive issues.  Fast forward 2 years, a repeat neuro psych test and bingo, dramatic changes in his cognition.  When we spoke to the doc I asked her why he did so well two years ago, she explained high functioning people can initially do quite well on those tests, it's not until they start having significant issues that it will show on the test.  The doc was surprised how much he had changed in two years.  So, keep pushing.  I am on the 4th doctor for my husband, find someone who you feel comfortable with and don't be afraid to keep changing docs until you find one who listens.  Good luck.
You should absolutely be able to give input. At my husband’s doctors appointments, they will ask him and then they will ask me. 

For example, my husband was born in Kentucky but spent 40 years in Virginia, where we met. He now always describes events as happening in Kentucky. I then tell the evaluator that these events happened in Virginia. 

My husband told his son that he listens to audio books. He doesn’t. He says he exercises. Nope. 

My husband goes to an adult day center. He commented to me that none of them have dementia (including himself). He has Lewy Body Dementia and I now have to help him get dressed, shave him, and brush his teeth. 

They aren’t self-aware enough to report their current state. The doctors should listen to your input.
I just wanted to say thankyou to those that have replied.

Mini update: my husband got the call back yesterday, and the junior consultant wasn't sure what was going on, so he's referring for an MRI and neuropsychiatry assessments.",2022-03-14 15:51:28,Wheezy0891,te64em
Dementia,Losing Pills and Need Help,"Hi all,

I've posted before about my grandpa who has vascular dementia, and need some advice again. The way my grandpa takes pills has always caused anxiety for me and my mom as we knew it would cause problems, but my grandpa kept saying that he hadn't lost a pill before so he didn't need to change. However, over the last few weeks we've had quite a few instances of losing pills. Thankfully we've been able to find them and figure out which pill it was so he's never gone without all of his meds. This weekend however two pills were lost/unable to remember if he took them/couldn't be found, so he went without what we assume are two meds. Despite this, my grandpa is still refusing to change how he takes pills, and it's causing lots of fighting. For those curious, one of the pills was found in the tissue box, we have no idea how it got there.

The way he takes his pills is that he dumps them from a small cup onto the table or sometimes from the cup to his hand to the table and separates his 5 pills to take separately (3 small pills, 1 big pill, and 1 big pill). He then THROWS the pills in his mouth, similar to throwing popcorn. His hand and mouth never meet, he has absolutely horrid  hand-eye coordination, and he is usually in a rocking recliner when he does this. Pills have been lost in numerous ways from rolling off the table to being thrown and rolling into his recliner. We've tried to help by having 3 separate cups for how he separates his pills and telling him to just dump the pill from the cup directly into his mouth, but he won't do it. Even with the pills in separate cups he still dumps them on the table before throwing them into his mouth. 

What can we do differently so we don't have to worry about lost pills? Do we give him each pill separately since he's refusing to stop and that way we would at least know which pill he dropped/lost? Do we keep forcing him to do it the way we think it safer?","A few ideas. You could request the doctor write a prescription for the liquid form, so he has to take it with lips to cup. At least for very critical meds, like blood pressure or blood thinners. Let him ""pop"" the multivitamin. If you need to give him pills one at a time, use a spoon and allow him to throw a vitamin to feel like he's doing it his way.
This might be a weird idea but you could have him sit in the shower when he throws the pills in his mouth. Put a towel over the drain and there is a smaller chance of him losing the pill in the confined space.
Perhaps give him his pills one at a time.
You could just crush them (with Dr say so) and stir then into pudding like they do at the memory care places...",2022-03-14 14:23:06,oregonredhead,te43sl
Dementia,Knickers,"We live with my 93 MIL who was diagnosed with dementia last year.  A while ago , she was convinced we were out of bread rolls, now she’s convinced she has no clean knickers.  She has about 30 pairs of the things!  I put them in the top drawer, she kept looking in the second drawer, so I put them in the second drawer.  Now she doesn’t look there and is convinced she has no clean pairs.

As frustrating as it is, it’s always lovely hearing her little gasp of surprise when she’s shown the myriad of knickers in her drawers!

Funny thing is, she could always find her hankies that are kept next to the knickers, but can’t find her knickers!

Edited to give a little background.","My mom's lost a lot of object permanence, so if something's not in her immediate field of view, it's not there.  So she has no soap, though there is plenty in the bathroom.  She has no long underwear (which she wears all seasons), though there are at least three pair in the drawer.

She sometimes puts things that she needs to find easily out on her dresser. Important stuff like nail clippers.  But if she decides that lip balm is more important, she puts the clippers away and displays the lip balm.  Then reports that the nail clippers have been stolen.   She has about six of everything. so an easy solution would be to put one of each out so she can easily find it, but no, it's six lip balms, six nail clippers, etc. and everything else has been stolen.
I have a similar issue with my husband and groceries. He’s constantly insisting we are out of things when we aren’t. I’ve found there is no sense in trying to argue about it or even show him the pantry with tons of whatever it is he thinks we need more if. One thing I’ve learned the hard way is that logic has no place here. More than once I’ve had to buy multiples because we were at the grocery store with him absolutely insisting we are out of something while I know we are not. Easier to buy a couple extra cans than have him melt down in public. 

When we are at home I just say ok thanks for letting me know and I’ll get some tomorrow. This usually satisfies him and then later that same day I’ll offer him whatever we were “out of” and he doesn’t think twice about it. 

I’d suggest keeping a few clean pairs in your laundry room and just say “ I’ve got some right here ready to go” and hand them over. If she’s super worked up I’d say “I’ve ordered some and they will be arriving tomorrow” 
There’s  so much with this disease that tends to fall into the “kind lie” area. Simply because there is no point in trying to travel the logic route.
Good point and I need to take that into consideration. As they say you have to take the good with the bad. You don't know what you have until it's gone. My Mom would tell me she needs more toilet paper and there was 20 rolls on the floor of her closet. She doubles up on anything. She drinks a Vodka Martini stirred but not shaken. I'd rather drink a rum and coke with a slice of lime. Shot of a tequila with some lime and salt or a Margarita. I guess drink and be merry. Cheers and Moms are best.
Be thankful, my Mom, 92 with dementia, kept having hers disappear. I looked everywhere so bought more. I think I was on the third package when I finally found out what was going on. At night she would take them off to put on pjs but instead of putting them in the laundry she put them in the garbage. 🤷‍♀️",2022-03-14 09:14:49,Brown_Net,tdx94a

Dementia,A Question from a Lewy Body patient (61 yrs old)," 

There is an excellent new series on TV called Ptolemy Grey, a story of an old man with advanced dementia who is offered a new breakthrough drug that will restore your memory and body to Pre-Dementia condition BUT it doesn't last forever and cannot be done twice.

Question: If you had advanced dementia would you

Like to see how the rest of your life plays out but CAN NOT change it in any way?

OR

Just let it play out as it normally would?","Good question. I think I would want to let life play out on its own. Reason is that TV shows have lovely magic wands. Writers and creative arists shape the circumstances and character responses to arrive at a message, a theme, a reason for offering this one unrealistic element functioning the way it does. 

But in real life, we cannot control the impact of that intervening, unrealistic element. In my experience, it seems like there is always a price to pay. Something unforeseen goes wrong, has unintended consequences, and the result is we're worse off than if we hadn't tried to change anything. 

But that's just me.",2022-03-14 08:07:12,Thestockbroker22,tdvzj7
Dementia,Needing some advice,"Hi everyone. I want to start off by saying that I am a teenager, and I live with my 68 year old grandmother who was diagnosed with dementia sort of recently. She moved in with us a few months ago from another country. I don't live with her full time, I live with my mom also and my grandma lives with us for one week and with my aunt the next week, they each have her on alternating weeks. The thing is, my mom and aunt are unfit to care for her. They try their best and I know that they do, but they get easily frustrated, angry, tired and are burnt out at this point. My mom and aunt argue with each other all the time about her and they both argue with my grandma as well. They both work full time and have kids so it hasn't been easy on either of them and they are both just upset all the time, always angry with everyone because they're angry at the situation they're in. It's been hard for me because I'm currently in school and I often have to miss out on lectures or come home straight after class rather than do homework at the library or something because my mom needs me to watch my grandma, and I always do it, but this along with all the fighting and negativity surrounding this whole situation has become unbearable for me, for my mom, for my aunt, for everyone. I think for everyone's sake, finding some kind of facility that will care for her would be the absolute best thing to do.

The problem is, every facility or nursing home my mom has looked into is really expensive. Even with my aunt's help (who is already struggling financially), there just wouldn't be enough to cover these costs. What also adds to the problem is the fact that my grandma is not a US citizen (we live in the US). She has a visa which allows her to be in the US for 6 months at a time. That is how my grandma is here now. During this time, my mom is trying to get her citizenship worked out but I honestly don't know where she is in this process. I don't know how any of this works, so I'm not sure if she can get health insurance and if that can help cover the costs of a nursing home. I've tried researching what we can do, but nothing has really been clear to me because I really don't understand a lot of what I'm reading. Our state is North Carolina. I'm wanting to know if there's anything we can do to get my grandma full time care that won't cost an arm and a leg with her citizenship status. My grandma is really sick. Aside from dementia, she can't walk, bathe herself, feed herself, she wears diapers and my mom and aunt change her, she is completely dependent on someone else. She couldn't live on her own and her dementia is worsening rapidly. I'm really hopeful that there is something that can help us, this whole situation has been so miserable for everyone, I just want to come up with some kind of solution.

So, I guess my question is if someone knows anything regarding what we can do for her care under these circumstances, or if anyone can point me in any direction with knowledge about this kind of thing from our state, just any advice really. I think she is going to pass soon. I'm not really sure what my mom and aunt have arranged, but these nurses come to each my moms and aunts house when my grandma is there several days a week to bathe my grandma and give her medicine. It lasts for an hour each time they come over. Like I said, I'm not really sure what it is exactly, but I know my mom has these nurses in her phone as ""hospice"". I believe this is some kind of program that provides this for us, and they also allow us to put my grandma in a facility for only a week once a month, but we've only done that one time. I wish I had more knowledge on this program and what it is exactly, but my aunt took care of it for the most part. I know that we had to apply for it and my grandma was approved because of how sick she is. I know that its free. They've provided us a bed for my grandma and they gave my aunt one too, and a recliner chair and wheelchairs, all for free. Since this was possible to do for my grandma, I'm really hopeful that there's something else out there available to her that will ease this situation for all of us. It is something that helps out a lot but since the nurses only come for an hour 3 days a week, it's not exactly enough, I want to find something for her full time. I know that probably won't be free, I'm just wondering if there's something out there that's affordable. I apologize for my very limited understanding of how things work, I am still young and my mom doesn't talk to me much about these kinds of things, I help out with my grandma when it comes to cooking her something or shifting her position in bed when she's uncomfortable but that's really all my mom wants to involve me in. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear back from someone soon","heyy i have no adivce for the resources part but as a fellow teenager with a dementiatic grandma as well I want to advise you Dont try to find a solution cause the reality of this disease is very bad. I know this advice sounds bad but let me explain. My situation was the same as yours except i live in a different country. My grandma got diagnosed when she was around 78-79ish. I was also like you researching trying to find a solution but as the days went by i realized that it would only get worse. i pulled too much on my plate more than i could handle tbh. My parents then just started taking me for granted and started leaving all of my grandma's work on me. Dementia as a disease itself is very tiring for the patient as well as the people taking care of the patient and it really is something that no teenager should have to take care of or worry about. So from a person who's currently stuck taking care of a dementiatic grandma i suggest dont try to intervene. let your mom and aunt find a solution. By no means am i saying that your mom might act like my parents but im just warning you that it isn't the road u wanna go down trust me. And also a second advice don't rush home dont skip classes. I did all of that and now that im done with high school i regret it. Go have fun, study in the library, hang out with ur friends because u might regret it later. As far as possible try to help but keep it minimal.  Dont be afraid to say no to ur mom if she's putting u too much.....and if u ever need someone to speak to my DMs are open and ill be glad to help... All the best. Keep fighting....
Start with the hospice number, call it and ask for advice as the situation is untenable. Just the transferring between two houses is going to make everything so much worse, and your relatives are definitely not mentally or emotionally equipped to look after your grandmother. 

Sometimes if the patient is transferred directly from hospital to a facility it becomes free, but the agency that supplies the nurses will be able to direct you to the right organisations to ask. 

Do you know why your relatives are not using the week a month of respite care available?
First of all, it’s great that you’ve asked for advice here as a teenager. Having your mother and aunt fighting all the time and arguing with your grandmother must be very stressful. I would try to talk to your mother about that. Also talk to her about how this is affecting your schoolwork. 

You might try calling NC’s council on aging. Here is some information:

https://www.ncdhhs.gov/assistance/adult-services/adult-placement-services

I think that your grandmother is eligible for Medicare or most likely, Medicaid. These would pay for a long term care facility such as a nursing home. 

In my state of Arizona, Hospice programs get money one way and they aren’t likely to recommend a nursing home because they stop getting money. However, many Long Term Care facilities have limited beds for Medicare or Medicaid patients. 

All of this should be available to your grandmother as long as her visa is valid. That is, she has not stayed longer than her 6 month visa. It’s a bit tricky with the permanent resident application bc the US will ask if your mother or your aunt can support your grandmother, bc they don’t want someone to come to the country and use so-called Welfare programs such as Medicaid. 

Your mother and aunt should be investigating these options. However you can call the Council on Aging and explain the situation. If your mom and your aunt are constantly arguing with your grandmother, it’s possible to report it as elder abuse. However this should be your “desperation” plan. 

Also, I agree with the other poster. Your grandmother should be in respite care once a month. Caregiving, especially in your grandmother’s position, is extremely difficult.
I'm a home care attendant for a woman with dementia. I get 25$ an hour I come in from noon to 7 3 days a week. I help her bathe, I make sure she eats, we do activities, we watch shows together and I try to get her to go outside. I also cook and clean. Whatever the family needs me to do really. I believe I am paid from her pension/social security but I don't ask questions about that as it's rude. But maybe you could find someone else to come in once or twice a week. It takes a lot of pressure off the family. It's my job so I'm extremely patient I will answer her questions as many times as she asks and I never get frustrated. I notice it helps keep her calmer and the family has relief.

 I understand if money is an issue you could look into some home care programs. I used to work for a company that the family qualified for free home care I clocked in with a phone call from the home.
Aw sweetie, I am so sorry that you're in this position having to listen to the grown-ups arguing over the care of your grandmother. It's very good of you to want to help but it's putting too much pressure on you I can tell. One of the ways that we try to fix our sad and worried feelings is to try to find solutions but this is supposed to be something adults handle, not the children. I know you're very responsible and I know you're not a child but this is too much on you to try to fix this. These adults in your life are acting like children! You can reach out to your school counselor if you trust them, you can call your area Council on Aging and ask for assistance, you could also try calling the crisis line where you live, and you could also do what you're doing which is ask anyone you can think of for help.

To address your other concern, hospice is for people that are not expected to recover. It is a service to help the person stay comfortable and calm and in a good environment in the time they have before they pass. Your grandma sounds like she is very ill you're right. Hospice workers can come a lot more often than what it sounds like they are doing for you currently. You could probably call them yourself directly and tell them how bad it is and they might step up to offer better more effective help. It could be that your mother and your aunt don't want strangers helping them because of some sense of duty. Medicaid is a medical service 4 people without much money. I'm sure someone can help you find a facility that can help your grandmother. There's nothing wrong with you contacting those facilities yourself either. If you have to go behind your mother or your aunt's back oh, I think that's okay because this is a desperate situation with the welfare of your grandma at stake.

I wish I could hug you and I wish I could help you. Find people that can help you support yourself. If you attend church maybe ask your church members for some support, I don't know. You took a big step by making your post here... hopefully other people can give you better advice than me I just really want you to know I'm praying for you.
I am no lawyer, but I highly doubt your grandmother will be eligible for any kind of government supported long-term care in the US.  

Regardless, this is your mother's and aunt's problem, not yours.  Obviously, you love your grandmother but there is substantially nothing you can do. Study well. That's your job right now.",2022-03-14 00:38:39,bluezel,tdp96g
Dementia,First time poster wanting advice,"Brief Background: I love my mother and want to take care of her. She is in her 70s, I am in my 30s. Most women in our family end up with some form of dementia. She has been forgetting things every now and then but she's aware of it. 

Why I'm posting is this: I once read that making a playlist of music that the person with dementia loves helps them in some way. 

What other little things like that help? We have family photos. She LOVES Words with Friends and that probably stimulates the mind. I'm just curious if anyone has had personal experience with something that helps their parent or patient. 

Also, what are some phrases I should say or avoid as this advances? 
I ask because of an incident that will always stay with me. When Aunt P had advanced dementia, we were told to avoid bringing up her deceased daughters (drunk driving accident) and to not ask if she remembers certain things. And Aunt M ignored this and asked Aunt P if she remembered my cousins doing something and then my Aunt P was confused and started asking where her daughters were despite them being deceased since the 1980s and started crying that they weren't there. 

I just want to be somewhat prepared so I'm not going into this blindly and I've seen people on Reddit help folks out so I thought I'd ask. My apologies if I didn't format this right or if this is in the wrong place. 

Thank you!

EDIT: While I appreciate the power of attorney suggestions and all the super serious responses of what to do when her dementia advances, I must clarify that is not what I asked. I asked for the personal little things that could help based on everyone's personal experiences. So I apologize if my post didn't express that clearly. So I mean stuff like the playlist of their favorite songs. My mother plays words with friends so maybe games that can help stimulate the mind. My Aunt P LOVED gardening and would always be happiest when we wheeled her outside to the flower garden. I'm just curious about the little moments you folks have had that made you smile for a bit. 

I am not looking for advice medically and what to do eventually medically and legally. We already know what to do. We have that taken care of. 

Someone responded with how the things I mentioned may not work. Again, I should clarify I was not asking if something would work or not. I am aware that some suggestions will not work. But it doesn't hurt to try! 

I feel like some are taking this post as I'm coming into my mom's dementia with a blind eye and don't know what to do with her while being grossly unprepared. And I can assure you that our family is prepared. =) 

So thank you for the replies, but I hope the edit clears up what I actually am asking for.","All the ideas about music, photos, lists etc. are fine, but don't be surprised if they don't work.  Now, I'm not saying they won't work. They might.  But there haven't been any medical studies that indicate these things work on a consistent basis with even a small amount of patients.  It's all anecdotal.   Just try different things and see what happens.  

And the same thing for avoiding topics.  You can try, but many people will bring them up on their own anyway.  

But one thing I will say to avoid at all costs is arguing.  For example, my little brother kept trying to correct her when she was talking about a family vacation that she insisted we took and he kept saying that we never did.  But, he was actually wrong.  He's the youngest and Mom was talking about a vacation that happened before he was born.  So, he inadvertently upset her when she was actually right.  If he had just agreed with her, she would not have gotten upset.  

In his defense, this wasn't too long after she had been diagnosed and none of the family realized what we were dealing with.
I have found that as my mother progressed, she forgot who was alive and who was dead.   At this point, if she asks about someone, I say they are alive and doing fine and then change the subject.

What works in one month or year with dementia may not work in the next.   Apathy and lack of interest in once loved hobbies happens.   

Most people do their best to care for their loved ones at home but don't blame yourself if there comes a time when you can't.  The biggest reasons people place their loved ones in memory care is for safety and/or incontinence.   It can become a full time, round the clock job.  

Take advantage of anything for dementia patients in your community.  If there is adult daycare, look into that.

I had 4 really good years with my mom when I brought her out to live near me, when we knew she was in the early stages of dementia.  She lived in a non-profit senior living community that had some light supports in place- 14 meals a month, activities, light housekeeping.   But there came a point when I was over there every day- she forgot how to turn on the TV, or use the washing machines in the laundry room, or turn on her heat.   She picked at a biopsy site on her arm, screaming at me that she needed to be seen by a doctor immediately for what she, a retired nurse, was positive was a dangerous infection.    It wasn't. She just couldn't remember she'd had a skin biopsy the week before and kept picking at it.

Music is good.  And pictures are, too!  Would your mother like to work on making scrapbooks with photos?  My mom did, in the early stages and then I would write down her memories beside the photos.     My mom also loved painting wooden bird houses- she did dozens and dozens- there really was no right or wrong with painting them. 

Enjoy these good years now.  I loved having my mom as my shopping buddy.  She loved getting out.   Things got worse, sadly, and outings became scary and confusing.   But make the most of right now, is my best advice.   And if something comes up, your questions are always welcome here!
First things first-You’re doing great. Just by asking what else can you do. 

You will find things that work just for her. And you’ll see that sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t. But that’s okay. Keep going. Try something else. And if she’s not into it, also ok. I do my best to roll with it. I’ve become VERRRRRY flexible. If there’s a no, sometimes I ask again, up to 4-5x at different points until they’re agreeable. If not, then I stop before agitation. Follow her lead. Read her moods. Even if they change minute to minute. Moment to moment. Agree. Agree. Agree. “Creating moments of joy.” I love this book. Has helped me tremendously. When I find a moment of joy or good interaction, I try to stay in it as long as I can. Interaction with animals? does she have a pet? Pet therapy is huge for some. How bout trivia from the past? Using Google to ask questions about her time growing up or her childhood. And regardless of the details, right or wrong, let her tell you about her past however she can remember it. Once you start to know her stories she likes to retell, ask her about those times. I avoid all phrases that imply, “remember, didn’t you say this, do you recall, asking why questions” and limiting options to 1-2 things. Less open ended questions. So rather than what do you want for dinner? I say- “chicken or fish?” 

Wishing you all the best. Being a caregiver to our parents with dementia is the hardest. Thank you for all you’re doing.

Exercise is good for them. Walk several times a week.
Get power of attorney done as soon as you can while your mother can still consent to it, it is very hard to do once the dementia has progressed. 

You will need to look after her financial wellbeing as that becomes open to abuse from unscrupulous tradespeople and even family members. 

Keep her environment as familiar as possible, and the music is very helpful. Start reading as much as you can about the disease so you are prepared for the stages. ‘Kind lying’ is very important, if she forgets that people have died do not remind her as the mind cannot retain the information and it just causes grief over and over. 

Every country has an official website with dementia resources, and if you can afford it or have aged care funding/health insurance introduce a professional care giver as soon as you can as you will need a break and a familiar person will be better accepted by your mother.
Does anyone think obtaining guardianship is necessary over a POA?
My dad still has a sense of humor sometimes and it also seems he enjoys having people around him talking and interacting just not asking him a bunch of pointed questions Etc. I think it makes him feel sort of like there's a party going on around him and that it keeps him company. 

Sometimes we leave the radio on for him so they're just kind of low background noise. He likes NPR so it's mostly news LOL. I don't think he actually listens to it, thank God!

My dad definitely likes to be outside and he likes to plan nonsensical things, course it makes sense to him LOL. He was an economics teacher so he likes to write things in a notebook when his hands aren't too shaky and I'm thinking he might enjoy messing with a calculator LOL we'll see! 

The hard part for me is try not to insult his intelligence by giving him baby toys. Having dementia is not the same thing as being stupid :-) 

Early on he was concerned about having money in his pocket so we bought some play money off the internet. It is much more realistic than Monopoly money lol. Because he spent so much time in his life with money, he could tell the difference by feeling the paper! He called me (when he could still work the phone) and said that he thought I had been given circus money when I went to the bank! LOL LOL! I was so busted :-) I didn't argue with him I just said ""oh my goodness I'm sorry I grabbed the wrong thing when I left the house today. I must have grabbed the kid's play money""! He was mostly just concerned that I had been ripped off!

Sometimes he will tell me something that he believes and instead of arguing with him I ask him if he wants to know what I think is going on. If he says no I don't press it and I just try to live in whatever reality he's in at the moment.

Here's an example... he is currently suffering from some bed sores on his fanny that he got from being in the hospital. He is currently at a rehab facility and I was visiting. At one point he said ""do you want to know what's really embarrassing""? This was a new thing for him and so I said ""well yeah of course""! He doesn't usually talk about his feelings. He said, ""I've been sitting in this same underwear all day long and when somebody comes to help me change, the underwear is completely stuck to me and they have to peel it off""! He did say it with a different type of sentence structure LOL but I understood what he was telling me.

Well, what's really happening is they do have to take off the adult diaper ""underwear"" which is kind of peeling it down I get that, however... he was misinterpreting what was happening. When they change his ""underwear"", they often need to change the bandages on each buttock to make sure the bed sores don't get an infection. So yes, the nurse is peeling something off of his behind but it's not actually his underwear that has gotten crusty from sitting at all day LOL. When he told me that I said ""oh that would be embarrassing""! Then I said ""I think I know what's going on and I can tell you something about that if you want me to"". He said he wanted me to and so I explained about the bandages. He said ""oh that makes sense"" and then he felt better. It only lasted about three seconds before he started being upset because he has bed sores! I did not call them that, I called them pressure spots but I know he understood what I meant. He was only unhappy about that for a few minutes because I then said ""they are getting better every week and I'm glad they're taking good care of you"". 

Someone told me one time that the dementia patient often only hears the last few words you say in a sentence so hopefully the only thing he focused on was the phrase ""taking good care of you"".

Sorry for such a long response! My dad was very analytical and very smart person so his personality responds well to a kind of calm analytical sort of reasoning method. Even about the ridiculous things that he wants to talk about... such as how 2 start a 50 barrel a day production run of beer LOL! This man has a plan all worked out let me tell you LOL. 

Anyway from my point of view the best thing you can do is keep a really good sense of humor, try to treat your loved one as if they are not fragile and breakable but still capable and strong, and that you are not sad but cheerful and happy to see them. Of course this might mean then you have to go out to your parked car like I do and scream and cry for 20 minutes before you get home.

If he wants to talk to me about something serious or about something he's worried about, I try to be very straightforward but also very upbeat. At one point he remembered that his brother had passed and he said that to me. I said ""yes he did I'm sure you must miss him"". He said ""yeah he was pretty great"" and then he moved on with his day. I think if I had pressed him to have a feeling about it, it might have upset him but he was able to put it behind him thankfully due to dementia! Not many chances to be grateful for the problems of forgetting but sometimes it comes in handy.

Mostly they just want to know they're safe and that you love them and if you can ever make them laugh that's wonderful. Good nutrition is also great but you know some junk food if they can eat it is a wonderful thing. Milkshakes, chocolate candies, pretzels, marshmallow peeps at Easter, stuff like that. He talked once about a really spicy chili like his dad used to make so I made a big pot of chili and took him some and he really loved it!

You'll do great! mostly only because you care not because of the actual things you do. There will be lots of mistakes but hopefully lots of love. At one point Dad had trouble feeding himself because he was weak. I was not especially great at feeding him! He likes to be tidy so I was especially distraught with myself when I would accidentally spell his drink when trying to put it to his mouth or accidentally get food on his mustache Etc. I would laughingly apologize and tell him ""I can't believe I'm not very good at this and I'm really sorry"" as I cleaned him up. He would always say ""oh that's okay"". 

So, mistakes will be made, tears will be shed, but keep in mind the biggest thing is the love you share. They pick up on feelings much easier than they did before dementia I found. If you come in tense and upset over how hard your day was oh, they will feel it! Much better to wait until you yourself feel kind and giving and loving. 

Also another tip! There's absolutely nothing that has to happen immediately or perfectly unless it's life threatening in the moment. They want to wear an ugly sweater, who cares? They only want to have a piece of cake for breakfast, okay! Want to knock down the Jenga stack over and over and over and over and over? Okay just don't get hurt:-)

Much prayers and love sent in your direction! You're going to be fine! Your loved one is extremely lucky to have you so make sure you take care of yourself even if it's really really hard. I struggle to even wash my hair on a regular basis LOL but the upside is I am losing weight yay!",2022-03-13 19:12:33,qui_gon_gin_n_tonic,tdj7mw
Dementia,"Tips for making the move from home to care facility, involving cross country move","TLDR - when moving cross country from their normal home to a care facility, how have people handled explaining the move, and any interim steps before getting to the care facility?

We’re moving my mom to a care facility, near our house which is across the country where she lives. It’s the right thing since she doesn’t really have a support structure where she lives and I’ve been having to fly back and fourth a lot to extinguish fires.

We’re brainstorming the best way to handle the move. She’s mid stage dementia so her cognitive swings can be large. I have POA so have full legal rights to decide care.

I’m worried about communicating too much and causing undue anxiety or even torpedoing the option.

She is excited at the prospect of visiting us and seeing her grandchildren. So we’re considering leaving it at that, then revealing the living arrangements once we’re there.

But even once we’ve cleared the cross country trip, at least, we’re not sure if it’s healthier to start in our house which she knows, then move her, versus going straight to the facility. The downside of being at home would be her getting the impression that it’s a viable option and causing agitation/confusion when we move. The downside of going straight to the facility would be potential for feeling ambushed with the choice. Of course, she may not even understand what’s going on, we may just be able to sell that it’s a temporary stay while we figure out care options.

The care facility itself couldn’t be lovelier. I’m really hopeful she’s going to be happy there, if we can land it.","We told my mom (who we moved locally from her home) that it was a temporary move so the staff could better help her with her various illnesses, one of which was (a very treatable form of) breast cancer. The cancer was no lie but we told her a white lie as to how long she would be in assisted living.  

If you have to lie a little, it’s called compassionate lying (a term I learned on this subreddit). 

Moving is disruptive enough but to do it 2x would really confuse her.

Some suggestions:

1) if you move her to your house for a few days, perhaps take her to the ALF during the day (with her stuff moved into her room) and have her spend a few hours a day there, and stay at your house a few nights. 

2) if allowed and feasible (sofa? Air mattress?) have a family member spend the first couple nights with her at the ALF if she permanently moves in right away.

3) do item 1) and then 2) 

Best of luck!
We have a similar situation. Have you been told they need to live in that state for 6 months to be considered a resident?
I would not temporarily move her into your home, because moving is disruptive, and by moving her first into your house and then into AL you're only prolonging the disruption. My Mom relocated from a house to an independent living facility (with assisted living and memory care units available) in the fall. She has mild- to mid-level cognitive issues, and was actually the one who initiated the move. Because of some timing issues, she had to stay with me for a week and it was honestly one of the hardest weeks I've ever experienced -- and this was just a few months after she visited me for a week with no real issues. Get her settled into her new place ASAP.
If you can get her furniture and bed cover and her pictures on the walls, she's more likely to feel it's home. The big thing is to pay attention to what it *feels* like to her. If it feels okay, that will help. If it were me, I would do one move, not more.
You can start by calling it an extended stay hotel with a dining room. They let us bring some of your furniture so you’ll be more comfortable! We’re not far away so you can call us anytime!
I did this with my mom- we called it “coming to stay for the winter”- I live in a warm climate and she loved this city.

The actual move was not fun- she suddenly decided it was a terrible idea and melted down in anger, tossing beloved items out of the suitcases. My sister and I repacked when her back was turned.   She was anxious and refused to eat for the flights to my house.  But- she loved the place I picked out.  I tried to get something that she would enjoy- being on an upper floor, lots to look out on.  I had some basics already in her place- loveseat sleeper, a borrowed table, a TV and basic kitchen stuff (she doesn’t cook but I had some plates).  Towels and sheets.    

She enjoys decorating so bringing a few items in her suitcase helped and then going out to chose a proper bed, pretty shower curtain etc gave her some feeling of control over the move.

If you can do that with your mom, it helps.  Let her decide where to hang pictures, place lamps, etc.  You might want to talk with her doctor about medication prior to the trip if you feel it may make it easier for her.

Also, heads up- major transitions like moving can cause a sudden acceleration of the dementia.  We saw it happen but please know you are doing the right thing should you witness this.  You are doing right by your mom.",2022-03-13 09:46:37,-emanresUesoohC-,td795y
Dementia,Mum Recently Diagnosed- How Should I Prepare?,"Hi all,

Recently my mum was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia. We were expecting something as she had had sudden body weakness, hand tremors and some confusion around forgetting words at times, but certainly nothing so drastic a diagnosis. She just turned 70. She went through extensive testing so I'm not questioning the doctor at all, but after a weekend of research and emotion, I guess I'm looking for advice as to how to prepare for this sudden new future we have.

I'm an only child, so no siblings to lean on, and our extended family all lives abroad in different countries and are relatively elderly themselves (I'm not close to cousins etc), so there will be little to no support (parents don't want to tell them at the moment anyways). My parents live in Scandinavia, I live in the UK, so I can't even offer support at the moment of being nearby. I know I'll have to have a conversation with my dad about potentially bringing her closer as the disease progresses. We're lucky that at the moment she's still herself, no real memory issues beyond forgetting the odd word, just physical at the moment though she does find it hard to focus at times and the doctor has taken her driving licence.  The question:

Have you got any advice on what I could be doing now to help her and my dad, or even help myself for the long run? I feel like the bottom of my world has fallen out and I've got to find a way to make sense of it and plan. Maybe there's nothing I can do right now but to ride this emotional roller coaster, but any advice you can give me, or if anyone has had to support parents through this from afar as well, would be gratefully received.  TL;DR- Mum diagnosed with dementia, I want to help but in different countries.","Sorry you’re going through it. Sounds like she has the LBD with Parkinson’s. My mother also has LBD., but without the Parkinson’s. It’s different from other kind of dementia so if you haven’t done so already, Google, Google, and Google some more and research. You cannot medicate a LBD patient with Alzheimer’s meds. Mine has just started on hospice. 

Have all of her end-of-life paperwork done while you still can.  Wills, POA, etc. 

you DO NOT want to caretake your mother with this disease. It will go into bowel and bladder incontinence, hallucinations, delusions. So start finding memory care facilities or private care so that when the time comes, everyone will be prepared. You don’t want to keep transitioning her to different environments based on her “stages”, ie assisted living to memory care to nursing home. I am in the US and I Understand you are overseas, so I don’t know what kind of social services for the aging are available but that would also be a good place to start researching on placement and what kind of government services are available.
I'm so sorry. I just got the dementia diagnosis for my partner. I've seen it coming for years, but it still hits like a ton of bricks.

I do not know enough about Lewy Body, UK or Scandinavia to offer anything specific there. There are likely legal and medical access steps that you can take sooner, rather than later. Having some sense of what you will want to do ""when X comes to pass"" often yields better results than waiting for a crisis, and making hasty decisions. 

My first thought, though, is to reach out to find support: therapy and support groups for spiritual fortitude, and reading to prepare you for what to look for and how to respond. Sounds like you're doing the latter, and joining this group is a step toward the former.

Strap in. And: folks on this sub are here for you. 💔
1. Legal and financial paperwork done
2. Funeral prefrences decided 
3. Future care home decided on
In addition to the POA, Medical Directives, and financial info mentioned here, make sure all financial accounts are “Transfer on Death” so you don’t have to go through your country’s probate (or equivalent) process. That includes banking accounts.

Dementia,70th birthday,So my mom's 70th was last week. But this Saturday we had a celebration for her. My family and my brothers family. We all all had a great time. Food and drinks. When we sang her happy birthday I got emotional. All the emotions hit me at thest time. It was great seeing her enjoy herself. It's one of those moments where she knows what's going on and was pleased that everyone was there for her. She was tired but didn't want to sleep because she knew what was going on. We took pics and just enjoyed the moment. Just wanted to share this with you guys.,"Beautiful, thank you for sharing <3
Fantastic!  You have to grab those times when they happen and just soak in the happiness that she is with you at that brief moment in time.
Thanks for sharing, it's good to hear about these lovely moments!
I'm so incredibly happy for you! It's bittersweet, but I'm glad you got the chance to experience it while she's aware. Good luck going forward ❤️",2022-03-13 01:52:31,blacc1,td161p
Dementia,Keeps requesting meds,"I look after my mother in her home for a few days each month. She takes four pills each day; three in the morning and one and night. During the days things are usually okay. However, at night she keeps requesting her daily meds even after she’s taken them. She gets really upset when I try to explain she’s done for the day. I’ve tried everything to calm her down, addressing her worries, changing the subject, even called my dad on video (I’m watching her while she’s at work). But once she’s got her mind set on doing something, she doesn’t stop. She’s come into my bedroom a few times and to wake me up and ask for me for her meds. I was wondering if anyone had any tips for handling something like this. I considered a placebo, but I don’t want to setup a pattern where she begins to expect that too. Any recommendations would be appreciated.","A placebo is where my mind went to at first, as well. But, you're right, you don't want to be re-enforcing her behavior.

What if you kept a 'medicine diary' and had her note the time she took her meds and initial it each day?
I occasionally work as a home nurses aide, which means I visit people with dementia living at home to give them medication, among other things.

This problem is really common! What I had to do in the start was call the on call nurse (because he/she knows the behaviour of the patient in question). 

Then I realized that the statement ""the nurse has told me that you need to take these pills"" or ""the doctor says you have already taken your pills"" works extremely well in many cases. It might even be possible to pretend to call, or have an audio file on your phone saying ""Hi X, I'm your doctor. You have taken the pills you need today"".

Just a suggestion.

PS: I wouldn't worry too much about enforcing the pattern - her ability to form new memories and associations is what is being damaged by her disease.
I've come across this a few times. I work in specialized dementia care and in the first instance we try redirection,  validate her by acknowledging what she is saying 

ah, yes you're evening pills. Do you think you might have taken them already? No worries. I'll check shortly but first I just want to ask you a few things or get you to help me with this etc

Sometimes this works to ""break the loop"" or the fixation she is having. If this doesn't work you can try writing in her diary or on notes the specific time she has to take the pills and have the pharmacy split them in to packets with the prescribed date and time they need to be taken (we call them medrolls similar to blister packs). This can be good as she will be able to see the time and date and hopefully this will help her realise she has already taken them.

If these fail then a placebo can work well. Some GP's can prescribe them other times you can swap them for breath mints or tic tacs depending on how cognitive she is. Sometimes it's the motion of taking something and other times it's the recognition of something familiar. Depends on her specific dementia.

Placebo might sound great but be wary as it can make the situation worse as she may become more fixated on medications.
My Mom is the opposite, saying that she doesn’t need the pills or that she has never taken so many before. I can’t win….
You can buy empty veggie capsules on Amazon. You could fill them with sugar or flour to give the illusion of  medication. Tic tacs are another option.
While it may not be ideal, if she's demanding her pills and it's disrupting her evening habits, you might want to try giving her a Tic-Tac. Several people in a dementia support group I used to be in did that when the situation came up. Some found little decorative candies like you put on cookies and cakes that worked better because the Tic-Tac flavoring was too strong.
We have the boxes with separate compartments for am & pm. If you fill it up once/week, everyone can see that those pills are now gone. I also like the idea of her signing a pill diary.",2022-03-12 23:29:18,mr_agucci,tcyz22
Dementia,Three risk factors that may have the biggest impact on dementia cases,,"It's weird that sleep deprivation isn't even mentioned, I just read a study where it was thought to be the number one factor.  Sleep is the time when your brain clears out the proteins that would otherwise get all tangled up and cause dementia.

And then FSH isn't mentioned either.  Read another study where they were trying to determine why women are more likely to get dementia and they concluded it had to do with hormones after menopause and had great success with FSH blockers... in mice.  

I'm starting to think no one has a clue :(
This is interesting but I doubt we will never fully know. My dad was always super healthy, a good weight, physically active, didn't smoke or drink, didn't avoid doctors, etc. There isn't even a family history. 

My personal theory is it goes back to when he was in his teens/early 20's, he spent many years playing soccer/futbol and rugby. I've heard stories from his siblings about a few times where he was hit hard enough to lose consciousness. Probably had many undiagnosed concussions, too.
There is strong evidence that a large proportion of dementias can be prevented or delayed. A good summary is presented in the paper by Livingston et. al. in Lancet 2020, Dementia prevention, intervention, and care: 2020 report of the Lancet Commission. 

An excerpt from the abstract: ""Overall, a growing body of evidence supports the nine potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia modelled by the 2017 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care: less education, hypertension, hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, and low social contact. We now add three more risk factors for dementia with newer, convincing evidence. These factors are excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and air pollution. We have completed new reviews and meta-analyses and incorporated these into an updated 12 risk factor life-course model of dementia prevention. Together the 12 modifiable risk factors account for around 40% of worldwide dementias, which consequently could theoretically be prevented or delayed. ""

Unfortunately, this does not suggest a cure for dementia. But it does suggest that exposures/behaviors throughout life can reduce risk.",2022-03-12 23:00:08,Ambitious_Pepper5224,tcyhs8
Dementia,Topics to stay away from?,I'm going to visit my grandma tomorrow who has pretty severe dementia. She's currently in the hospital with a pretty bad case of pneumonia. Are there things I should say/shouldn't say? Last time I saw her she still remembered my name but I was informed that she's in pretty bad shape now and may not remember me. I just want to keep her company and make her feel better.,"Keep it light and happy. Avoid things that are stressful or upsetting (politics, the war, etc)

If she asks about people who have passed, just say they aren’t here right now and redirect by changing the subject. Don’t feel like you have to tell the truth of someone who is no longer here because it’s a brand new grief for them every time and essentially torture. 

Tell stories about your life, dreams, friends/family/kids. All from a positive perspective. 

Good luck - loving someone with this disease isn’t easy
Avoid: ""do you remember x?"" instead: ""this is x, your friend from xx."" It may make her feel bad if she is 'supposed' to remember you but fails to. If she doesn't recognize things you mention, just move on.

She may remember her granddaughter as a young child in concept, but not your face. Ask her if she has grandkids, if she mentions your name then just ask her to tell you all her favorite things about Grandkid. You could even offer to dictate a letter to that grandkid.

Play music that was popular when she was a teen!!!
Talk about the things around her. If she has a book nearby, ask about it. Mention you like the color of her top or that photo of family. Ask her what her favorite hot beverage is. Try not to ask her to recall things (as she might not be able to and it can cause frustration). If she says something odd or incorrect, don't question or correct it: just acknowledge and change the subject if possible.  


Most of all try to have fun and make the best of it.",2022-03-12 19:19:32,Snoo-14044,tcunw2
Dementia,Vomiting up her meals. Early stage vasc dementia diagnosis; doc’s say she can live “independently” but today I learned she forgot how to operate the oven.,"Is vomiting a symptom of dementia? Two days in a row she’s vomited up her dinner. She has no nausea, no fever, no incontinence. She’s sedentary all day. She forgets to eat if I don’t provide means. I’m at a loss y’all.","I would look for causes of the vomiting. Is she taking medications correctly? That instantly came to mind when I read this since her dementia may mean she isn’t taking medicine as prescribed. She could also have a physical reason for it. My husband had a huge gallstone that we knew nothing about. He had his gallbladder removed recently and I’m hoping that solves his nausea and vomiting. He’s been doing that since September. We thought it was a certain medicine causing it, but I’m hoping it was the gallstone causing it.

Also, just because a doctor says she can live independently does not mean she really can. Doctors only know what they can see. They can’t accurately judge what her life is really like since they aren’t there to see it.
Bless you. Might dispense her meds daily since she may or may not be taking properly. Keep a close watch as she may be eating something expired. 

I hope you get a POA signed w medical provision. This road we walk is hard but we share the experience.
Other possibility is bad constipation. You can try giving her a laxative if she's isn't already on them to see if that resolves the vomiting.
check for constipation. very common cause of vomitting
Is she producing excess mucus? Worse than reg runny nose? Tis the (allergy) season. Other conditions can cause the goblet cells etc to run amok. Can also make food come back up.
No it’s not 

She needs to see different doctors 

Probably hydration also, must be dehydrated if nothing else 

Take her to the ER
Don’t leave her alone, get her a good cardiologist. One significant heart attack or stroke will make your problems much worse. My mother is bedridden now. I remember the beginning of her diagnosis as a walk in the park now.",2022-03-12 18:05:04,SuchMatter1884,tct9du
Dementia,Useful chores for client with dementia other than folding clothes?,Does anyone know any good household chores someone with mobility issues other than folding laundry? I want to keep her busy and her mind off of missing the home she's sitting in. Maybe if she feels useful it will feel more like home.,"Large bin of unmatched colorful socks.
I would try for increased mobility.  If you have those exercise bands for stretching or the balls for your hands.  Plus there's a bunch of exercise videos for seniors on youtube as well as seated exercises.  Get the music playing etc.

Maybe a jar of coins to sort?  Does she like watercolour painting?  Or paint by numbers?  Or an adult colouring book?  Does she like to clip coupons?  Or articles from the paper/magazines?  That's all I got!
Perhaps let her polish any silver or brass with a non-toxic polish like Blitz?  Even if she doesn't have any, she could ""polish"" the stainless.  

You could also give her a magic eraser and have her clean grimy items like sneaker soles or dirty hard plastics.
I am a Montessori trained teacher for ages 0-3 and 3-6 years and there are a lot of fascinating parallels between these age groups and elderly/dementia care. Even though the website is geared towards preschool age, you might find some good inspiration here: https://www.alldayprimary.com/practical-life also just searching ‘montessori practical life’  online and in social media will give you more ideas. Hope this is helpful!
Sorting socks 100%.
Cleaning out a junk drawer. My mom can spend hours on this. 
Sorting pictures. Make up a way to sort them (vacation or not, maybe) that doesn’t involve knowing people.
This is a little weird, but my mom will spend ages putting the square gum (the kind where each one is in its own pop out pack) back into its pack, and then each pack back in the box. She never eats the gum so we don’t stress that it’s been popped out over and over…
Putting clothes on hangers.
Crafts! Water colors, puzzles. Crochet. Socks for sure. Helping with dishes. Busy stuff. Think of a child. Fidget boxes with sensory toys. Amazon is your friend here! There's busy pillows you can buy but if you're crafty you could make one. Google and pinterest help too there's alot of ideas out there. My grandma loved folding things keeping her hands busy always helped. She was bed ridden so we didn't have alot of options.
My mother will sweep all day. Maybe that?
Watering plants, storing mail (I save a weeks of junk mail so nothing important gets lost), help with the grocery list, putting groceries away, setting the table, feather dusting a room.  With supervision my LO can help in the kitchen tearing lettuce and making a salad with precut veggies.  They can measure ingredients, but can’t read and follow the recipe so this takes a lot of help and patience.  They liked to bake and make bread, so they really enjoy this.
* Clipping coupons from the newspaper. 
* Feeding junk papers (unstapled) into a shredder (under supervision, shredder stored away when not in use). 
* Testing pens, highlighters, markers on paper, and throw away the ones that are dried out. 
* Pulling each clean plate from the dishwasher, drying it with a towel, handing it to you to put in the cupboard.
* Rinsing fruit in the kitchen sink.
* Give her a non-toxic spray cleaner (Mrs. Meyers etc), and a towel. have her spray and wipe off in circles various surfaces around the house. The front of the fridge, the cupboard doors, staircase railing, doorknobs, doors, baseboard/door trim, windowsills, trash cans, faucets. Hopefully there are some random food splashes that she actually gets to see disappearing!
My dad really liked cutting things up with scissors. Maybe cutting photos out of a newspaper or magazine would work.
Have her help with meal prep if you have the space, and if it's part of the chores. 

Wash and tear the Romain salad, etc.
Find out what she used to do for a job and start there
I've heard sorting buttons or other small items, but we haven't tried it.

Folding a basket of washclothes worked for us better than regular laundry.

She used to be able to help with rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, but she's no longer able to stand that long.

She likes to read a large print book-sized monthly magazine. She's starting to tear pages out now, but we have many back issues laying around that it's not a concern now. She will usually read out loud and sometimes that's the most talking she does at a time, even when she doesn't understand what she's read.
Not really a chore but if she can knit I’ve found that’s really helpful.
Folding paper napkins was a favourite here. Having a multiple section box and putting items away in it, but depending on the stage, be careful of giving items too small that could be put in the mouth.
My family member is similar. Doesn’t really read magazines, but likes to skim. Anyway, we’ve found that although her memory is poor, she remembers ALL songs! As soon as we turn on some fun ‘oldies’ she springs to life :)",2022-03-12 17:58:20,CheapTea108,tct4ch
Dementia,I need help,"Hello everyone. I am new to posting here but have browsed this sub recently. I am really mentally struggling right now. 
I have noticed since around November-December that my mom (74) has become increasingly confused and forgetful. She cannot remember what day of the week it is or any dates. The doctor asked her what the year was and she said 2000, but then changed it to 2020. She has also trouble with recalling the name of certain items and she no longer drives. The doctor’s have diagnosed her with dementia but are still trying to determine the type and cause. Tested for UTI (negative), no thyroid issues, no b12 issues.
My mom was the caretaker for my daughter (2 years old) up until I began to notice the memory struggles. She is obviously upset with not taking care of her each day as her (only) granddaughter is her world.
We are in the process of moving my mom in with us. 
All this being said… how do you mentally handle this? I am struggling more than words can express. I am not finding joy in things that I used to and am losing significant weight. My mom was my only family member growing up and losing my mom in this slow process is killing me. I don’t know how I can make it.","I’m so sorry. It is really devastating for a loved one to experience this, and it takes some time to adjust. 

Have you seen your doctor? It sounds like you may need some help for depression, which is totally understandable and common. As caregivers we need to take care of ourselves too. 

Hugs to you.
I would see if their are local organizations that offer caregiver support groups. Your area may have a Department of aging or similar that may have resources. It can be a difficult adjustment for everyone. I care for my Grandma and it took months to adjust to a routine. With each decline it gets harder and after about 4 years of her care, we are looking at a memory care facility. 

The resources listed in the Sub are good ones. Teepa Snow (videos on Youtube) does a good job explaining what dementia is and what they can experience. Plus how we have to adjust our thinking around their behavior. I definitely suggest finding a good support network. I talk with friends who also cared for family with dementia.
That is a really fast decline. Has she gotten a CT scan of her brain? Before assuming it is a permanent condition like Alzheimer's, it is important to rule out reversible things like Normal Pressure Hydrocephaly or a brain tumor. Also make sure she isn't taking some common medications like [Benadryl](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/two-types-of-drugs-you-may-want-to-avoid-for-the-sake-of-your-brain).
Hi there. I am in a similar situation with my mom, though the onset has been slower. She was just diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It's been all I can think about. I don't have answers, but please know you are not alone.",2022-03-12 17:46:42,songmommy,tcsw2k
Dementia,we're finally here (an off my chest post),"I've posted here a couple times before. I've been caring for my mother for the past four years. She has dementia, Dr says probably Alzheimer's. Mid way through last year her POA was activated, she doesn't have any assets and lives off of social security. For four years she has lived with me and I've taken care of her medications, food, laundry, and every other little thing aside from toileting and bathing. Obviously with the nature of dementia I've watched her decline over the years, it's to the point where she doesn't really know who I am half the time but she luckily always seems to trust me. I've been beyond burnt out for the past several months. But working with state assistance programs we finally found an assisted living facility with memory care that is a great fit for her.

Within the next week we will be moving her in. I know with every fiber of my being this is the best decision for her and her health. As well as my health since I really have not been able to take care of myself over the past several months. It sure doesn't make it any easier, she tells me ""my heads messed up but it's not that bad"" and ""I don't need to be in a nursing home"" (she's not going into a nursing home, it's a community based residential facility, assisted living).

She can't make food for herself, can't tell the difference between a TV remote and a telephone most of the time, she doesn't know who her son or daughter is, can't adjust a thermostat without assistance. But I can't be her caregiver anymore, I just want to be her son again nothing more. She also tells me how much she hates being alone, though she's alone a lot of the time. I have to work a full time job I have bills to pay, and selfishly I want to be able to spend time with friends and enjoy hobbies along with going to the gym. 

I know this is the right decision, every single family member knows it is the right decision. The doctors agree it's the right decision. None of that makes it any easier. I'm absolutely terrified of how moving her in will go. I'm an anxious mess, but at the same time I can't wait to have my life back. So many conflicting feelings.","Fwiw, my dad's actually improved a bit since going into memory care. We suppose it's because he's interacting with more people while he's there. He still kind of hates it and ""wants to go home,"" but he said that even when he was home, so....
keep focusing on the positives with her. Assisted living is not like being on lockdown or bedridden, it is like living in a hotel with a restaurant and maid service, and someone to dispense meds. The residents don’t have to make their own food or clean their apartment, they have way more activities and social opportunities. The older generation has this idea of nursing home being like a warehouse for dying people, it’s more like living on a cruise ship. Perhaps you can arrange for some familiar things to go with her like curtains and some of her favorite artwork and photo frames.
Boomer here,  we have the preconceived notion that nursing homes are the horrifying places they were 40 years ago... horrible,  barely a step up for an animal shelter...  

The assisted living places now are decent, activities, etc.  Take your mom to visit,  let her see the activity calendar (I know she won't understand it all ) but maybe it will make it easier for her to accept this is the right thing.   Tell her it will be like living in a resort,  no meals to cook, someone else does the housekeeping, changing the sheets,  laundry,  she can live the life of leisure. 

Good luck!
moving my dad to a care home was the hardest and best decision we made. Wish you luck. You are an amazing son to have taken care of her for 4 years. Take care of yourself.
You are 100% doing the best thing.  
Depending on how far away the ALF is, maybe for the first few evenings, stay with her until she’s ready for bed/fallen asleep.  If it’s the weekend, be there first thing in the AM to be with her.  If that’s not possible with your schedule, maybe consider using a private sitter for a few hours a day, for about a week, to help your mom transition. 

When we moved my mom into an ALF, I felt like I was taking my child to the first day of kindergarten all over again.  I felt so guilty but it was the right thing to do.  

I’m glad you will get some of your life back.  You will still worry but your stress level will decrease. And BTW, the more visitors your mom has, the better.  This tells staff that someone is constantly monitoring things for your mom.
Four years is a long haul, you absolutely deserve to be happy and to ""unpause"" your life after that much time.  I'm the live in caregiver for my mom it's only been about 6 months and I'm looking at another six or so until we get her affairs in order (she had no POA) until we can move her into a memory care home.  I have good days and bad with her but cherish the good ones, I get the laughs where I can get them and figure I can make this small sacrafice for her considering what she did for us growing up.  It'll be bitter sweet when we finally move her into a home and I know part of me will be torn about it, but eventually we have to move on with our lives and know it's for the best and if they had full cognitive abilities we all know that most of our parents would not want us to put our lives on pause for them, I certainly don't want that burden for my kids if the time comes for me.  I'm telling myself, she may not like it at first but will quickly hopefully learn to like it or accept it, and I can move on with my life finally again.  I'm so looking forward to be able to be able to be away from a house for longer than 4hrs at a time.
Same boat here, more or less.  My dad is a little further along the dementia road than your mom, but close.  We can’t really have a sensible conversation with him about the  move to memory care.  He would be totally confused.  Currently he lives in the back house of a 2-house-on-a-lot situation (similar to a duplex) with my sister and her family in the front.  He eats all of his meals with sister, and he can’t have any food in his house because he feeds it to the dog (even soft drinks).  My sister has video cameras all over his house so she can keep an eye on him when he is not with her.  Dressing and toileting are becoming pretty random.  Hasn’t had a shower in months.  We are in the final throes of choosing a memory care facility.  Although he has limited resources, we’ve waited long enough that he should be able to afford 3-4 years or so and it is hard to imagine he will outlive that.  One hurdle we’ve had is his dog, and we’ve found several options that will allow him to have his golden retriever.  That should help with the transition, fingers crossed.  We don’t know how to tell him that this is going to happen.  He won’t understand and, if we tell him in advance, he won’t remember so we’ll have to tell him what he considers bad news over and over.  Most likely, we will have the gut-wrenching experience of taking him there and just basically leaving him.  Even if we told him in advance, it would be the same for him either way.  So, so, so hard.
i’m going through this thought process right now too, but no concrete plans are in place.  i can feel your nervousness right through the screen.

she still recognizes me fine, but she gets the remote and phone confused, she forgets to eat and drink, i handle her medication and bills and doctor appointments, she insists that she can handle everything just fine by herself but then interrupts me constantly while i’m trying to work from home. i look forward to her daily naps so i can get work done.

i have yet again thought of quitting my job (would be my third job to quit in 9 years) simply to be present for her, make her day more cheerful, and take care of everything at home, without constantly resenting her for my job performance decline.  I know it’s my own emotions that are causing the stress, i could try to just not react as much.

I’ve considered many stories and plans (read:lies) to get her into assisted living without emotionally hurting her too much.  and i realized i’m damned if i do and damned if i don’t.  whatever the next step is, it’s going to be painful for both of us.

i wish you so much luck.  i hope things go smoother than expected.  please, please, don’t beat yourself up too much.  you’re handling the welfare of a disabled person, and that makes you the adult.  and being the adult means sometimes you have to make enemies.  it simply comes with the territory.  good luck.
Society preaches self-care but sometimes its not possible in the face of a disease that requires 24/7 care.  It sounds like youve already done so much.  You're making the right choice and its not selfish to want to take care of yourself especially if you are arranging care.  You're a great person for caring and Im sorry this bullshit diseased has touched your loved one.
You have been doing so much for your Mom and now realize it is time to let someone else take over.  No shame in that but it is a letting go process.  Just remember that this is the best for both of you and she will   continue to have all of her needs met.  You have a right to get your life and health back.  Don't be hard on yourself, you've done  great all of these years, find peace in your decision.
This is the right decision.

To be required to give all can break a person/caregiver. You are a good son.
Your mum sounds similar to mine. I’ve been her sole carer since around 2016 when things started to get bad. Managed to keep her able to live independently up until this year. She moved into residential care/memory unit a couple of weeks ago. Definitely brought to the surface a lot of sadness and stress I thought I had gotten over. Clearing out, packing up and cleaning out her old place was really hard emotionally too. The transition has been really hard as well and I keep questioning myself if it was the right thing to do. It has been nice to hand over the reins so to speak in regards to her medication, general health and safety. People often tell you you’re doing a good job and to remember to make time for yourself but I’m not sure where they expect you to pull this time from, especially with kids and a full time job. 😂
I really feel for you. I wish I could help with something other than my aching heart.
The good thing about the type of place you are talking about going with your mother is it they will let you visit whenever you want. Thankfully the days of covid shutdown have for the most part passed and you will be able to visit as much as you like as many times per day is you like. Make sure you have a comfortable place to sit while visiting with her and she will be happy when you visit. The place we took my dad suggested 2 to 6 weeks of a settling in was a normal amount of time. It takes people with dementia much longer to adjust then we do. I think you will find she will enjoy it especially if you can visit quite often. If they're are neighbors or friends or people from church say that would enjoy going to see her (that you feel comfortable with) that would also be great. It will be so much better for you to because you'll be able to visit her as her son instead of her caretaker. Good luck
You absolutely must take care of yourself. It's the right thing to do.",2022-03-12 02:13:12,spacearmadillo52,tcax5q
Dementia,Disability denial,"I tried searching the sub but didn’t see anything related to disability. 

I’m wondering how many people on here have loved ones that were approved for disability based on their diagnosis of dementia? My mother has FTD and we just did her ssi application and I was supposed to have until 3/21 to process the disability claim but they randomly denied it on 3/8 without any medical information input. I’ve been going back and force with one of her doctors who keeps sending me records that aren’t correct due to a computer error. The national number doesn’t pick up even after an hour on hold and my local office legit has their phones off and has had their doors locked since 2020. I’m just wondering how many people had an approval for disability? Did you do it on your own or did you get an attorney?

Edit: she’s only 62 so she isn’t eligible for regular Medicare for a few years","How old is your mother? My dad was in his 80’s so getting disability was moot. Pretty much, these days, you hire an attorney that specializes in disability
FTD is a condition on the Compassionate Allowances List. Did you know that? https://www.ssa.gov/compassionateallowances/

As long as she has a diagnosis of FTD, I wouldn’t expect a problem with approval. On the application, did you specify her FTD diagnosis?
80% of disability applications are denied when 1st submitted. Appeal with all your medical information. Good luck!
Didn't say I had dementia. I had brain surgery and I got approved. They have someone down as my payee though because when I should have been getting ssi I was absolutely useless monetarily.

Approved now. 

I was told it takes more than once to be approved.  It's aggravating but it's a thing.

Good luck to you
My husband has FTD…he was diagnosed at age 58. I had to get a lawyer to push his company’s long term disability policy to accept the claim because they initially denied it. . The lawyer I hired declined to help with the SSD claim because he said I could do it myself and he’d feel bad about taking his cut. 
So I did it all myself and while it took them a year to make a decision, it was approved. If you were starting the process I’d say try it yourself since it wasn’t that bad. 
But since you’ve already had one denial, I’d think getting a lawyer might be a good idea. 
It’s ridiculous how many hoops there are to jump through. Having some help might be a good idea. .",2022-03-12 01:19:23,krabecal,tca56s
Dementia,My 64 year old mother has mild atrophy and cognitive impairment.. what does this mean?,"My mom got fired from her job because of how forgetful she’s been and bizarre her behavior is recently. She has trouble following a conversation and forgets words/ various timelines. She is always confused. She went to the dr and they told her she had bad thyroid problems and that this might be the cause. I was relieved. However after getting an MRI they told me she has mild atrophy. I do however see improvements with her since she took off of work, stopped drinking and is on thyroid medication. The dr just prescribed her memantine. 
Does this mean my mom has Alzheimer’s? Or dementia? I don’t know what’s going on. I’m very scared and sad. Should expect for it to get so much worse?","What region/area was the atrophy seen? If you know that, it may help us point you in a direction for you to research.
Our dad had dementia and a neurologist prescribed Memantine, but he was too far gone. He was in his 80’s
Hi. I don't know how old you are, but I'm sorry you are having a difficult time.

You say your mom went to the doctor and got diagnosed with ""thyroid problems"". Was she prescribed anything else? Hyperthyroidism is serious and can cause psychiatric issues.

It's also very relevant if your mom has been drinking a lot for a period of time - this can also cause bizzare behaviour and brain damage especially if she is not eating right.
This does sound very scary and I'm sorry you guys are going through this.

The drinking and thyroid problems could certainly be major contributors to her memory issues and behaviors.

Mild atrophy at 64 is not unheard of and it's not particularly indicative of anything. That said people with Alzheimer's disease will have a slowly increasingly atrophied brain most of the time.

 Starting memantine will probably do nothing for her memory as this is prescribed to moderate dementia patients well into Alzheimer's disease and is not beneficial to mild cognitive impairment or even mild dementia patients.

Prescribing memantine does not really mean she has Alzheimer's, no.  She would need to be assessed by a neurologist and cognitive testing before that diagnosis should be made, especially at her age.
I’m sorry. My mom had similar symptoms in her mid 60’s. You mention yours has stopped drinking, I think that is great. My mom eventually just got an “alcohol-induced dementia” diagnosis after an mri showed shrinkage all over her brain from poor nutrition and years of heavy drinking. I guess that’s a fair diagnosis but it’s a bit more loose than the specific types of dementia diagnosis people get and I can understand your desire for a more thorough definition.
I encourage you to have your mom evaluated by a physician who specializes in dementia. That person coordinate the evaluation and testing needed to reach a potential diagnosis.",2022-03-11 23:55:37,ystproject,tc8trz
Dementia,Dad went missing for the first and hopefully last time,"My dad went missing for 3 hours today. He has been showing mental decline for a year or so but this is the first time he's 'wandered'. He remembered my sis in laws phone # thank God and knew enough to stay at the hospital until he got a hold of her. How he got there, where he went and why is still a mystery, he had no idea and was clearly shaken up and scared too. He was supposed to go live in an independent living lodge but now it seems that's not going to happen....he probably needs a dementia ward in long term care. He will be staying with my sister in law for now and we can at least share in the responsibility with him coming here for the weekend. Ugh so scary and so stressful 😫 but thank God he wasn't hurt or lost all night.","Is there something he will consistently take?  get a tile and attach it to his wallet,  shoes, whatever he is consistent with.

Dementia,Why hasnt there been a cure found?,"Being the most horrifying way to leave earth, I would've assumed that there have been some breakthroughs, but I overestimate how far science has developed :(","Money. There's no money in dementia. We came up with a vax for Covid in under a year. Governments were tripping over themselves to buy, not to save *us*, but to save the economies that keep them in power. 

And: lobbyists, special interests. There's more money to be had warehousing people in (mostly) understaffed hellholes, with private pay alternatives, than there is chasing after 3-headed unicorns which *might* pay out later. 

And: women. 2/3 of those with the most prevalent dementia, Alzheimer, are women. Nobody gives a rat's patootie about women, at least on a macro scale. Why else would Iowa seek to restrict women with *ectopic pregancies* from getting an abortion? (Fertilized egg lodged in the Fallopian tube—there's  better chance of a woman carrying an elephant fetus to term than an ectopic pregnancy.)

I guess I'm a cynic.
I would say money is a big part of it. But also, dementia is an umbrella term for a range of symptoms with different causes, all affecting the cognitive parts of the brain and we still don’t know exactly how the brain works, not enough to fix this yet. Someone who knows about the medical/science side might be able to shed more light or correct me. Hopefully more advances will be made soon, though. It’s going to be one of the biggest health issues with ageing populations .
Maybe when our elected officials start to be significantly affected or get the disease themselves, they will ramp up the funding for finding a cure.
[deleted]
We don't understand the cause of dementias unfortunately. 

Brain disease is especially difficult to develop therapies for due to the blood brain barrier and the fact that the brain is an organ that behaves very differently on the cellular level than other organs.
Also, currently there is no blood test or tissue test that can provide a definitive diagnosis. Everyone’s experience is similar but different enough that creating a diagnostic tool is extremely difficult.

My mom has what they think is Lewy body dementia. Roughly early mid-stage. My mom (85), compared to many others in her assisted living facility is very upright, she doesn’t need mobility assistance, is still capable of personal self-care, she is very social and if one met her for the first time and in a brief interaction they would think her memory problems aren’t that bad other than repeating herself a lot. 

Until they discovered that she can’t follow very basic instructions even those in picture format; can’t make the simplest connections that A leads to B and by that I mean if her apartment is too warm, she doesn’t take the next step to either turn down the heat or open a window. She can no longer independently write a check and no longer understandings that email is not sent to a specific device. 

Her understanding of how the world works is very much like a small child. For example, when she moved she was surprised the post office didn’t notify all her account holders that she moved. I really tried to reason that out with her so she could come to the conclusion that the post office just forwards mail. She seriously thought the post office would contact the Social Security office, credit card companies and other such account holders and provide them her new address. She swore up-and-down that this is what the post office would always do when she moved in the past, that she never had to contact any businesses, that the post office “took care of it all.” I asked her, how did the post office know all of your account numbers? Her response was “I don’t know but they just did.” Eventually I just agreed with he because she was getting more frustrated, and no matter how simply I broke it down, she was never going to be able to come to a logical conclusion. 

Sorry, didn’t mean to get so wordy here. Short answer, there’s no definitive test and no direct, expected path of disease progression.
I don’t imagine there is an actual cure once it sets in, dementia can be slowed down before that though.
Dementia is a syndrome describing around 80-90 actual diagnoses. There is no silver bullet bc nature doesn't work that way. Solving one won't solve the remaining 89.
I saw in a block of vintage 80s commercials a few days ago a commercial about an upcoming (then) news special on how they were sure they were close to a breakthrough... In 1988. 

At this point one of two things is happening... There actually is no cure and little hope on the horizon for one or there's more money to be made in marketing the slow down drugs. Because the snake oil salesmen are still rampant and when a real cure comes along they move on to something else.",2022-03-11 21:27:04,kumori_77,tc6cos
Dementia,Lorazepam for anxiety and outbursts?,"Hi all, i was wandering  if anyone has had luck with Lorazepam for Dementia sufferers anxiety,anger and outbursts? Grandmother was prescribed it but havent tried it yet.  Ty","Yes Our dad had dementia. He would ""sundown"" pretty bad at night or would stay up all night quite anxious. His doctor prescribed 0.5mg, one at night. If he was really anxious we could give him an extra. We didn't like to do that very often because it made him very sleepy.

 He was never ""doped up"".
This has probably been prescribed ""PRN,"" as needed (with an upper limit). It might be worth starting with half the dose, and see where that gets you.

Disclaimer: I'm not a medical doctor, and you probably shouldn't take internet strangers' advice on medications. Call your doc or his/her nurse if you have doubts..
Yes!. Just so you know if they won't take it there is a cream form of it that you can rub into the inner wrist like lotion. You have to ask for it though. It helps so much for those moments of high anxiety, agitation and restlessness
""Lorazepam, sold under the brand name Ativan among others, is a benzodiazepine medication. It is used to treat anxiety disorders, trouble sleeping, severe agitation, active seizures including status epilepticus, alcohol withdrawal, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. It is also used during surgery to interfere with memory formation and to sedate....""

It makes dementia patients ""calm down"" because it will make them forget everything in the near-term. Whether that causes them agitation in itself, or agitation as they recover from that fog of memory, is very individual. 

It also made my dad quite sleepy. If it's being used PRN/as needed more than say, 4-5 times a month, eventually our PCP started to get nervous about renewing the prescription and asked us to find a proper elder psychiatrist/specialist who could prescribe other psychoactive medication to help calm.",2022-03-11 20:44:55,OneTrippyTurtle,tc5mlk
Dementia,does anybody here have experience with NHS Continuting healthcare assessments?,"Mums been discharged from hospital and is now bedbound. Is delirous, has carers 4 times a day to help with double incontinence, and needs feeding. Feeding can take 50 minutes to eat a sandwich, and 20-30 minutes to drink a cup of juice. All feeding is by hand by myself or siblings. All household duties are caried out by myself daily as i do not live there. 

Local council is now asking for full financial assessment but no NHS continuing healthcare assessemnt has been carried out

Does the healtcare asssessment have to be carried out before the financial assessemnt to pay for the care?

Does anybody have any advice?","Don't get me started on CHC!

Financial assessments and continuing healthcare are two different things. The assessment is just to look at how much money she has to see if she has to pay for her own care. The vast majority of people do have to pay, Continuing healthcare (CHC) is a specific funding when someone's needs are medical, not just care based. I was advised to apply for CHC for my dad due to his advanced dementia, incontinence, complex medication needs (he's on anti-psychotics and sedatives), skin condition, inability to move independently and blindness.

I'll be entirely honest the process of applying for CHC is an absolute nightmare, it takes months and months and you probably won't get it.

The first step is to have a 'checklist' assessment carried out. My dad had his in September last year That then triggers a full MDT meeting with social services - mine was with 6 people and took 4 hours. You have to go through a range of concerns and the person has to meet the threshold for enough of them to qualify. It turns your loved one into a tick box exercise. My dad met the thresholds but it was still refused straight away.

That was in November. I appealed against the refusal straight away and social services lost it. It's still not been finalised. Despite his severe care needs, there is absolutely no urgency and social services have targets which mean they are under pressure to refuse applications. I feel like they make it as difficult and distressing as possible to apply so you give up, but I'm too bloody minded to quit at this stage!

Alzheimers Society is a really good source of info on this sort of thing: [https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-support/help-dementia-care/nhs-continuing-healthcare](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-support/help-dementia-care/nhs-continuing-healthcare)

Dementia,My mother has dementia and her doctor is doing everything she can to put her into a home. I don't know how to tell mom that she has lost her independence. Any suggestions?,,"I'm sorry you're going through this, OP.

It was suggested to me that if it would be news better taken from the doctor, then you can absolutely ask the doctor to be the one to tell them that they now need a level of care that family can no longer provide for them at home.

I don't know if that would help you out, but I do think that in my Mom's case, she'd take it better from her doctor because she sees doctors as authority.

Good luck, OP.
One of the biggest characteristics of dementia is that the person with it has little to no insight into their condition, and has lost the ability to learn anything new, so reasonable explanation will go nowhere. 

I have been a nurse in a dementia specific facility, and we are trained in ‘kind lies’ - for example a patient ‘forgets’ that their parent died a decade ago, so when they ask us about their parent’s whereabouts we reassure them that their parent is safe and is just away on a holiday, or staying with a sibling, or anything that fits what we know of the patient’s history. 
Sometimes the patient’s family will tell them that the parent (or spouse, etc) is dead and the poor dementia sufferer will go through the pain of grieving and confusion again and again each time they are told. They cannot retain the true information so are put through needless emotional pain. 

You may have to use reassuring stories with your parent depending on how advanced their dementia is. Often families present being placed in care facilities as needing short term hospital care, or a holiday while their house is painted, or call it a health resort, especially if the patient is resistant.
I’m sorry you’re going through this. I am in a similar situation and hoping to see others’ responses as well.
oh dear.  we told my mum that in a few days time, she and dad (both dementia) would move to a residence... on the day she insisted that she did not know,  we didn't tell her, we sprung it on her.. she would not dress to go and walked around the house all day crying... I had to gently dress her myself.  My brother and I were both in tears.. it took all day. one of the worst days of my life.

tearing up just now recalling it..

I'm afraid I don't have any advice.. good luck.
My siblings and I may the decision to take care of our dad, 24/7 in his home. We did it for 2 1/2 years, he died in June. He would ask if we were spending the night and we would just say yes, then he just got used to us being there. Pre covid, he had a hospital stay, due to lethargy and an unspecified infection. We again, took turns, staying with him round the clock, he did get confused and disoriented. He went to rehab for 8 days, but fortunately, my aunt was on the same locked unit where he was, which was helpful. His primary care doctor was extremely helpful and educated and supported us when it was time for hospice.
We have just begun touring memory homes for my Grandma. One lady we spoke with gave examples of what some of the families had said. One was that they were going to a resort and they responded well to that description.

Depending on the facility, they do try to focus on the things they can still do to help them maintain some independence it seems. Maybe phrase it as a smaller, safer home where she won't be alone. That way she can have help when she needs it and maybe find herself helping others.
I just went through this with my dad. And, I wish I could tell you that it wasn’t as bad as I expected. I expected it to be horrible and… It was horrible. 

He argued that he was just fine and didn’t need any help but we just couldn’t let him off the hook this time. And, it was pretty devastating for him. As a strong independent person, the news that his independence is lost was a hard one. And, he is still reeling honestly. 

But, if there is one benefit to Dementia it is that he no longer remembers to hold a grudge or stay angry. He is dealing with his new reality and things are better for him now. He still not happy about it but I think he is coming to accept it.

Be honest and straightforward with your mom and you’ll get through this discussion. It is difficult though.
It’s not going to be easy, you may have to explain it a few times. My mom was ok with it a first but once she was in she stared to get confused and made her dementia so much worse. She got physical with the staff and verbally abusive, it got so bad we had to have her involuntarily committed to a mental health facility so they could get her meds correct. I really believe the change in setting is what lead to her quick death, she lasted only 5 months in the facility, all this during COVID as well. I hope all goes well for you and your mom.
It doesn't matter what or how you say it, she will still go to the front door every evening to try to get out and go to a home that no longer exists. It's so heartbreaking.
Explain it as an opportunity not a loss. In moving she will have opportunities to…and pick some things from the facilities activities calendar that may be of interest. 

She may say but I don’t want to do those things. You can respond with it’s not a matter of wanting to do them it’s that options are there for you to be able to do more than you are now.

For my mom we really emphasized that she would have weekly cleaning of her apartment. That was really a big deal for her.

Also, don’t be surprised if she complains about there not them not doing anything, that everyone just sits around. That seems to be a big platform my mom is on. “They never do anything here.” Yet the activities calendar Monday through Friday is packed full of things to do. If I put the question to her what do you want to do, often there isn’t an answer. Or if I suggest, well then start a group that does that, she just looks at me like a sprouted a third eye.

Granted, there are a lot of people that are at a stage in the disease where they can’t do much but sit around. I try to appeal to her compassion and say isn’t it nice you were still able to do XYZ. She agrees when I say it, but I don’t know that it really sinks in. I think the level of understanding is very toddler like, and with toddlers it’s me, me, me.
You are in an incredibly tough position.      
First off I want to applaud you for caring and listening to your mom's concerns. 
Is there a way you could call it ""shared housing"" or something similar?        
Maybe put the emphasis on it being for your peace of mind, you could even say that if several months in that she doesn't need it you can look into other options.
Depending on your mom’s condition, it won’t matter what you say.  The comments on here about explanations being nearly impossible were certainly correct in our case.  Mom had questions on the day she moved in to memory care, and we answered those as best we could, but there’s no way to make it ‘right’ with them.  Best of luck to you and your family and I hope this all resolves in a way that brings you peace and grace
Been at the hospital for over an hour so far. She's very confused but able to express herself.  Time loss is not critically impaired as of right now. She can recall names and places and emotions. She has a very hard time figuring out how to express her thoughts but does eventually get her point made. She cried about the dog but understood why he is being adopted away from her and I told her it isn't her fault or punishment.  She thanked me. She does want a few things to keep when she goes to long term care. She wants her stories and poems and stuff to be seen by people,  which I can only assume she means to get published,  but no clue how to do that. She explained that going from incredibly intelligent and verbose to a mental cripple was crushing.
Since none of you are actually there, where your mom is, you won't need to tell her ""she has lost her independence"". She didn't do it on purpose!! It's not a punishment!! Its not willful on her part... its for her safety ffs :(! In any case, she will certainly understand it when they remove her from her home. If she doesn't, then she wouldn't have if you did tell her anyway. Why do you feel it's necessary for you to call her and tell her something like that? It seems unnecessarily cruel to me :(

Dementia,Hiding from people?,"Hi guys!

We recently have done a trial run with a caretaker to just hang out for a couple of hours and socialise with my dad/make sure he doesn't go outside by himself/basically keep him company while I do homework for my classes. She's from church, and she knows him and he said he knew her, so we figured it'd be alright. But now when she's actually here, he hides in his room and doesn't come out until she's gone. One time he came out she managed to coax him out she talked with him for about an hour or so, and I thought that was okay. But the next day she came and he saw her, she said ""Come out and we can chat as friends :)"" and he just said ""I don't want to talk to you."" 

My dad used to be a social butterfly, and he liked talking to everyone but nowadays he mostly spends time in his head or talks to his hallucinations.  Is it normal for people with dementia/Alzheimer's to withdraw like this? Just wondering if anyone has any similar experiences!","Yes, totally normal. Sounds like he's at the stage of still having some awareness of his situation, so hiding in his room is the easiest way to avoid making mistakes in front of someone he doesn't know super well.
In my experience it’s normal for them to be wary or rejecting of caregivers but not easy to deal with. My mother did really like one of her in-home caregivers though (while kicking others out or hiding like your dad) so it isn’t necessarily universal, it might just take some getting used to, or depend on the person.
Give it time. Once she's ""part of the furniture"" he'll adjust. My mom hated that a friend of the family started coming to spend the day with her. She didn't know she been hired to do so, but after a couple of weeks, she accepted the daily ""visits"" and allowed the lady to cook for her, etc. without a fuss.
My dear partner was a social butterfly too. Now hides from everyone. Has brief phone conversations with a select few. But they have to call her. She tells them ""everything is peachy keen, living the good life."" They've been shocked when I tell them she's got dementia. Seems to be ashamed to let on what's really happening; perhaps trying to maintain some shred of her old self as reflected in someone else's eyes. (Edit, spelling)
My personal belief is that as they developed more dementia symptoms, they get MUCH more in tune with other people's ""vibe"" and like dogs, they can tell a good one from bad. 

Maybe not even ""good"" or ""bad"" but just ""compatible"" or ""uncompatable"". A lot of people ARE really nice people but may suffer from depression or sadness underneath their public facade and our LO can ""sense"" it. Another thing is when people are being fake...my dad can DEFINITELY tell and immediately shuts down. 

Maybe when a LO acts strange around someone, we could look a little deeper. Ex: some kids just don't like a relative or caregiver and we don't know why. They don't either; but come to find out later, the person was a pervert or bad in some other way.... Anyway, just my two cents.",2022-03-11 16:34:10,mochirepresentative,tc0pro
Dementia,No more driving,"For those of you who have gone through taking car keys away from a loved one with Alzheimer’s, what are some tips you can give to make the transition easier from driving to no longer driving?  My mother lives in a very rural area with not many options for in home care as she is so far away from larger cities. We want to keep her in her home as long as we can but we worry with her being so far away with no neighbors to help if needed. Appreciate your suggestions!","If there's no one there eventually she'll fall and won't know what to do. Only you and family can have a feel how close she is to something like this happening. How often is she being looked in on?

Another problem is getting injured like a cut or scrape and nothing being done.
I would install security cameras throughout the house (and put them where she can’t mess with them or unplug them).  Perhaps get a doorbell camera for you and your other family members to interface with (your mom may not understand how to use the app, and y’all can tell potential solicitors/scammers to get lost via the app).  Place some at key points outside where you could see her if she’s in the yard.
I live in a very rural area. I’m literally one dirt road from cattle fields. Now the County has a county bus to take seniors to stores and doctors for a very nominal fee based on income. Look up the county she’s in and look at their website. Look for transportation and call them to see if they have anything like that. Also look up Elder Options and see if they have any near her or in a neighboring county and call them. Google and the phone are going to be your friends.
As for actually taking the keys... you can avoid a lot of argument by doing something to the car such as: filing the key down enough that it won't work in the ignition, disconnect the battery, let the air out of the tire(s), etc...
I agree with the broken battery thing and then you offering to get the car fixed for her but then never bring it back.

Thats what we did for my dad except his cqr qctualpy did break down.  We told him the repair guy said the car was beyond repair and he totaled it for us already.  Dad did want to buy a new car bu t we said no and he could no longer do it on his own.  Threw tantrums for a while but way easier than other options.
If her house is big enough, I would try to find a live-in aide. Are you in the US and if so, looked into the Medicaid waivers?

The newer [Apple watches](https://www.apple.com/watch/) have a fall detection feature. You designate emergency contacts and if it senses that she fell down, it alerts those contacts if she doesn't say she's ok. The Alexa Drop-in feature may also be an option, if she has internet at home.",2022-03-11 15:09:02,Cbark2580,tbyw6f
Dementia,QUESTION,"When people with dementia remember something, whether it be they are told or just happen to remember, do they remember like it’s something new and shocking or do they remember like “Oh yeah, I forgot” as if they have always known and just forgot recently?","It depends where in their life the memory happened. If a memory comes up for my mother that was lived pre-dementia then it’s an ‘oh yeah, I forgot’.  If the event happened recently then it’s like finding out for the first time.
I've seen both happen with my mother. But dementia symptoms vary between people, and they also change over time with the same person.
My mom does both, like it’s the first time we’ve told her and the other times it can be a cover up - trying to pretend she remembers when she really doesn’t. She thinks she’s being so sneaky.
I've seen my mother do both.
With my husband both ways happen,.
Both. In the early stages, they often use humor to save face as well. But even events that happened a couple decades ago can be new and shocking for the first time. It is why it is recommended not to tell them that a deceased loved one they are searching for has died. The grief they suffer from learning it, is raw and fresh like new every time.",2022-03-11 12:29:42,stroshasakey,tbv7ab
Dementia,Grandchildren caring for their Grandparents,I’ve been part of this forum for a few months now and I noticed that many of the caregivers here are the grandchildren of the dementia patients.  I feel for these folks who have such a heavy burden at such young ages.  It was hard enough for me as a middle aged person to manage my mom’s care.  I hope they can get the support they need for such a hard job.,"It kind of makes sense in a lot of cases. Parent works, grandchild doesn't, grandparent needs help, there's not a lot of funding, it seems like the perfect match. It's not, but it seems like it. Then you have the grandparents who raised the kids because the parents were out of the picture for whatever reason. It's not fair to the grandchild or the grandparent in many cases. I've seen so many angry, impatient 20-somethings on here ranting about their grandparent with dementia lying and even when they're told it's not intentional lies, they argue that Grandma knows what she's saying and is just being mean. They don't understand. It's not a great situation for either.
This was me. Caring for my Grandma with dementia for fourteen months. She passed away on the fourth of june last year. I was her caregiver providing her with all three meals, helping her in the bathroom, to her bed, just all of her daily care. Being here for her at all times of the day, even at one o’clock in the morning and whenever she needed me. I loved all of it, even if it was challenging at times. (Which was not very often)
I started caring for my grandmother in my 40s. She raised me and has custody of me since before I started kindergarten, so she's actually more like a mother to me.",2022-03-11 11:35:13,Karsten760,tbu0ih
Dementia,"Small insight, sundowning reason, mindreading","My lovely wife sundowns… in the morning. When I'm pre-caffienated to make things worse (like, 7 a.m. so don't try to suggest I wake up to slam coffee earlier). She's waitlisted for Adult Daycare, and meanwhile goes to group therapy, mostly to get her out of bed & to socialize. 

Pitches a b*tch *every* morning. ""Don't wanna go! I'll do self-harm! Aaaagh."" Like getting a cat in the carrier to go to the vet.  Why does she hate therapy so much? And return from therapy in a far better mood every time?

Was reading *The 36 Hour Day.* Suggestion there: figure out what's *really* twonking the loved one, rather than what they struggle to *say* is bugging them.

Ah-hah! She was kicked out of home as a young adult, 2/3 of a lifetime ago. Still haunts her. So what she's really fearful of is not ""going to therapy,"" but getting locked out when she returns home. Addressed that concern with reassurances, and the morning went a bit more smoothly.

Not sure I can keep up the Hail Mary Hat Trick mindreading act, but there it is. Hope this helps someone else.","What a curse to have a memory disease, but not forget the childhood trauma, but also to lose the ability to verbalize your fears.
Would it reassure her to have a key?  Doesn't have to be a real key (and probably better if it isn't, just in case) but if part of the routine is ""here's your key to get back in the house when we come back"" maybe she would feel more in control.
With my dad, we lived in whatever world he was in on that day. He absolutely had to have his keys when he left the house, so we made a set with a hook on the fridge so he knew where he was. He needed money, so we put 5 one dollar bills in it. When we were in the store, he pulled it out to pay, but understood when we said "" we got it dad"". He would want to put on his coat until his ride came to pick him up for work. We let him fall asleep with his coat on. If he was sundowning too bad in the evening, we had low dose Ativan to use
Small victories are worth celebrating. Thanks for sharing your insight.
I’ve never heard of that book; adding it to my list. With my aunt, it’s showers and soap; maybe I can learn something that would help me.  Happy you were able to make your life a little bit easier. We all deserve to have our morning coffee in peace. 🌻
I also felt, that reassuring the Person is loved and missed when they are away often takes the edge off. They are so unsure about everything in their lives, that i feel they need to feel they have a safe haven to return to and someone is having their back and just loves them. Wish you good luck with your approach!",2022-03-11 11:26:27,108beads,tbttce
Dementia,Rapid decline around the end,"It's weird because my grandmother had dementia for over 10 years.  It was progressing but slowly. First episodes, confusion, some irrational behavior but she was still her. Then she forgot how to cook, forgot to bathe, and forgot to eat. My parents took her in a year ago to be her caregivers. It progressed to incredibly fast, so so fast. She went through Covid as well which I hear makes things worse but still. Every month was worse than the last. Her memories were gone, she became extremely agreeable to everything, started eating things that were not food, forgot when she ate and was always trying to ear more,she had to be spoon fed and she had to use diapers and was 80% bedridden. Then she had a stroke. My grandma passed away yesterday. I just wonder, did we do something wrong here. Is it normal to just decline so so fast? She was 91 years old but I don't know if age has anything here.","Also want to mention; my 90 y/o grandmother died on Tuesday morning. It is slow and then quick at the end. She was also declining rapidly week by week. One month ago she was up and walking around (with a lot of assistance to get her upright and on either side) but sleeping some 18 hours a day. Then she was no longer able to stand up at all, even with a lot of help. Then she was not able to consistently hold food in her hand and bring it to her mouth. Then she couldn’t hold food at all, but would swallow if spoon fed. By now she was sleeping 20-22 hours a day. Then she couldn’t do talk or swallow on her own reliably anymore. Over the weekend, she slept. She ate the last time, tapioca pudding, on Saturday. 

Details on the final hours below, may be graphic. 

>!Sunday evening, she began doing that “death rattle” breathing, but only when she was laid back flat. On Monday, she was doing the gurgling sound a little bit, while sitting upright. The CNA (who was a doctor in her home country) said she’s in the last 72 hours, this was Monday around noon. My mom and brother changed her diaper at 11pm. At 1:30 am I went to give her more morphine for the evening. She was breathing unevenly, eyes open but glassy, snoring/gargling sound, and almost making seizure movements with each breath. !< I cried and told her it was ok, we will miss her but will be ok, she has permission to go. My brother popped in to check on her, at 7:30 am on Tuesday, and found her gone.
I think this is just part of the disease.  My mom (she died early November 2021, almost 88) would decline, then be stable for a while, decline again, be stable, and this repeated over several years. Covid Lockdown didn’t help. But she was still getting out of bed and eating decently as of mid-Oct, and then as October progressed, she stopped eating solid food, and it was getting harder and harder to get her out of bed. Her vitals continued to be normal, but in retrospect, she was definitely shutting down. It’s all part of the disease. I’m sorry for your loss.
Towards the end the decline goes pretty quickly. I'm sorry for your loss.
Nobody did anything wrong. When the patient becomes bedridden, they become more susceptible to other health problems because their body isn’t moving around. Bedsores (skin wounds which could become infections), pneumonia, blood pressure, UTIs. Then the body and immune system is basically being attacked on all fronts. While the brain is also working very hard trying to fight back against the dementia, it’s like how you have to work harder peddling a bike if the parts become rusty. It’s nobody’s fault.
I think a quick end is a blessing.  My dad had been pretty stable for about 6 years after diagnosis.  Then he showed slow but steady decline for about 2 years.  Now, this last 6 months, he is going down pretty fast.  Still, at 86, he is still trucking along but with less and less cognition.  Assuming that he  continues to decline at the current pace, I suspect he will be gone within 2 years.  But, who knows?  Frankly, I hope for sooner than later because he is miserable.  I know he doesn’t want to continue like this.
You absolutely did your very best. If something did slip through the cracks, it's not you fault because none of us are ever going to be able to catch everything OR even know what to know to catch. There are so many things that interact with an individual, that we cannot possibly know what to do to prevent bad things from happening.. All the things; meds, environment, personal beliefs, wishes, fears, religion, electrolytes, blood pressure swings, nerve endings, skin wounds, food, germs, etc... Also, we don't know what we don't know... that's why groups like this are so good. My motivation to still be here even after my LO passes is strong. To share what we have collectively learned is invaluable to others. I'm so sorry for your pain and pray for your family's comfort and peace through it all.",2022-03-11 11:07:00,Alicex13,tbtdwy

Dementia,Friday humor?,"Sometimes on Fridays we share the humor we find in the situation of caring for those with dementia.  It can be dark humor, because it can be a dark situation.  And the humor's unlikely to be understood by people who haven't been here.  No offense intended to anybody including those we're caring for.

(Sorry, I've got nothing.  But go for it...)","Lately I've been feeling guilty about not seeing my dad.  I've been working a project at home that has consumed most weekends, but I finally went to see him last Sunday.  There were at least 4 times that he discovered I had come to visit so I'm counting it as 4 separate visits to assuage some guilt.
Not particularly funny, but some positive news! 

My mom started adult daycare this week. We've been positioning it for months as a way for her to ""volunteer"" and use it to rebuild her resume because she still thinks she will eventually go back to work. She's late-middle stage Alz, so that's not going to happen, but the idea makes her happy so we roll with it. 

Anyway, the first day finally came, and she fought my dad for FOUR HOURS that morning about going. She didn't want to shower, didn't want to go, didn't understand why she didn't have a piece of paper with her ""job description"", didn't like the outfit he'd picked out for her, etc. We were all terrified that it wouldn't go well. 

At the end of the day, I called to ask her how it went. Her response? ""Oh, I had some meetings with a new team today. They were really good about doing exactly what I told them. I think they'll learn quickly!""

And she went back happily two days later to ""lead her new team."" :)
My mom and her next door neighbor at the assisted living facility stopped to chat outside her room and they spent the next 10 minutes trying to figure out how they know each other. Church? No. Neighboring town? No. Hmmmmm…….
My dad said he was going to go somewhere. I asked where and he said he didn't know. I said, well let me know when you decide. He said ""ah, thanks a lot smart ass"". He wasn't being mean, he was being sarcastic and it was super funny because he had an expressive tone of voice (usually does not).

My dad has always been a womanizer (hence 2 divorces) but also very charming and funny and I don't hold it against him. Different standards back in the day and all... anyway... 

I took him a small stuffed toy cat as something to hold when he gets fidgety. The other day, he had tremors pretty bad so I handed him the cat and turned away for something. Next thing, the cat fell to the floor next to me. I was surprised and jokingly said ""did you just throw that cat at me""? Quick as a wink, he came back with ""well, everyone needs a little p#$$y thrown at them once in a while""!!!! 🤣🤣🤣

As crude or sexist or whatever... I LOVE these glimpses of the sarcastic, jokester, life-of-the-party kind of guy he always was. Any show of a sense of humor makes me feel good and when we can laugh together, I know he is happy too. My brother is gloom and doom all the time and he constantly asks why I'm so focused on trying to improve Dads physical health when we all know he is NEVER going to ""recover"". It's because he DOES still enjoy some things and as long as HE is still engaged, I will be too :) 

Thanks for sharing and hoping for a restful night ahead for all of us...
My daughter and her girlfriend brought home their bearded dragon and it's tank just the other day. My mom was sitting here on the edge of her bed and out of the blue she says well, I'm gonna go look at the lizard. I'm not gonna touch it but I'll look. She goes to the tank and looks in, talks to it for a second then walks back in muttering to herself yep I'll just look, I won't touch it. 🤣🤣 just the way she was saying it I was laughing so hard.  She now reports to us that it is still hiding to sleep in the morning but that she can see her tail and she also lets us know when it wakes up and comes out of hiding.
This just goes to prove how amazing y'all are. You take care of people, your loved ones, who were once vibrant and self-sufficient but now require an extraordinary amount of constant care and supervision. Yet, you are here among this community, looking to share a light-hearted moment and bring a smile to others. Heroes. All of you. Nothing short of heroes.
My mom enjoys receiving the St. Jude stickers and pads in the mail. But they have her address number wrong. She wrote back to them saying she would be willing to donate if they updated her address and send her more address labels 🤦🏻‍♀️
My mom had been increasingly off for a couple of years but fiercely in denial. She had heatstroke in June and was hospitalized, diagnosed with brain cancer. She was put in palliative care being very agreeable, opposite to her recent temperament and totally bedridden. She was living in hospital gowns so we got rid of her clothes. She believed she was at a resort, presenting at a conference and the nursing staff were volunteers helping out. After three months she “graduated” into longterm care and the first thing staff asked for were clothes! So off to the second hand store to pick up some more. My sister and I went in twice a day for 9 months to feed her and she seemed like we were familiar to her but didn’t know who we were. She was by now non-communicative beyond yes or no , sometimes. But whenever a staff showed up at her door greeting her, she would perk up and smile, saying “hi”, more response then we had gotten in at least 6 months. She passed a couple of weeks ago, just fell asleep. She got wonderful care and my sister and I chose to take turns feeding her as we are both retired and had the time so we were lucky.
My mom has been confabulating memories. Most recently she was proposed to and one of the people in her building (a 93yr old man) became an ""investigator"".


 My sister recently got engaged and my mom loves detective novels.

Dementia,Fast decline after a fall and I’m so lost and tired.,"I so rarely get personal online, but I just have to vent this before I burst. 

My mom started showing signs that I saw about 9-10 months ago that dementia was creeping in. You all know the deal - the repeated stories, the forgetting things, confusing timelines a little, and agitation when anyone tried to help her do anything - but she was still very much in control and lucid. She was in denial, as I’d asked her about the memory loss several times and she just brushed it off, but she’d just have moments. She was still running the show. 

Saturday she fell and suffered a subdural hematoma. It’s been a sharp decline since then. 

The bleeding has stopped, she’s physically well, but she’s completely lost in her mind. Adding to this is the fact that I had not been able to see her in 4 years owing to living 600 miles away and COVID. (We had a trip planned to visit in August 2020 to see her for the first time in a couple of years… so you know how that went.)

Last week I talked to my mother and she was excited she’d found a new primary care doctor that she really liked, that she and my 83 year old step father were given a pretty clean bill of health for their age, and we talked about a lot of things. She said I love you at the end of the call like always. 

I drove 9 hours to come see her yesterday, knowing she was confused after the fall but my stepfather sugar coated what he’d told me a lot. I’m not angry - I completely understand why he’s in the state he’s in. But I just wasn’t quite prepared for today. 

Today I saw her for the first time in 4 years and she sort of registered who I was, but kept telling me she had to get off the phone and go cook dinner, and I didn’t even get the normal I love you from the end of calls. And it only got worse after that - that’s one of the laugh to keep from crying bits. Later she bit and scratched me because she was very angry that I would not take her home, and I’m currently trying very hard to get some tiny bit of rest in a chair next to her bed in the care facility, because she is just relentlessly trying to get up and go home after repeatedly stripping off any clothing we try, she’s completely unstable on her feet, and we were advised against bed rails bc she is super agitated and would hurt herself on them more likely than not. So I’m exhaustedly keeping vigil until my stepdad comes back in the morning. She keeps telling me I’m her good baby boy and it’s time to go to bed. I’m her only child; her daughter. Her dog is the good baby boy she’s talking to. 

I’m so tired and broken. My stepfather is just lost in a haze and can’t face the reality. I’m so sad I didn’t get to see her when she could see me. 

I have so much to do and I can’t stop crying. The doctors have said that she may regain some lucidity, but it’s unlikely we will get her even back to a week ago and that most likely she won’t be in control. 

I have some resources to lean into and we’ve been lucky enough to receive excellent medical care; I knew this was coming in a way, and I’ve checked out this sub and other research a few times to confirm what I was thinking and trying to keep an eye out for when it was time to step in. But I was not ready for this sudden change. I thought I had more time. We had a trip planned in October hoping to be in a semi-post COVID world enough to feel safe seeing them. I’m shattered. 

Oh also my actual father has pulmonary fibrosis and prostate cancer and likely won’t make it til April. His mind is still sharp but that’s almost a curse at this point as his body fails completely. My step mom is taking great care of him, but it’s just so much grief to bear at once. 

I’m not sure where I’ll find the strength to get through this. I know I will, I just cannot figure out where it’s gonna come from right now.","I'm sorry you're going through this.  You're an incredible daughter and your mother is lucky to have you.  She def needs care at this point as she could be a danger to herself and others. Im so sorry you're dealing  with this. It sucks.
I just went through this. Find your village. Delegate tasks. Make lists. One step one day one hour at a time. Took exactly 9 weeks, I got mom moved into a faculty and moved her out and sold the house to pay for her. I could never have done it without friends and neighbors to help and support me. Very lucky for my village and I had to create new villagers to help as well. Don’t be afraid to ask for help
So sorry to hear about your circumstances. You sound like a level-headed, compassionate, and thoughtful daughter, I hope you take care of yourself and realise there's only so much you're able to do.
Research encephalopathy. That's what my MIL has following a fall that caused seizures, which were missed for months. 

There are many reasons for encephalopathy.
Hello, first of all I am so sorry that you are going through this. I had an eerily similar experience this time last year with my grandmother after a fall. It was devastating. I have many years of experience as a social worker with hospice and LTC/dementia care and still, it was unlike anything I have ever had to deal with. My heart goes out to you and your family. I am going to send you a private message and hopefully we can connect.
Has she been checked for a UTI? The fall will have caused damage, and the fall could have been caused by sudden onset delirium due to a UTI. 

It's an easy test, and easy to treat. You won't get her back to normal levels, but it's worth asking about. They get missed very easily, despite their impact.
My heart breaks for you and this situation. Do your best to just keep swimming.
I'm sorry to hear about your mother. Her condition must have been quite a shock.

Her current mental state might be more from the head injury or any complications she might be experiencing rather than whatever was causing her lapses in memory previously. Head injuries can take months to recover from and being in an institutional setting can trigger delirium in some individuals, as can secondary infections such as UTIs, or low blood sugar or blood oxygen levels. 

My mother, who does not have dementia, and my grandmother, who did, both have experienced delirium while in the hospital, for various reasons, but returned to baseline after their condition was treated and after a few weeks at home.

Will they be operating for the subdural hematoma?",2022-03-11 03:04:44,FruitFly,tbl8qp
Dementia,Concerned about Nana and living far away,"TL;DR at bottom

My nana and I fairly close. There is very rarely a day we don’t speak in some form despite the 800 miles between us. She is coming up on being 80 this year and I’m concerned about personality and behavioral changes that are increasing in frequency over time.

She is often forgetting the words to various things. When I try to help and offer solutions she gets flustered and that is turning into anger now. 

Her hoarding behavior has taken on new heights. Before I moved away she was a pack rat who kept various sentimental things and had a storage room that was reasonably filled. According to her now she has two and a half rooms full. Full meaning you literally can’t go in there. This are closed off rooms that don’t impede her ability to move around the house or affect immediate safety. The items hoarded are not immediate health hazards (mostly files and new things). But her unwillingness or inability to throw out a grocery receipt from 1998 is concerning. 

She used to walk a lot. I’m talking many miles a day up until the pandemic. It began with a reasonable concern about her health in going to shops but she eventually stopped taking leisurely walks and has since developed into a refusal to leave her home almost entirely. My mother (who I am NC with) lives with her for the time being and she does her errands for her. 

She has turned to seemingly manipulative tactics for attention. Calling me in tears worried that I’m hospitalized because I didn’t call her for a few days despite the fact that we did text back and forth that morning. Calling me in tears again concerned about my sister having Covid and worried if she’s going to be ok even though my sister never had a severe case and was recovering well and she didn’t tell her she had Covid until after she was on the mend.

She is denying things she has said that I have text and voicemail proof of that I show her and she holds her ground saying to just move on from it and she didn’t say that. 

What in the world can I do to help her? I cannot afford to go see her financially or otherwise. I can’t afford any type of attorney either. I cannot reach out to my mother to help her for my own safety. Most of my other family does not speak to her due to these escalating behaviors. She is refusing to go in for a check up and claiming her mind is as sharp as ever. While she is right in some ways there, in most ways she is not. She isn’t perfect but I love her so much.

TL;DR- what can I do to help my nana from so far away with no money, denial from her and no help from other family?","Can you talk to your mother just this once to sort out the details? One of you or another family member needs to get the paperwork in place that will eventually allow you to make decisions on your grandmother's behalf.  State laws vary, but you can usually find examples online of what you'll need. 

Then call her (not your) dept of aging and ask for their advice. The one in my parents' area is sort of a hodgepodge of different services, but the people there were very helpful in outlining some options. 

Good luck and all the best.",2022-03-10 23:26:45,Qahnaarin_112314,tbhtwi
Dementia,I do crafts every other week with dementia patients. I absolutely love it. Tomorrow is St Patrick’s floral craft to take home. If you have a loved one look into daycare programs they are a lifesaver.,,"As someone who's loved one previously attended a daycare program (and currently lives in a memory care facility), thank you for what you do <3
All that color and creativity that you bring to people’s lives is wonderful!
My grandpa goes to daycare once a week and for valentines day he made a super cute heart card for my grandmother 😭
Trying to get my FIL to send my MIL (she has Alzheimer's).  All they do is sit around watching TV and sleeping all day - it would be good for her to get out once and a while & get some stimulation.  My SIL's mother goes and loves it - she thinks she's going to work, and it keeps her active...
Update from this morning:) they all turned out super cute. Some of the men plan on gifting their flowers to daughters and wives, always adorable. The ladies came out great! I don’t take any photos of the clients where they are identifying just for privacy reasons, if you’re wondering why they are all cropped out.

Can I get some opinions on daycare? My grandmother likes to sleep often, and sitting without her feet up for prolonged periods isn't a good thing, as well as difficulty eating non-blended foods. .. Then there's bathroom issues...  
We've pretty much written it off and are looking into memory care, as we're not sure a daycare would be able to accommodate her. We just hate her leaving us completely as she's not 'that bad' otherwise, and the thought of a nursing home scares her. But we're getting to the point where we just can't provide constant care throughout the day while we're working and visiting aides aren't reliable on actually coming out. They just don't have enough people here.   
We'd love for her to have activity and social time, instead of watching the news and sleeping all day every day.

Dementia,Splish - splash no way I’ll take a bath!,"That sums my day up pretty well. It is now day 12 and she continues to refuse to take a shower. Everyone in the household is being affected by the hygiene issue. I’ve tried shower chairs, music, warm fluffy towels…nope and nope. I’ve tried talking to her about it, if there’s a reason - fear - concern but no. She just doesn’t like to be told what to do - she stated this quite clearly, several times. This is now a regular battle. I have had to rebook medical appointments….I am embarrassed and feel like a failure. It’s actually distressing to myself and my daughter. Then there’s the increase in potential UTI etc…more pills, more dr.’s, more hospital visits. I’ve been going through this cycle with her for months….

I am currently ill and my energy levels are pretty close to bankrupt. I really need some solid suggestions if anyone has any please…","Is a ""bed bath"" an option? Also I would advise not canceling medical appointments. Doctors will be able to give you advise and I PROMISE bad hygiene is nothing new to them! Refusing bathing is so incredibly common in people with dementia and is NOT something you need to feel guilty about.
I work with people with dementia and about half of them have a prescription medication they take before bathing so they can relax a bit.
This is a common issue in dementia. My mom does the exact same thing. I’ll say to my mom every day hey would you like to go shopping.  Ok but you need to get showered up.  That usually does the trick. But I do have those times where I just have to lead her there and start undressing her and she will protest a bit but usually gives in.
Okay, this is going to make me sound awful and it's the first time I've told anyone.  My dad would get to where he *reeked*.  I had to take him to a family party and I  knew everyone would blame me for him being all stinky and I panicked.  I knew he hated being sticky more than anything so I made him a cup of tea and squirted honey all over him by ""accident"".  That got him into the shower.  He didn't care if he stunk because he had lost his sense of smell but being sticky was just too much for him.  Later, I found that making a shower poncho for him out of an old sheet helped as feeling cold and exposed seemed to be big triggers for him.
I fought this for a while but I had to give in. My dad has had one shower in possibly more than 3 years. And that was because I wouldn't stop pestering him but it didn't end well. He also steadfastly refuses to touch soap and he won't wash his hair or brush his teeth. But he's still alive, stinky but alive.
Don’t cancel the appointments, the Dr will be familiar with this issue
My mom goes through stages where this is an issue but luckily not at the moment. The struggle at the moment is with washing her hair. She just refuses and will tell you she washed it last night even though it was washed months ago.  I just gave up on trying. Last week I got to her and she was looking for shampoo to wash her hair! I was so shocked (and happy).. She said someone phoned and told her they are coming to visit (no one phoned) so she must wash her hair for them. Since then I have convinced her one other time to wash her hair because my brother came to visit. So at the moment that is working for us, but not sure for how long...
All the best to you. Hope you find something that works 🙌
I'm a home care attendant for a woman with dementia. I call it wash up Wednesday so she gets a shower once a week. I do her hair for her and put lotion on her feet. I tell her she can have a nice nap after and when she wakes up we can have cookies. I used to have trouble with it but Im just firm and gentle. She usually doesn't fight too much 🤞. Her family can't get her to do it at all though, maybe have someone wear scrubs and pretend to be a nurse? I'm still new with dementia. But usually when I tell her I'm paid to come she listens more. It's strange
We used to be able to get my grandmother to bathe about twice a week. Then it went to once a week. Now we're going on 2 weeks. She will usually say that she already had one, to but usually it's that she'll take one that night. She used to prefer night showers, but these days she's nodding off by 6 and sometimes falls asleep at the dinner table.

We've found that just telling her it's shower time when she's already in the bathroom to go potty works. She may argue, but she's already in there and half undressed. We have a portable heater to help warm up the room. A new shower chair with handles for her to hold on to. She's not even 125 lbs these days, so we sometimes have her go from sitting on the toilet to the shower chair next to it. Then slowly move it to the walk in shower and lift one side at time over the short side. 
I, in quick dry shorts/swim suit, sit on the shower corner bench and help as needed to get her to actually bathe while in the shower. I noticed she mostly just held the showerhead by her head and didn't soap up much. I usually do the shampoo and soap now and let her rinse. We had to remove the shower doors and have a extra long shower curtain on a curved rod for more room inside the shower enclosure. I used to face her towards the controls, but she stayed to play with them or just grab the level to stand up. I tried facing sideways, but she would stick her feet out the shower curtain and water should go out. So now she faces away from the ""front of the shower"" towards me on the bench.

For months now, we've only done showers when that's someone else available to help. At first it was just in case, then it was help to get her safely out of the shower. Now we need help to her getting into the shower as well. The outside person can use the newly purchased towel warmer to warm up the towels and the bathrobe before we need them. The heater can be turned up and faced towards where my grandmother will be once our of the shower. The extra person can get the wheelchair in place and help getting my grandmother dressed quickly so she's not cold as long.

This works for us for the most part. Sometimes she complains the entire time in the shower, but we're stronger than her and able to lift her as needed for now at least.

(Early Monday morning, we have a court date for guardianship, so a much needed shower is planned for tomorrow, Saturday. That's the best we can hope for scheduling for having that needed 2nd person here to assist.)
I’m sorry you’re going through this. I haven’t had to deal with this personally, but I watch a lot of Teepa Snow videos (she teaches classes about care for people with dementia or Alzheimer’s). 

From what I remember, she said to heat up the bathroom real good with a space heater first and get big towels fresh out of the dryer so they’re warm. Have them sit on the shower bench and drape them with the warm towels and then try to take their clothes off under the towels so they’re not exposed to cold air. Keep them covered with the towel as much as possible while you wash them with a soft wash cloth or sponge so they stay warm and don’t feel so “undressed”. For some reason, spraying water can be alarming to some people and it can feel bad on their skin, or they are confused about where it’s coming from and get startled every time. 

If you haven’t watched her videos on YouTube or TikTok (and I think she has DVDs of courses you can buy?), she’s awesome. She uses a “positive approach to care”, and explains how to speak to someone who is scared or combative, clever ways to “trick” them into doing something, and ways to move their body without hurting them if they are resistant.",2022-03-10 18:02:08,Beijamar,tbblgi
Dementia,Feeling gaslit by my mother’s doctors & I’m burning with rage,"Mom was recently diagnosed w MCI & early stage vasc dementia based on a 2021 MRI and a several-hour neurocog psych exam. She was deemed well enough to live independently. But I live with her and know this is not the case. She can’t even use the phone correctly anymore. She can’t dial numbers. She has a follow up appt w her neurologist in 7 weeks but today I called to see if we could expedite things. I reported that she had become violent w me, (she bit me and brought the garage door down on my car) that she had hit a parked car and that I was concerned about her driving. I stated that I do not intend to live w her permanently—I am only here temporarily (because she lied to me and told me she had cancer). The nurse l i t e r a l l y said “**well this is what happens when our parents age; it’s our turn to take care of them**.” (My mother emotionally & physically abused me my entire childhood, so if I were to show her the same level of “care” that she showed me she’d probably kill herself). Sorry I just needed a place to vent. I feel so trapped and I keep trying to reach out to her doctors and am met w indifference. My mother is in denial that she has any problems at all yet still depends upon me heavily yet becomes nasty and combative at the drop of a hat. I fantasize about my mother dying in her sleep. When I wake in the morning and hear her stirring downstairs my heart sinks. I am turning into a monster. I simply cannot take much more of this. (And yes I am in therapy). Thanks for listening and letting me rant.","Find a nursing home or assisted living facility for her.    My mom went thru some of the same stages you mentioned, including telling me to get our of the house and not come back.  When both dad and her became unable to live on their own, we admitted them to an assisted living facility.  This was 2 years ago.  Dad is still there, Mom is in a nursing home nearby, and is wheelchair bound.  She isn't even interested in reading or watching TV.   It is sad, but she will be released from this body soon. 
Good luck, know you are not alone.
Oh F no.. that comment by the nurse filled me with rage. My mom was also emotionally abusive and neglectful to me as a kid. We have a very strained relationship and I refuse to be guilted into taking care of her. For now she is safe with her long time boyfriend but when the time comes she will be going into a nursing home. It is not your job to take care of your parents. I wouldn’t want my son to have the burden of taking care of me when I’m older. 

GRR that makes me mad. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this.
Hey y’all; I’m too exhausted by anger and grief to respond to each of you individually (just came out of a therapy session; thank goodness for my therapist) but I wanted to thank each and every one of you for your advice, support, validation and care. Lots of good stuff here for me to follow through on. And most importantly, I know I’m not alone. And yeah, F that nurse (Carol). Whoever recommended to speak to the nurse manager is spot on. Thank you to you all from the bottom of my heart. 💗
Nope. Get a new neurologist. Your job as an adult kid is to advocate for her wellbeing, but not to be her emotional punching bag especially day-to-day. Frankly, most children are easier than dementia patients. For one thing, they can't drive cars or write checks, and they are easier to physically pick up when necessary. And, they LEARN over time. You need a neurologist to give you serious practical guidance like medications that can help stabilize her mood swings and make her less combative.
Get a social worker involved and let them know you are out. 

You are not alone in this rant. I could have written this myself.  Don’t sacrifice yourself for her. Move forward with your own life and set clear boundaries with social services about what you will and will not take care of. 

Sending you lots of internet hugs
Based on my own experience, I'm going to presume that you do not have an activated Power of Attorney over your mother's healthcare.   When I didn't have one, I couldn't get any cooperation from her primary care doctors.    That indifference pretty much disappeared once I submitted a copy of the POA to their offices.  

As far as next steps, contact your state's Agency on Aging and ask about options for situations like yours.   Specifically ask what needs to happen given that you simply are unable to provide the level of care your mother needs.  You might also find it worth an hour's consultation with an elder law attorney. 

Additionally, I recommend you speak to the doctor's nurse manager.  Relay what the nurse stated to you and advise the manager to train up the nurses so that they recognize that some elderly people were abusive to the same children who are now being pressured to provide elder care.  State that comments like hers are supremely unfair and tone deaf when it comes to adult children struggling to be dutiful to their elderly parents while also needing to protect themselves from additional abuse in the process.   In other words, nurses should just not make those ""judgement statements"" AT ALL.
I’m so sorry you are having to deal with this.  I completely sympathize with you.  While my mom didn’t abuse us kids, she wasn’t nurturing at all and was very critical of us growing up and into adulthood, and the burden of taking charge of her fell on me.  At her onset she was angry and mean and in complete denial.  And was constantly apologizing to us after lashing out.  It was so hard to live with the hurt and resentment of the past while taking care of her.  She finally accepted that she needed to go to assisted living because as fate would have it she developed breast cancer (fortunately it was very treatable) and we told her that she had to go to AL “temporarily” so she could get the care she needed.  She continued to deny anything was wrong with her brain. Initial doc (who missed the signs of breast cancer) never got her on right meds for behavior and she got kicked out of the first place.  New place had memory care and their doc through trial and error got her calmed down. She still occasionally lashed out at staff, but oddly became much nicer to us kids. This made it more bearable considering her past behavior to us. With all the mostly downs (falls, emergency room trips, new physical ailments, incontinence, etc) I was so full of anxiety I couldn’t sleep at night. Passing in her sleep would have been a blessing, but her decline lasted for several more years.  She’s gone now but I do miss the sweet mom that would light up when I’d visit.  I miss the other residents and family members I met and some of the dear CNAs. 

Keep venting, and know that you are doing the best you can given the circumstances, and perhaps find an Alzheimer’s support group. I wish I had known about this sub before my mom passed.  I think you will find it very helpful.
My husband has Lewy Body Dementia and I’ve had to switch neurologists 4 times. They should listen to what you say more than what your mom tells them about her level of functioning. I forget if I’ve mentioned this to you (in my support group, we joke that we all have dementia from just being exhausted) but under HIPAA, you may not be able to get info, but you can give it. Take videos if you have to. 

I already have the paperwork filled out for my husband to go to MC. For example, he needed a Tb test. I hope we don’t reach that point but we toured several facilities to find one that seemed right for him. 

That nurse was so out of line, I think you should report her. My parents both died in their mid to late 80’s with no dementia. It’s not an inevitable thing. Yea they needed care but they weren’t abusive. Ok well my dad was but that is another story. 

You really really really have to take care of yourself. My husband is at a day center now and I’m resting bc we just went on the “visiting family” vacation from hell and I’m exhausted.
Oh my gosh I literally just went through this with my dad’s hospital social worker!!! 
You are so strong and brave and an absolute living angel to have done all you have up to today.

And guess what? If today is the absolute breaking point and you can’t bear this double burden one more second and have to set it down, you’ve already done more than enough.

Don’t ever set yourself on fire to keep another person warm, blood relatives or not. I have to tell myself this every day with my dad (same situation/relationship as yours with your mom).

♥️♥️♥️ out to you, you’re amazing!
F* that nurse. Also, feel free to check out outofthefog.net forum.  So much help and validation there.  They’ll help give you the foundation you need to stand strong against that type of BS
Re driving, call the local police non emergency number and report a dangerous driver. Don’t know where you are but here you can do that anonymously and they will make her take a new test.
Get adult protective services involved.
Don't continue taking care of her! If she qualifies for Medicaid , put her in a nursing home ASAP ! If she doesn't qualify for Medicaid , call Adult Protective Services and tell them she's not in a safe environment because you're fixing to move out. They will tend to her. You are not obligated to care for her and certainly not in a legal sense. If for some reason you have to stay with her in her house for example financial reasons, it doesn't mean you have to be there all day. Especially if the doctors have said she could live alone then you have no legal duty of care even if you live with her. Especially if she's mean and combative, the next time she does that just call the cops. It's what you would do if anyone else was hitting you or biting you right? Once they come and see how things are hopefully they would send her to the hospital or the elderly psych ward and then they will see what's really going on. The main thing is just get somebody else taken care of her so that you don't have to be under that anymore. The very worst thing would be if you snap and did something foolish then she would win because you'd be in trouble. Get the hell out of there :-)
You are not obliged to take care of her. You would be surprised to learn how many old people are left to their own devices by family who are being traumatized all over again when mom or dad gets dementia or otherwise infirm with age.

I received a lot of support from a social worker who works for the health clinic of the PCP and helps people who are trying to place a family member, plan for finances, etc. She is paid by the health plan (Medicare Advantage) and one thing she did, while commending my daughter and me for our sense of moral responsibility, she made it clear that no one could make us or would fault us for setting limits. She at one point advocated doing less, so that failures of independent living due to dementia would prompt the patient to accept help.

Check into the resources available through your mother's health plan.
Yeah my Grandma has dementia and she likes to hit, punch, kick or yell. I can’t put her in a home, but I’m definitely medicating her with Xanax and looking to get other anti psychotics to manage her outbursts. The emotional stress of it all sucks. You don’t have to take care of your mother if you don’t want to, and you shouldn’t have to. Find a facility and hope she goes willingly, or get POA and force her in there.
I’m so sorry you’re going through this. 
I’ve envisioned this happening to me with my mom. 
If I were in your situation, I would be actively trying to find myself a new place and move out of there. If she thinks she doesn’t have any problems, then let her live alone. She can handle it right?
I am in the same space!! My moms not quite there yet but I seethe with resentment when she needs my help. I’ve given up over a year of work to care for her with several leaves over the last few years.

She allowed her husband to sexually and mentally abuse me for years while she stayed drunk and ignored every sign, every other mothers concerns, people trying to
Help. I was to blame for her husbands drunken advances I was a sex pot at 13. 

I put her in assisted living. She’s not thriving and she’s close to my house. I resent having to bring diapers and make sure she’s getting her meds. But since I won’t and can’t and refuse to care for her, it’s better for her safety and it’s safer for my mental health. I resent her so much but nursing care  is safer than being alone. 

It’s time for your mom  if she’s getting aggressive. Do you have a POA in place or medical advocate?

Good luck. YOU ARE NOT A MONSTER. Get a therapist is so helpful . 

Your feelings are your feelings and they’re totally valid. You’re in a safe space to share.
I don’t care if you were raised by the most loving, caring woman on the planet - you are NOT obligated to care for your parents!  Parents are responsible for caring for their children, as they made the decision to have kids on the first place.  You had no say in the matter, so owe them nothing.  For the record, I have kids and have been an imperfect but decent mother (I worked hard to break the cycle of abuse, as they deserved a much better childhood than I had), and I have a close relationship with them.  I do not expect them to take care of me, and I’ve told them this much.  Don’t let that nurse make you feel guilty.  If she cares so much, she can try living with your mother.
That nurse is completely deluded and out of line and you have every right to feel what you are feeling.

I looked at your search history a bit but wasn't able to find a location so I could give you the exact number, but look up your mom's ""Area Agency on Aging"" if you're in the United States.  They are called different things in different states, so let me know if you can't find it.   Area Agencies on Aging are government funded (so free and unbiased) agencies that are central info clearinghouses for elder related stuff. 

Other posters have said to get a social worker involved, that's how you get hooked up with a social worker.    Explain what's going on--that she can't drive, can't use a phone, she's violent, and you aren't able to stay with her because you need to return home to your own job and there are no local family members to take care of her.   

It's up to you if you want to explain the PTSD and why that makes you unable to take care of her.  

AAA will send out a social worker to assess her and figure out if she can stay living on her own if she has caregivers come in, or if she needs to move to a skilled nursing facility. 

Do you or any relatives have power of attorney?

Would your mom sign a HIPAA privacy release at the doctor's office so the doctor can talk directly to you?
Boy, I thought you were my husband for a moment, because your experience is so similar to ours. 

-lies constantly
- can no longer use a phone because of a combination of her hands shaking, and just mentally being unable to navigate it. 
- no violence yet, but honestly, I suspect it's a matter of when, not if. She's gotten to throwing fits whenever she's even slightly upset.
- hitting other cars in parking lots, and being so confused when confronted by people she hit, the people just walked away rather than deal with her. She still refuses to get rid of her car, and insists she still wants to drive. 
- completely in denial
- has started falling down stairs
- something is WRONG with her balance and how she walks. She walks like a drunken sailor. But because she doesn't ""shuffle"", it's not a big deal to them. Her hands also shake badly.  ""Oh, that's what happens when we get old. She just needs PT."" NO, YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER. She's already been through PT, and even the phys therapist said something is WRONG with her. Several of my family members are the same age or older, and NONE of them walk into walls. None of them have these balance and walking issues. It's not a ""Oh, she's just old!"" issue. 

There's a host of other issues that point to her ""not being right"" for a long while that she's been hiding from us and lying about, but the doctors aren't interested if it doesn't fall into an exact profile of what they're expecting to be wrong.

Edit: honestly, I suspect she has Parkinson's disease on top of dementia, because her other symptoms fit. I've already discussed it with my husband that once it hits the point we're no longer able to care for her, we need to place her in a memory care unit. I will not give up 5-20 years of my life to care for her -I do not have the physical health to do so. While I believe in caring for our elders, people forget that the elderly with these diseases didn't use to live, lingering so long. They used to pass away much quicker, so when symptoms started, they'd naturally pass away 2-5 years later when combined with other comorbidities. Now our medical care is great at keeping bodies going, even when the mind is done and gone, and this stresses out families that are already stretched thin still taking care of the younger generation.
Take the keys away or disable her car so she can’t use it.  Better to do it now before she has an accident and kills or maims someone.  You don’t have to tell her you did it, just ‘lose’ the keys and/or the battery or distributor cap.",2022-03-10 14:34:54,SuchMatter1884,tb6tjn
Dementia,Duty of protection a quick thing to obtain?,"Mum got to the point where we need to consider a full time carer or a home. Did ask my dad to sort power of attorney but never did and now he not accepting the fact and letting lack of hygienic and eating go.

Any advice on this or how you went about care when not all family's agree would be much appreciated","In America we have a POA, Power of attorney documentation. It's a but pricey and took about 30 days, lawyers involved. I'd consider you ask for home Healthcare to help her since your father is still around instead of a home. These services will help your mom, from bathing, cooking and cleaning her home for her.
Where I live it's called an order of protection, and you need to get a licensed social worker involved. Where I live it isn't quick at all, and most people hire social workers out of pocket to expedite it. 

It wouldn't matter if some family disagree if the social worker determines she is no longer capable of taking care of herself.

Other than upping maid services what can long distance family members do? Are there devices or aids that help?,"From all of the things that happen with dementia, it's kind of silly for the home to be complaining about this imo.  Bathroom accidents and dementia kind of go hand in hand.
[deleted]
We pay almost $7,000 per month for assisted living. They can clean it. Sorry not sorry
My dad had dementia 
We had to go in the bathroom with him to make sure he sat down. He also wore adult diapers
Look up “condom catheters”. There are some good new designs of these and I have heard good things about them from a caregiver
My dad was having urgency to go and also was afraid of falling if trying to rush to the bathroom. He did well with a male urinal (angled plastic bottle type thing) that cost less than 20$ at the drugstore. The MC staff would then just empty it if he didn't. Also, check if he has an enlarged prostate as this can cause near continuous feeling of needing to go. Same for a UTI or being dehydrated oddly enough... Mostly just better management by the facility is what's needed :( He could also be asked to wear ""special"" men's ""underwear"". Never call them diapers...
I would tell the place this is a normal occurrence with most elderly people, from men to women etc. They get paid greatly for our seniors who live there, this should not be a complaint from the facility at all, all in all the fees charged for these homes include housekeeping services.

Dementia,So now she's getting committed. I am at a loss,"My mother is being sent to a mental institution. She's been assessed as a danger to herself and others.  She started the day by trying to punch and kick my stepfather.  She picked up the phone and dialed 911.  She had them send her an ambulance. She demanded they ""take her to a nursing home."" My stepfather had them send her to an excellent nearby hospital.  She, as I mentioned above, was assessed. They are putting her in a mental facility and they say she will never go home again. She'll be sent to a nursing home with capacity for mental illness.

For context, she has dementia, and about a year and a half ago she fell and cracked her right ocular socket, bashed the back of her head and got a massive hematoma and concussion.  She then, a few months later, fell down the main staircase in their house. She hit her head and also broke her ankle. She had a massive stroke. A few weeks later she fell down another flight of stairs and hit her head.  On top of her dementia she also has brain damage, memory loss and a a memory span of about 2 minutes.

Recently she's become more aggressive and paranoid. Culminating in today where she's threatened to kill herself and my stepdad.

I just needed to share this with folks who can understand.","And lots of prayers, too, God love you.  That is a lot to go through, how scary for her, you and the rest of the family!

Dementia,funk you Dementia,"Im 40 and ive been crying for the last 7 months.  My wife and I suspected my mother was developing dementia about 6 years ago when she started ""hearing music"".  Then she dealt with thyriod cancer and radiation pills for the last 2 years and the dementia ramped up.  My dad started answering the phone as my mom became more confused and often asked for her mom (died 50 years ago).  The last 2 months she hit late stage HARD.  Angry.  Thousand mile stare.  Constant desire to go home and find her mom.  Sleeping most of the day. Not recognizing my dad who has been her caregiver through it all.  Falls, weakness.  2 weeks ago she stopped eating.  This past weekend she collapsed and my dad had to take her to the ER.  They admitted her, treated for a fall and UTI.  She was afraid and scared, confused, couldnt swallow, wouldnt eat.  She was mostly unintelligible but puckered up to get a kiss from my dad before we left. The hospital talked around what was really going on even though we knew. Then they brought in palliative care to dicuss hospice.  We made the decision based on her end of life health orders to move her to hospice.  She will pass soon, morphine assisted sleep, seemingly peacefully.  I read some james patterson to her.  Mu dad played her some music.  We left for today. This condition stole my amazing mom.  Funk you dementia.

Edit: i have a standing weekly appointment for phone counseling. My dad is in a caregiver support group.  I have an incredible wife and 3 amazing young boys.  We are as supported as can be thankfully.  Just venting with people who understand.  Thank you.","Please accept my sincere condelences

We took care of our dad 2 1/2 years 24/7.  He died on hospice at home, surrounded by kids, grandkids and great grands

Agree, fuck dementia!!!!

I miss you like the sun misses flowers in the depths of winter, instead of beauty to direct it’s light to, the heart hardens like the frozen world your absence has banished me to. 

OP, I hope peace comes to your heart soon. Horrible disease where we lose them one tiny piece at a time.
So sorry. Nothing about this is easy! I'm glad to hear you are doing your best to take care of yourself.
All my sympathies for you and your loved ones dealing with this horrible disease also with you in saying Fuck dementia.
I'm sorry you and your family are going through this. To quote Winnie the Pooh,  ""How lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.""
Very sorry for your loss. It’s a good idea you put her in a hospice facility instead of trying to DIY at home. You can be her family instead of her enemy.

My grandmother passed from the end stage dementia yesterday morning. i know she is at peace. Your mom will be soon.
I'm so sorry! You and I are about the same age and my mom has had dementia for about 3 years. It changes everything.

I know how difficult this is for you and I'm sorry about your mom. You can take comfort in knowing her suffering is almost over. Prayers for your dad and you and your family.
Sorry to hear that. Dementia sucks. Remember that your mom will always be the woman in your happy memories, photos and videos.
Such a wretched illness.
Dementia can, indeed, go funk itself. My mother is being committed because of it. I'm so sorry your family is going through this right now.  Fuck dementia.
After listening to EATEOT , or hearing about people's experiences with the illness , now l'm ,,scared"" shitless about the illness . I hope to god (if he exists) than l don't get this illness , l'd rather get Cancer or Covid than that illness .
I couldn’t have said it better myself. Dementia is a vicious monster that slowly steals away people we love. I’m in the thick of it with my father and suspect that fucking monster is beginning its wicked work on my mom. 

The absolute twisted reality for me is that dad has just basic dementia, so while I have a front row seat to watch his cognition decline, even in his most confused moments, he knows who he is and who I am and maintains the kind, gentle nature he has had as long as I’ve known him. I should be (and am) grateful for that mercy… but in my darker moments, I question what kind of unspeakable asshole dementia is that the horror I’m living through is, relatively, getting off easy.

I know dementia is a force of the universe and just is… but if it were a conscious being… I’d gladly spend several lifetimes in penance for 15 minutes alone with them. Fuck you, dementia!",2022-03-09 18:30:32,cujoe645,takpww
Dementia,Power of Attorney Pre Diagnosis,"I hope this post makes sense and hasn't been covered already. I tried looking through but could not see an answer. Sorry if it's a bit all over and will try to keep short.

I'm 29, my dad is 67 and my mam 57. They live together. Around five years ago my mam first phoned and said I may notice a difference in my dad, he's forgetting things more. As I didn't visit home often, I didn't really notice much. It wasn't until COVID that I really noticed, and the last six months, have got particularly worse. A few years ago, he had memory tests and passed, but he's had more recently and did not do well. It's to the point now where every conversation we are repeating. Taking a list to the shop for two items is pointless because he forgets he has a list, doesn't brush teeth, struggles with movies now etc.

However, this is not the only thing we've noticed. My dad gets extremely down and has very sudden mood swings, he's restless to point that he's taken two months to do some invoices that should have taken days. He can be quite insensitive when talking to people - rude, almost cruel, sometimes pretty vulgar, and not realising it. He can be so angry, and his mood changes so quick and he gets down. He struggles in group situations and will become withdrawn because he can't keep up with conversation, and when replying his response doesn't make sense or relate to the topic. It's the personality change that has been really difficult to see - he is so angry, down, fed up, withdrawn. He constantly wants to go out somewhere with my mam (who is often tired from work) and gets really upset/angry when she wants to go out with a friend as he feels he is being left alone. I'm trying to come home more to help, I work from home, but he often wants to go out somewhere and it's hard to say no.

He has had memory tests, CT scan and is having an MRI scan on Sunday. After looking at the types of dementia, we thought all the personality changes could mean it is a form of frontotemporal dementia - but of course this could be totally wrong, he just has all symptoms listed.

It's been five years since they first went to the doctor. The awful thing is my dad still believes he is just getting old and this is standard forgetfulness, but as I said, we can barely have a ""normal"" conversation now. We still have not had a diagnosis, but something is definitely not right, whatever the outcome is after MRI. 

We were at my dad's brothers funeral today (72, Parkinson's). It is the first time we have mentioned it to my Aunty as we are not close and she told us you are much better trying to sort power of attorney before the diagnosis. My friends mam also said this, as she had to with her own mother. We were planning to talk to my dad about this after more results come through but now we think it is best we talk to him as soon as possible. To be honest, we are both concerned about whether he will get much worse before we get the diagnosis and then it will become much more difficult.

Does anyone have any advice with the situation? The big concern is waiting for a diagnosis and by that time he could be much worse, but he is a very proud person and it's going to be an extremely difficult conversation.

Thanks for reading and sorry if I went on abit, or this has been answered.

Edit: UK based and sorry for ignorance on this matter!

Edit 2: Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to reply to my post, and the detailed responses. It means a lot. 

I'm frustrated at myself because I've read over the gov web pages/AgeUK/Alzheimer's websites so many times. My mam's reading comprehension isn't the best, so I've read them to her and explained what I've read. She has been working in a care home for the last 18 months and we've done all her at home tests together, including one on POA, so I don't know why we didn't think we could get it started beforehand.

I've always called my parents my best friends, and my dad will always be the person who could make me, and my mam, laugh until we cried and our sides were in agony. I'm staying home 2/3 weeks at a time at the moment, because my mam is still working and for some reason, my dad is a lot more understanding and mellow with me than anyone else. We're going to talk after having breakfast today.

I know that's unnecessary info, I guess it just feels good to put it off my chest to complete strangers.

Thank you so much. Don't really post on Reddit but so glad I did.

Edit 3: Spoke to him this morning with my mam and he was very honest about things and seems to have come to terms with the fact that everything isn't normal and he is getting worse. He's very happy for my mam to have POA and me to be replacement should anything happen to her. Started the application form, just need to print it out and he has asked our neighbour to be certificate provider. Thanks everyone. Such a big relief and so happy to be moving forward.","You need a POA before diagnosis.
Get the POA as soon as possible. We tried to get it for my Dad but he was considered too far gone to be capable to sign it. So we have to go the guardianship/deputyship route. It is expensive and we still have not had a court date. In the meantime my Dad refuses to deal with bills etc. and so we get people issuing legal demands for non-payment (which we cannot do anything about), we cannot get the info to do his tax return for him, the house needs repairs which we cannot authorise, his rental properties need gas inspections etc. Also UK based
Get the POA now. Have it drawn up by an attorney and make sure it includes everything including who the health care surrogate is. It’s much better to have it done before the diagnosis. Know this, you will have to file a copy with any bank he has an account with, his insurance companies, doctors and always have the designated POA carry a copy on them for emergencies. I got one for my Mom after she had a catastrophic accident but before the dementia diagnosis. All the behaviors your describing are a part of the progression of dementia. Once they make the diagnosis get a neurologist on board and they will prescribe medicines that will help.
My dad is like yours in that he is proud stubborn but also paranoid and suspicious. I still don't have POA and he might be too far gone for me to get it. At least in the US, they have to appear competent enough to the notary when they sign. So if you can get it soon it's better. My dad has frontotemporal and he craves sugar, way beyond the normal level. But what I've noticed is the more sugar he eats the better off his brain is. So if he eats two or three desserts he actually seems quite sane even though his speech is still somewhat impaired. So I try to make sure he has enough sugar before we have to do anything that requires a brain. Not sure if that will work for you.
You can get power of attorney at any time in the UK as long as the person has mental capacity to consent to it, so do it straight away. You can do it all online, it's not complicated but there's quite a long delay with them processing at the moment .

Bear in mind he has to consent to it. You also have to have a 'certificate provider' who confirms that he is mentally capable to consent.

I got it for my dad before his dementia got serious and it is absolutely vital.

https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney
My husband was on the cusp of being diagnosed.  I explained to the attorney what was going on.  We both went to the attorney to get our will done as well as POA and health directives.  The attorney spent enough time with us that he was comfortable my husband understood all that was going on and so we were able to get everything we needed done.  So, just don't wait.
Do it ASAP! 

My mom had a tentative dementia diagnosis, but was still very clear-minded about her intentions when it came to finances, her estate, and how she wanted things handled. We moved her close to my brother, which required moving to a different state in the United States, and we use that as an opportunity to go to an estate planning lawyer and have her estate updated. 

After the meeting, when she clearly told her estate planning lawyer that she wanted to set up a trust and power of attorney, her lawyer quit the firm and a new one was assigned to handle her file. The new lawyer called my mom a couple times and got very confused versions of my mother, so the lawyer then emailed my brother and I to express doubt about her competency. I work with lawyers so I was able to clearly articulate that she has the capacity (which is a critical word in the United States) to understand and express her estate planning wishes. The lawyer met with my mother twice, and she clearly articulated her wishes, and we were able to get the trust finalized and the POA setup. It was a huge relief.

In my mom's case, it helped that the distribution of her trust mirrored her prior will, so no one could accuse us of exerting undue influence over her to convince her to change her estate plans.
Before the diagnosis!! You can get a legal POA form at most office supply stores or maybe online ( I got the one for my dad as our local Office Depot). If you're in the UK I'm not sure what stores you have like that there. In any case the notary will have to go over the forms with him or her to determine if they understand what they're signing. Depending on the notary, they may be very detailed or not. I found with my father he understood things better in the mornings. It's also important to have two witnesses to the loved ones signing in addition to the notary. A lot of places only require one, but if you are in a place that requires two and you only have one then they can give you a lot of problems. What I found is that the part that makes it legal is that the notary and the witnesses actually see the loved one make their signature. Even if it's not super legible LOL.

What helped me get my father to agree was by telling him it's better for a family member to carry out their wishes through a POA than to have the government (or a court, judge, etc) appoint a guardian. 

Let them know that the guardianship process is a matter of public record and the guardian does not always end up being a relative!  The appointed guardian will make all decisions for them AND the guardian does not have to abide by the person's wishes when making those decisions! An additional fact that might help your loved one decide to do the POA is that to go through the guardianship process the loved one has to be legally declared incompetent. Most people even with dementia do not want to be known as incompetent. Hopefully this will make the conversation easier.

Another way to do it is to engage either your family lawyer or doctor to talk with your loved one about the power of attorney. Sometimes having someone in an authority position tell them that it's the best thing to do works better. Especially if the loved one is suspicious of the relatives motives or just paranoid in general lol. For my father the idea of having strangers making decisions for him was enough to have him agree to do the POA paperwork with no problems. Also, the POA is supposed to carry out the person's wishes on their behalf, they are technically not allowed to override the person when they make decisions for themselves. However, I have found the POA to be a much better way to go. 

To be very clear about how it worked for me, I took the forms to my dad and told him we were going to read through it together and if there was anything he didn't understand he should stop me and we would discuss it. 

At every place it needed his initials or signature, I would say did you understand what we just talked about? And he would say yes or no. If it was no we would go over it again and I would emphasize that I really wanted him to understand so he would feel comfortable with signing. If the answer was yes, I would say okay then sign here. 

It took several hours but we went very slowly and patiently and calmly and discuss things very straightforwardly and practically. My dad is very analytical and this made him feel comfortable. Couple of times I could tell he was kind of antsy about the process so we would take a minute and get a glass of water and sometimes I would kind of joke with him like this is so time-consuming right. 

I stressed to him it was important to take our time and be careful. Once we did all that I told him that in the morning we would see a notary and she would watch him sign the final page but that she would also want to go over everything to make sure he understood what he had already signed. It definitely made it easier I hope things like this could make it easier for you as well. Good luck.
I don't understand why you would need POA if your mother is doing well.
I was able to get a POA for my mom without trouble after diagnosis. She could only sign her first initial, and that only with help.",2022-03-09 11:32:04,yellowhulahoop,tabmtt
Dementia,"Dad is sundowning, should I tell him?","My father was very mean to his caregiver last night. It was completely out of character for him, should I tell him today while he is in a different state?","Since sundowning cannot be controlled by the person going through it, what is your expected result of telling him?
All it will do is temporarily make him feel like shit and then he'll forget and do it again.
I personally think this is more of a caregiver conversation VS with your dad. Hopefully the caregiver is trained and understands the disease and doesn’t take things like this personally. 

You could always discuss it with your dad but this is most likely going to continue as it’s out of his control. Plus as he progresses he will soon forget the conversations. 

My grandma sundowns HARD and can become pretty cruel and moody. If we aren’t there to immediately react to it, we let it slide unfortunately. My grandma doesn’t remember what she did an hour ago so having a civil convo sounds great in theory but won’t help. 

My mom and aunt (her primary caretakers) gave the caretakers specific instructions as to timing to help everyone avoid the worse of the disease when possible. For example, they know she sundowns around 8-9 so they told them to just try to get have her in her room ready for bed by then. Another example is that my grandma has depression and likes to sleep in until 10 so the caregivers aren’t to bother my grandma till 11.
What do you hope would be gained from that?


The answer is no, it just will make him feel bad, he can't help it.

Also, if he starts looking for dead relatives, honesty is NOT the best policy. It just starts them grieving again and again. Tell them they are out shopping, etc, and they will be back. He will forget he asked soon enough
I tell my mom when she is sundowning or has hallucinated but i say it in a very compassionate manner in a way that is comforting. i'm not like, 'you are just crazy, stop' but i'm like, 'mom, you arent behaving very nicely, but its not your fault. its the end of the day and you are tired, you have dementia (she knows she has dementia, she remembers this much, but gets confused), so you get confused sometimes. everything is ok and everyone loves you, i'm here and everything is going to be okay' and then i tell her whatever was incorrect was incorrect and then try to change the subject immediately to something that is real, because my mom will build false memories if i dont correct her
No. just modify the situation so that sundowning is less likely from now on. Give him dinner and melatonin (Seroquel also helps a lot) in the early afternoon, calming music and herbal tea, then try to have him in bed by 8 or so. In the morning give them a SAD lamp if they struggle to get out of bed. then they will wake up earlier and get sleepy earlier.
My husband has dementia and there are times when he just erupts in anger and starts yelling at me.  I know it is part of the disease but I push right back and tell him to knock it off.  Also times when he is just so out of it he barely knows where he is.  The following day I will talk to him about it and what he was feeling and if he was aware of how out of it he was.  I don't have much of a filter when it comes to his behavior. I think he has a right to know what is happening to him even if he doesn't always retain that information.  Plus, I am curious what he can remember.  He will feel badly when he has treated me badly but it doesn't last long.  So, you know your father, would he want to know?
Your dad can’t correct his behavior because he has a brain disease. I second the commenter who suggested talking to the caregivers. My mom has picked a caregiver to say rude shit to, but she also loves that caregiver. I check in with that caregiver regularly to make sure things are ok, and she lets me know when my mom says rude stuff. It’s not going to get better. The only thing we can do is make sure we are communicating as care partners.
I tell my dad “you may not recall this but you told Ms. Z … and that was not appropriate. Please be careful of your workers feelings.” Sometimes helped for a little bit.
I reckon its good exercise.",2022-03-09 08:24:19,athermalwill,ta7peh
Dementia,"For the most part it really sucks, but my mom telling me how great I look is weirdly wonderful","My mom, who has Lewy Body dementia, was always very weight-conscious, often telling me or my brother how we need to lose weight (even if we were exercising and generally healthy and happy, just not skinny). It was frequently a point of conflict for us. So when I moved home to help take care of her, I prepped myself emotionally for the comments she would undoubtedly make, because a) I was already ""curvy"" and then gained a lot of pandemic weight and b) dementia means you lose every filter.

But the completely unexpected thing is that now, she is always telling me how good I look. How pretty I am. What an attractive woman I am. Not *once* has she commented on my weight. I like to dye my hair bright colors like blue or red, and she frequently comments on how much she loves that, so she still does pay attention to appearances - she just doesn't give a damn about how much I weigh. (Also, oddly, she will always notice if I do something different to my hair, even if it's subtle - even if she isn't quite sure who I am, she knows my hair isn't like it was yesterday. Dementia is weird and wild.)

And it's like a small gift that this disease has brought me. To know that what matters to her about me *is not my weight*.

I'd give it up in a heartbeat to have my mom back with all her capability and memory, of course. But having her say those things... I didn't realize how much I wanted to hear that from her, and it means so much to hear it now.

I don't even know why I'm posting this, but it overwhelms me a little and I guess I just wanted to share.

&#x200B;

*editing to add: My mom generally was always very encouraging toward me and told me often how she admired my intellect or my emotional intelligence, so she has mostly been a very positive presence in my life. But the weight thing, that really was the one big problem, and I think like most people I tend to remember the negative thing someone said over the positive things they also said.*","Awe. I’m so glad you got to see that side of her. What a precious gift. Consider writing this down in a journal so you’ve got that special memory saved.
My mom did the same thing!  Pre-dementia and in the early stages, she often asked me how much I weighed.  I always said “more than you…” with a smile.  Later, not a word about my weight but super complimentary about my clothes, and how pretty I was.  Those were definitely the good days!",2022-03-09 00:39:53,FeuerroteZora,ta0sm2
Dementia,My dad the anomaly.,"As I sit here hammered, reminiscing my dad who truly was and still is my hero, he is unfortunately knocking on heavens door. He’s at the point of no return but still a happy charismatic man. His interest and appetite for food is out the window. We know what will happen next and it sucks. 

He has had dementia for 22 years and I’m in awe but very happy that he’s lasted this long. Cheers to you Jhonny M. We love you!

r/dementia thank you not only for just me but for everyone, such a good community. Keep on keeping on! ✌️","Very sorry for your impending loss. Glad he is happy and charismatic still. 22 years that is amazing!!!

My grandmother died overnight in the early hours of Tuesday. today.
I'm so sorry for originally misunderstanding what you posted. It's clear you have taken very good care of him and how much you LOVE him. I'm praying for your comfort and peace.
It sucks. 

Towards the end, my dad put his arms out and hugged me. He hugged my sister and my mum too. Wasn't strong enough to swallow, but he bloody hugged us. 

I know he knocked on heaven's gates, then strolled right through & took his rightful place. 

Keep those good memories of your dad front and centre, for sure he was so loved, and loved you too. 

Adding my thanks to this sub. Even though it may not feel like it some days, you're all heroes.
Your positivity adjust the difficult time is inspiring, I hope you abs your father are able to get a reprieve (albeit in different ways) peacefully.
I'm glad i get to walk my dad across the finish line.  The upside is I may miss him when he's gone,  but the amount of work he's become will balance it out ... so i won't miss him THAT much.
I’m hammered too haha. What you said really hit home. I’m barely into year 2 of my dad’s dementia and suspect, from his physical health, it’s going to be a long road to the end. 

My dad is also a happy, charismatic man… which makes his occasional wandering quite interesting, because neighbors and others who encounter him don’t suspect he has dementia and will take him to the places he asks to go (usually for smokes). 

This is my first night in r/dementia. Not sure why it took me so long to join, but it looks like it’s going to be a good place for me to be. I wish you luck and peace as things progress.
How wonderful you have such good memories of your Father. What a great legacy he leaves for you and your family.  Peace and love to all of you.

Dementia,Mom isn't coming home.,"About 4 years ago, I was going through a divorce and in need of a place to stay.  So I crashed in my mom's spare bedroom, intending to only stay a few months while I figured things out.  But, about three months after I moved in, she was diagnosed with dementia.  So my siblings and I discussed things with her, and being that it was early stages, she pretty much understand everything we were saying.  It was decided that I would just continue to live with her to ensure that she was safe.  Plus I became her chauffer as the doctor forbid her to drive anymore.  And the slow decline began.  It really wasn't too bad.  Especially compared to what others have gone through.  She never got aggressive or violent.  She got frustrated at times, like when she looked at picture of someone and couldn't figure out who it was, but she knew that person was important to her, because otherwise why would she have a picture of them.  And she would get depressed when I would tell her who it was.  It was heartbreaking to see her not recognize her father or her sister or her grandchildren.   But, overall, things weren't bad.  She never wondered off or anything like that.  Then 2022 happened.  

She tested positive for covid on the Jan 7.  She recovered from covid, but never got her strength back.  On Feb 4th, she went to the ER. She was diagnosed with a severe UTI and Spesis.  She was admitted to the hospital.  On the 2nd night her oxygen dropped to 48% and she was rushed to the ICU where she spent 2 days.  After that she was moved back to a regular room and spent a total of 10 days in the hospital. She was then sent to a rehab center.  

She has not made any progress and today the rehab center informed us that they will discharge her  on the 18th.  But, she needs 24/7 care now.  So, she will have to go to a nursing home.  And I guess she will just spend the rest of her life in a bed.  

Frankly, I've reached a point that I never thought I would.  If she's not going to get any better, then I'm hoping the rest of her life isn't going to be very long.  My prayers are now asking God to take her.  Let her go to heaven and be with my Dad and with her parents again.  

Dementia sucks.","Dementia sucks

We were able to take care of our dad, the five of us, in his home for 2 1/2 years round the clock. He died on hospice at home, in June. We loved him and will miss him, but it was also very sad, he wasn't our dad anymore. 

S/N 2 days after our dad died, I went to the house to take care of the dog, but he was dead also. We say our dad got to heaven and our mother asked about the dog so he came back to get him

Dementia sucks
I'm so sorry you're going through all that. To realize she's not coming home has to be incredibly difficult. 

I just got home after many months of caring for my mom while transitioning her to assisted living and the resulting grief of that has been enormous. 

So, after your 4 years...that's rough. I feel for you. Few  understand the grief caregivers go through.

Dementia does suck. It's such a cruel disease. Peace to you and your mom. 💜
Yes it does. As someone in a similar position I don’t know what else to say but that life can be very hard. And it just feels like we just keep marching forward with no respite in sight. I wish I had an easy answer.
I am now in a very similar situation to yours. My Dad has been suffering from dementia for a couple years now with me alone as his primary caregiver. I'd recently brought in some outside professional caregivers for assistance. He also has COPD but that showed no signs of worsening until just recently when his SpO2 dropped significantly and he had an urgent need for supplemental oxygen.

Since that event he has declined dramatically for whatever reason. That event seemed to really tip things over the edge for him (perhaps because of becoming less active and more sedentary but also the emotional/mental stress of recognizing that he needs this medical help now). He is mostly bed-bound now and I don't see him improving much. Further, the medications required to stave off agitation seem to knock him out as well. Still, things are probably as good as they can be for him -- he is still in his own home and able to have moments of joy (at least until the sundowning hits).

You are correct that dementia is an awful, unrelenting disease that is incredibly cruel both to the sufferer and to those around them.
I'm so sorry, OP
Love you.
I'm sorry for your mom and you. Definitely the ICU messed her up, been in bed for so many days zaps your physical strength (been there) and at her age and situation is going to be hard for her to come back from that.

Sad to say, but is better for her to go off. My grandmother  suffered a fall last september (she is 94) and the fracture/hospital stay destroyed her strength and since she had been slowly declining mentally the last few years I basically went to say good buy a few months ago, she still holding  on barely and I want to see her one last time before she goes.  

So cherish the moments you had with her and be prepared to let her go because that's the hard part.
May you find the peace you deserve, God speed mom.
You probably already looked into this so please disregard if so. I'm so sorry for your pain. Would she qualify for hospice? She could come home and caregivers would come in to take care of her. It's covered by most insurance and also Medicare. My mom was on hospice in the nursing home but only for a week before she passed. If I had to do over again she would have been in my home for sure. That's why I move my dad in with me because I don't want to go through that again. The care they gave her there was good but not being with her when she died was horrible. Just a thought.

Don’t feel bad about “lying” if it helps to calm your patient. My siblings and I did this a lot with my mom to help prevent agitation.
The book *The 36 Hour Day* is a treasure trove of information.
Lie. It’s the only thing that will bring them comfort and in turn make your job easier. It’s a win win.
You can use some vague or ambiguous words that aren’t technically lying if it can avoid distress and makes you feel better. 

Instead of “no” it helps to focus their attention on some kind of plans for some point in the future, realistic or not.

Dementia,Mother wants to go to bed all day,"Hello,
My mother have middle stage dementia and for a long time likes to go to bed very early, sometimes 17 or 18 hours. The worst problem is that she stays in bed until 10 AM and only exits it to go to the living room to eat and drink when I tell her, and when I exit the living room and let the TV turned on, after a couple minutes she wants to stay in bed again, so I have to keep ""fighting"" through all the day to make she stay out of her bed until it's the right time to sleep. I put a new TV in her bedroom and I think it maybe can help she stay awake more time, and I'm planning to hire a in home caregiver to help me, but I don't know how to orient the caregiver if my mother tell she wants to go to bed. I'm supossing staying in bed or trying to sleep for so many hour isn't healthy for her, and I want to make she sleep fine through the night. I also have a care camera to see how she is sleeping at night, and most nights she seens to be sleeping fine.

Can anyone give me some tips on this problem?","My partner's most dramatic shift that led to dementia diagnosis (finally!) was that she took to bed in August 2020, has stayed there ever since,  and has to be pried out with a crowbar. If you hear any solutions let me know.

Biggest problem has been loss of muscle tone. She had a very mild case of Covid earlier this year (we're both triple vaxxed and mask-obsessive, and I was apparently asymptomatic). She lost the ability for about a week to walk, toilet, or even roll over in bed. Likely wouldn't have been an issue if she had any muscle tone in reserve. At one point, had to call police to pick her up off bathroom floor at midnight. She fell, and I couldn't bench press 160 lb of inert mass to even hoist her to a position she could leverage herself upright

Best solution I've found so far is routine: regular, predictable schedule of times she *must* get up and do something. Towel folding busy-work, meals, a scheduled walk outside…

Safety and low stimulation seem to be her main concerns. The bed is safe and warm. The rest of the world is rapidly becoming strange, unfamiliar, hard to navigate, anxiety provoking—thus threatening. Has your mom been evaluated for depression? UTI? Meds evaluated for too much CNS depressant activity (calming meds can do that)? Blood pressure and blood oxygen levels okay? 

Maybe introducing another caregiver would be a good time to introduce a mandatory set of short ""out of bed"" intervals, because ""doctor's orders.""
Get her blood iron levels checked. I speak from experience.
All you can really do is try to redirect her. What works with my dad is offering to watch one of his fave movies with him or offering him his tablet to play on as he loves playing solitaire and casino slots lol. Try to find something to distract her for even an hour. Just realize it's not going to always work and in the end she will have good days where she is more compliant and bad days where she isn't. The home care giver can also help with this.
Hmm, yes get an in-home caregiver!  A properly trained care-giver will be accustomed to this sort of issue, & have many tactics to try get around it.    Find a nearby nice cafe they can go out to for a treat, or put outdoor seating furniture if you have outdoor space & if your weather is ok for that.  Or find some local program for day-respite for your mother, or a community centre they can visit.  Our area has a few dementia-specific respite outings, they come pick them up 9:30 - 10:30am in a mini-bus, go to a community centre for (dementia-appropriate) activities & a simple lunch / snacks, & drop them back home around 2 - 3pm, fees covered by home-care services.  

Or, find some activities your mum CAN do, and likes doing.  Put them on a table in loungeroom / diningroom / where-ever.   Start some of the activities WITH her - idk eg mindful colouring book, word-search (crossword puzzles get too difficult of course) , seated-quoits, whatever.  Get a big plastic jar full of mixed old buttons & beads (thrift-store) that she has to sort into different containers.  Sort by size, or by colour, or by whatever. Or a basket of handkerchiefs and handtowels and teatowels to sort through & fold up & put in another basket.  Then you can call her & ask ""how's the <insert activity > going mum?  Did you do some of it, thanks for helping, isn't it fun!  

Often I think, they may as well stay in bed because they can't think of anything else and don't have anything else to do.  Find her some things to do & lay them out started already, not packed away so she can't even see them & can't work out what to even do to start.  

good luck!",2022-03-08 11:17:21,somebodyelse33,t9kdpu
Dementia,Friend gave me this book saying Dementia is cure-able?,"A friend of mine ordered me a book on Amazon titled: Dementia Myth: Most Patients With Dementia Are Curable by a Dr. Vernon Coleman. I haven’t opened it yet because I’m not quite sure how to handle it at the moment. Part of me is curious and part of me is furious.

Before I take a look, has anyone else come across this book? It says he’s a UK doctor. Is there any merit to what he says?","Your friend meant well but books like that aren’t helpful are they? It’s not like there’s some secret cure for dementia hidden from all the doctors.  

I wish there was a cure. Dementia sucks.  But false hope being peddled for money is not nice.

If you get the book, please share some of what it contains.  I’m curious.

One of my brother’s friends is a pharmaceutical rep and he called me up saying our mom needs a LOT of turmeric and to take the dementia medication and implied it would stop the disease in its tracks.  No, it doesn’t.  And turmeric in high doses like that damages the liver.  

People mean well but sheesh, sometimes it’s draining.
The author’s wiki page is fascinating. Not good or aspirational, but fascinating: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Coleman. What a nut job and all around horrible person.
[deleted]
The author's Wikipedia entry alone should be enough to tell your friend to stick it up his arse 

""Vernon Coleman is an English conspiracy theorist,\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] anti-vaccination activist,\[4\]\[5\] AIDS denialist,\[6\]\[7\] blogger and novelist who writes on topics related to human health, politics and animal issues.  
  
Coleman's medical claims have been widely discredited and described as pseudoscientific. He was formerly a newspaper columnist and general practitioner (GP).""
I used to really like him... but he turned out to be a complete twat. I understand he is banned from several TV stations for demonstrating threatening behaviour. Says it all really...
Proceed with caution, I believe he also thinks AIDS and covid are hoaxes. I’d bin the book and stay away from future medical diagnosis discussion with this friend.  I’m sure they mean well, but this isn’t the way.
Nope. It is not curable. I study this for a living and care for my parents, who both live with dementia. Symptoms may be somewhat manageable with medications, but this is a terminal disease. People die from complications of dementia. I’m sorry your friend gave you a book with misinformation.
I don't know about the book, but what i know about the man is reason enough not to trust the book.   Coleman denies that AIDS exists.  He's COVID conspiracy nut.  He said that autism isn't real, children are just brats and should be thrown into a vat of raw sewage to teach them some manners. 

Speaking as the parent of a child with autism and also as the child of a parent with dementia -  I have zero interest in what this asshole has to say
There are ways to prevent and slow. No cure. Prevention - very high quality high dose fish oil, social activity, healthy weight , routine cardio and weight lifting, good sleep hygiene , learn new skills
No merit at all. Not backed by science.
That doc who wrote that is a POS
The only thing I agree with this wacko on is being antivivisection.
It is not. All they have is memozine.
While dementia is not curable or reversible, there are certain things that can improve functionality.  My father showed a big change when moving from our home to a memory care unit where he can be around other people and have more assistance.  Went from basically sleeping all the time to sometimes feeding himself and verbalizing needs.  We know there won't be a ""recovery"", but some ""improvement"" is possible.",2022-03-08 11:06:03,Commercial-Mud32,t9k3i1
Dementia,Is anyone else feel like they are under performing at work and in a state of numbness going through this?,This grief I have felt for so long with my dad going through dementia I’m worried I will never break out the fog and feel like me again. My libido is gone. My energy is gone and I can’t remember the last time I was anything like myself. Will this ever pass?,"I totally understand. I feel like my life is on constant hold because of my mom and her dementia.
I’m so sorry you are going through this.  I am being very honest and blunt but unfortunately your grief, anxiety, and stress won’t pass until your dad does.  Then, it will be sadness but relief. They will no longer be suffering.   What helped me in an odd way is that as the executor of her estate, I was still super busy for months after mom’s death.  But a productive busy, if you will. I wish you all the best and I hope you have friends or family you can talk to.  And I wish I had known about his forum before my mom died - it would have been so helpful to me.  Now, I hope I can help others.
I feel you. I transferred to work with my dad, but had to spend a year getting him diagnosed and retired. Now, I'm just kind of blah about the job because that place meant so much to him. Even though I've become friendly with some colleagues, I've been ready to move on for a few months. Now that my dad has sort of leveled off, I'm able to focus on my life more. I know he was always proud of me and wouldn't want me stop living on his account. But there were a few weeks when I just wasn't motivated to do anything beyond basic function. Thankfully, I have my family to keep me going. Just hold tight those around you. Take care.
Oh yeah, I have some much frustration with my mom’s illness, it’s hard not to feel mad ALL THE TIME, because what do I DO with the anger? Or yeah…just go numb with depression. I struggle with feeling like a bad: daughter, mom, spouse AND employee. It sucks. No one really understands either.
I took a semester off of college to get my dad moved near us. Now it's a year off, because he's in the hospital. I'm in regular therapy, and my therapist insisted on shortening the time between sessions bc of my depression. My house looks like shit. Family dinners have turned into ""what haven't I ordered from door dash recently?"" Idgaf about my appearance. Let laundry pile up for weeks until I had no clothes to wear (I have kids, too, so the guilt, even though they weren't wearing dirty clothes). No support from my partner. Sleep is all fucked up. Mental, physical, emotional exhaustion is overwhelming. Guilt about telling my dad he needed to quit drinking, because it was ruining our relationship, which landed him in the hospital.

I know there's more that you're struggling with that you're not sharing. I just want you to know that you are not alone. You're still killing it. There are days when I just want to lie in bed all day. And I don't even have a job right now! You're my inspiration. I cannot imagine my position, with the stress of a job alongside it. 

I wish the best for you.
I did well at work while mom was alive. Now that she has died, I feel the way you describe. Whether it's the trauma of being a care taker, Covid, the state of the world, or what, I'm having a hard time caring right now.
You are not alone.  My wife and I are going through this in relation to her mom's decline with late-stage Alzheimer's.  I do believe, do hope it will pass.
I was just telling my therapist this today.  My work is starting to suffer because I'm overwhelmed and exhausted.  You're not alone, OP.  

I hope you start feeling like yourself again, and perhaps you would benefit from therapy too?
Yup. I don't even have caretaking responsibility the vast majority of the time, but it's still taking a toll. My mom is only 64, and I've been watching her decline for about 8 years, worrying about her future, wondering how she'll manage when my dad passes (he's several years older and not in great health). And of course I worry that my brain will go the same route hers is going. It's a lot to carry on a daily basis.
Can relate. I’m convinced years of caregiver stress has made me slower and less sharp. I wonder how much this might improve some day and how much is permanent. Feeling like I’m not doing great at work causes more stress so it’s just a big frustrating and exhausting anxiety sandwich. Good luck to you.
Same! I feel ya!

Dementia,Rediagnosis,"My dad, formerly diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, has been rediagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy. It doesn't change anything obviously, but it explains his symptoms and rapid deterioration much better.


Mostly he appears to be early stage, with some of his symptoms presenting mid stage. Palliative care will become mandatory as his mobility decreases and he requires more help to toilet, shower and eat.


Thank you to everyone on this sub for being so supportive and honest when I asked how realistic I was being regarding caring for my newborn and dad at once - the new diagnosis will all but guarantee that when I finish maternity leave at Christmas time, he will enter palliative care, but for now he is safe here and his decreasing mobility makes him less of a risk yo my child as things progress.","Ah, sandwich generation! God bless you. What a pile-up of responsibilities. We can all do only so much. Thank you.
I'm sorry for your dad's new diagnosis.  Just in case it hasn't happened, a PSP diagnosis should only ever be made by a movement disorder specialist.  If this isn't the case for you guys, I highly recommend a referral to one for another opinion.",2022-03-08 02:28:24,ParentalAnalysis,t9bfnl
Dementia,I need help on what activities are good for dementia care,"My relative has dementia. And I'm shopping around some activities for him. 

So far I have mix and match card games. (I turn cards over and he picks two and I flip them only for him to try to remember where previous cards were). 

I also got a coloring book. 

Which is better for coloring. Markers, crayons or pens ?

Any advice I can have for activities?","Do they like to bird watch? We take a couple of pine cones from the yard, tie them together at the top, put peanut butter on them then roll them in bird seed. Then we hang the finished product in front of the window and watch! The birds take a few to find it so you could do one to start the process, then when you and your loved one do one together there will be instant success 🐦🐣
Painting on clay or wooden figurines, Legos,something sensory like playdough maybe,listen to music,fidget toys or blankets,string beads,blow bubbles,play catch with a soft ball,sort socks or other items,look at photographs or magazine's. Depending on where their at with dementia or what stage their at, its hard to keep a loved one busy my uncle likes arranging fake flowers lol! Good luck OP☺ Also he has a flip sequin stuffed dog that he loves to pet relentlessly.
I use coloring books with coloring pencils for my mom and my dad loves puzzles and word searches.  I usually get him 300-500 piece ones for the puzzles. Anything with more than 500 gets too intense for him.  Hope this helps!
I give my mom coloring books, too.  I think that it depends on your relative's preference and the advancement of their dementia on what works best for them to color with.  

My mom loves gel pens with glitter, but I think that she will need to switch to markers soon.  I would go with something like the washable Crayola Supertips.",2022-03-08 00:23:15,wabberjockybrah,t99h0n
Dementia,I want my mom to keep her phone,"But unfortunately the dementia is progressing rapidly and she keeps saying she is going to call the police. Is there any way to let her have her phone with full functionality but block her from being able to call the police? Or is there a way to let the police know that calls from that line should be disregarded?

Thanks for the help","There is no way to block 911 on a cell phone. I think with a landline there's a service and device you can use to do that. Telecalm I think?

As far as three police go, any 911 calls have to be responded to. And those bills get high after a few false calls. 

My MIL called the police and reported a break in (she thought people were breaking in and stealing her toilet paper, which she was actually throwing away).
Look into RAZ Mobility. They make a phone for Alzheimer's patients, and you can pay for a service where 9\`11 calls from the phone get rerouted to RAZ emergency dispatcher instead of directly to 911.
If it’s an iPhone, you can put it in airplane mode and she will still be able to use the Internet but she won’t be able to make phone calls. 

Also, you can disable 911 automatic dialing but she will still be able to dial 911. 

On landline, there is a way to block 911 calls. 

I’ve read of one case where a person with dementia repeatedly dialed 911 and was charged $3k for each call. I certainly sympathize with you.
How about a iPod touch? Then she will have internet access, and facetime voice calling, but no phone capability
YESSS!! Razmobility!!!
It's a little pricy but worth it! You control it through an online portal... you can set it to only send and receive calls from the contacts you enter (cuts out robo/scam calls) and each contact appears with either just a picture of the person or their name AND picture. The picture is big so they can see it easily. 

From the portal you can see geo location,  battery status,  and also set the power button on the loved ones phone to never turn off (so they can't turn it off either on purpose or accidentally). There IS a 911 bar on the screen but you can buy the additional service that lets the 911 calls go to a screening service. It's $7.99/month or $80/year. They will know the person calling has dementia (or whatever other conditions you want them to know about) and will send the pre-determined contacts a text so they can help the loved one. If they think there is a real emergency, they will notify the contacts AND 911 :) This will often be helpful if the loved ones memory care unit/facility doesn't want them to have a phone... some are worried there will be a lot of ""fake"" 911 calls. 

However, this is also peace of mind for us because it won't just go un-noticed that our loved one is distressed and give us chances to help them. In other words, no one at the place can cover it up...
There are some great responses in the comments. I tried using Alexa Studio so my mom could say, ""Call Sally"" and have the call go to Sally. The key was that it could only call people in her contacts.  In the end, my mom was further advanced than we anticipated and she was not able to really use it.

Dementia,aunt threatening to put my grandpa somewhere,"i live with my grandparents & aunt who came to help when my grandfather had a stroke, he’s since had a second stroke and is nearing some of the later stages of dementia soon but he still eats and walks with a walker and talks, he remembers mostly just important things but has bad short term memory. he cannot go to the bathroom or do any hygiene on his own so my aunt and grandma do it. he’s very combative and angry so when they clean him (maybe he feels uncomfortable?) he starts yelling and him and whoever is cleaning him start fighting if he hits them. he likes me a lot and attaches to me, he listens to me maybe 90% of the time maybe bc i don’t fight with him so therefore i beg to help as he’s much more calm with me but they won’t allow it. my grandma does not want to put him in a nursing home but my aunt has been coercing her and my grandma feels backed into a corner and has begun calling places. i understand it’s hard for everyone but i think it’s wrong as my grandpa has verbally expressed numerous times that he absolutely does NOT want to go to a nursing home. Now my aunt just said if he gets violent and hits her one more time she’s going to call somebody to have him ‘picked up and taken away’ saying she will tell them he’s a danger to the family. is this even possible? i love my grandpa and i think that doing that to him would be honestly beyond cruel. i live in Florida and i’m not sure if this could even happen, does anybody know?","So sorry you're in this position. Just for background sake, what is the objection to you helping with hygiene? And what authority does the aunt wield in the decision-making process? Does she have power of attorney? Own the home? Pay rent to live there? Without doxing yourself can you give us approximate ages of interested parties?
Perhaps you could talk to your Grandma about getting a paid caregiver in to help with bath times.  It's possible that he'd be less combative with a caregiver who is the same gender as he and unrelated.  Having his daughter bathe him could be making him feel ashamed.  That said, if he's violent and combative he could be a risk to your aunt and grandma.  It's hard to believe that they'd actually hurt anyone but it happens more often than you'd think.
Its not really cruel, honestly. My mom made it clear she never wanted to live in the care home she worked at, but after she had her stroke, we had no other options. We felt bad about it, but we had to. 

I can understand both sides honestly. I really have no advice, i just know that as a nurse's aide wirking a dementia ward, i jnew part of my job was taking abuse from combative residents. It sucks, but it's part of the job, and i got (under)paid for it. Your family gets that abuse without getting paid? I can see why a care home might have to be an option",2022-03-07 21:24:03,rubberducky073,t96636
Dementia,"Mom was just diagnosed w early stage vascular dementia but based on what I’m seeing, it seems more advanced? Is that possible?","After several hours of a neurocognitive psych eval two weeks ago, combined w results from an MRI done in June 2021, her neurocognitive psychologist gave the diagnosis of “mild cognitive impairment” & “early stage vascular dementia” but based on what I’ve seen (I live w my mom) I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. Here are just a few examples: 
1. She wrongfully believed she had cancer and told everyone that she was having a hysterectomy for her cancer 
2. She cannot drive to any place she does not already know 
3. When she drives w both hands on the wheel she wobbles and weaves 
4. She cannot remember how to use her cell phone to do simple things like make a phone call—she could not remember my phone # the other day & could not figure out how to call me despite it being saved in her contacts
5. Backing out from the driveway, she hit a parked car (owner didn’t contact insurance, he said it was an old car & didn’t matter)
6. She never knows what day it is, misses appts or shows up on the wrong days/times 
7. She gets aggressive & violent w me over nothing 
8. She’s sedentary 24/7 

She is intelligent and charming and knows how to “turn it on” long enough to fool someone during a phone call. I am keeping a list of all of my concerns to share w her neurologist, but that appt isn’t until the end of April. I am worried she may hurt someone in the meantime w her driving, but I also can’t say anything to her doctors in front of her (she was abusive to me growing up & frequently explodes at me when she feels I’m “under-riding her authority”.) In your experience, have doctors sometimes misdiagnosed dementia? Is there anything more I can be doing to keep her and others safe? I’m really stressed and I keep communicating w her doctors but it feels like it falls on deaf ears.","Sorry I don’t have the answers but I don’t think your mom should drive . My mom a year before we knew she dementia was in a car accident - probably due to the dementia and lack of judgment
The ""early"" and ""mild"" descriptors are aggravating as hell when we're already alarmed at the drastic changes in our loved one's cognitive and physical abilities.   It seems that the ""moderate"" descriptor doesn't apply until the sufferer can basically do very little for themselves (meal prep, bathing, dressing, household tasks) but can still make a little conversation and use a fork.   In other words,  I feel your pain.

And, yes, they can still charm their way through short ""tests"" like phone calls or even an in-office visit where the provider does most of the talking, but doing so with cognitive tests administered by a gerontologist, neurocog psych, etc is another story.  Those tests have a little wiggle room, but not much -- either she can accurately identify the giraffe and draw a clock, or not.   

Keeping a list of your concerns and observations is critical to ensuring they see the full picture.  Since speaking candidly to her physician in her presence will cause fireworks, email or call him/her with your questions/observations to him/her ahead of the appointment.  Believe me that you are not alone in doing this -- even if the loved one wasn't abusive and/or doesn't have an explosive temper -- very few adult children feel comfortable early in the process to be candid.  Later on, as your Mom's abilities to continue to decline, your comfort level in frank discussion in front of her will likely increase.

As far as her driving, check with your state's department of transportation.  Some states offer the option to ""report"" a driver with cognitive issues.  The DOT then uses the report as a reason to give them a road driving re-test.

Has your mother completed Power of Attorney documents naming someone she trusts to manage her financial and healthcare business?
Judging by these examples, she should *not* be driving! If she can't remember how to make a phone call, she might not remember which is the gas pedal and which is the brakes very soon. Wobbling and weaving on the road can cause her to get pulled over, and that could be *disastrous*, especially if she gets aggressive at the drop of a hat. Finally, if she were to hit another person's car, they might not be so kind as your neighbor was. It's extremely risky and endangers not only her, but other people. Do whatever you can to stop her from driving.
My mom was diagnosed with early vascular dementia a couple years ago. It didn't take long for my sister and I to throw that ""early"" part out! Like your mom, mine can turn it on. It took weeks to get anyone else to see it but we soon took her keys away and now, just a couple years later she is sure her best friend died. Every. Single. Day! And she gets so angry compared to who she used to be. Don't worry about the early term, you're there and you should be the one saying how far along this is.
Did the neuropsychologist interview you or someone else other than your mom? For a diagnosis of dementia (so greater than mild cognitive impairment) you need to prove the person has functional impairment (can’t do finances or drive or something like that). Sometimes if a patient or family denies any functional impairment because of poor insight (like it sounds like your mom has) the neuropsychologist would be forced to diagnose MCI instead of dementia. From your description, it sounds like your mom has mild to moderate dementia. I know other comments mentioned a timeline/prognosis, but there is no clear prognosis, it’s different for every patient based on their risk factors and contributing causes.
About the driving. Do consider what will happen if God forbid she would kill someone in a car accident right? So in order to keep her from being angry with you about taking her keys which is very confrontational truthfully, you can just disconnect the battery cable under the hood. That way the car won't start and she can't go anywhere. You can tell her that you will take it to the shop to get it fixed and then just never bring it back until she progresses enough to not care. Another thing you could do is put a note on top of the battery under the hood so that if she calls a repair person on her own oh, they will see the note telling them she has dementia and must not drive and for them to tell her it can't be fixed at the moment. Some sort of thing like that will be your best bet to keep her fairly calm about it and to make sure she's not angry with you and fighting about the keys. It doesn't have to be the battery even. You could flatten the tires every night or swap out the key is for different keys that don't work for her car or tell her there's our been a recall and it has to go to the shop oh, there's plenty of ways to do it without taking the keys LOL
I am sorry to say this but vascular dementia advances pretty quickly. It may be in the beginning stage but it is a serious and severe condition. The maximum life expectancy after diagnosis is 5 years. It doesn't sound like the doctors have it wrong, they just perhaps didn't effectively communicate what to expect.

I'm sorry about your mom. My grandma died of vascular dementia/brain atrophy in June, just 2 years after diagnosis. She showed all of the symptoms your mom is showing in the beginning and a year and a half later, she was mostly bedridden and wouldn't eat or use the toilet.
Thanksgiving dad went to VA center with vascular diagnosis. He could walk with walker. Went to see him Sunday and he is bedfast, needs fed minced food. He has had Covid and reoccurring pneumonia. 

Sad disease.
There are different ways dementia can be classified, early moderate and severe are the common ones. Early stage doesn’t necessarily mean they have just mild symptoms, especially with vascular which can affect all areas of the brain. Depending on the ‘definition’ the doctor / neuropsych chose, it still might technically fit.
For example in some classifications, severe dementia is when people can no longer walk or swallow, but someone might have symptoms we would consider severe like constantly wandering and aggression and not able to communicate but based on that classification they are still ‘moderate’. 
I’m sorry you are going through this and I’m not sure what support services are available in your area. Is there a dementia specific organisation in your area? Where I’m from there is a national dementia hotline you can call for advice and guidance, and they have great online resources too
If your mother still recognizes you than she's definitely not in the late stages. Mother has this for around 7 years, this year has become the worst as far as decline goes.  She's in a nursing home with 24/7 care.
Damn - I’m looking for insights here - I’m in a VERY similar situation .. 3 years now but I moved in and do all the driving / finances. The driving is a no go (she was having blackouts), but the doctor were still allowing her to drive (still with the MCI). No new diagnosis but confusion has gotten substantially worse and life memories are scrambled as hell (in addition to all you mention). 

She does drive, but only when I am in the car
My stepfather was pulling up to a key shop in a strip mall. He hit the gas pedal instead of the brake, and drove his Lexus right into the shop. Only the very large and sturdy front desk stopped him from continuing into the back portion of the shop. The owners were nice and he (without insurance involved) paid for everything to be redone. But Mother had his keys taken away at that point. Step dad was very very lucky to have not smashed anyone who might have been at the counter as a customer.
I'm sorry about your mother. My mom has VD and ALZ. It's just awful. 

I don't worry too much about the ""Scale"" for where she is - it seems pretty general, and she can be a ""3"" in one thing and a ""7"" in another. It really sounds like your mother has far more than mild imparment. One thing though.. the driving. You've got some huge red flags waving:

* When she drives w both hands on the wheel she wobbles and weaves
* She cannot drive to any place she does not already know
* Backing out from the driveway, she hit a parked car (owner didn’t   
contact insurance, he said it was an old car & didn’t matter)

For her safety and the safety of others on the road, she needs to stop driving *immediately*. It's a hard thing for them to lose, but better than than kill someone or injure them badly. Plus any sort of liability that would arise from her having an accident - especially now that she's got a diagnosis. I'd enlist the help of your doctor's office. 

I contact my mom's doctor without her knowledge - even if you don't have the legal status to have them share her medical information, you can *share* what's going on with them. I send messages via the patient portal before every visit and if anything happens that I feel they should know about. It's very helpful and they're actually grateful so they can prepare for her visits.
This was exactly my mom and situation to the T. I knew it was much worse than mild. That was Jan 2020. She’s progressing w the disease. At this point she remembers most people but not always. She lived wirg me and now my sister. It’s the worst
Also it’s HARD but you must stop her from driving.
I tried like heck to take away my dads car keys … he always found a way to drive … ended up getting in a bad car accident that almost killed him and seriously injured the other driver … don’t hesitate to get her out of the drivers seat .. we fought, just not hard enough",2022-03-07 17:11:18,SuchMatter1884,t90zpa
Dementia,Need help on small activities,I am currently doing work experience in a care home with some dementia patients in and I was looking for some advice on activities to do with the people to get them to do something they’d like. Thank you,"I had luck getting small, unfinished wooden toys and having my dad sand them (think birdfeeders, toy cars things like that).  

Making cookies and muffins was always popular.  (the activities director always had a real batch of batter in the fridge to replace unusable ones).  Everything from just stirring the batter and adding fruit, nuts, or chocolate chips to being given pre-measured ingredients to make the batter.  

Batting balloons back and forth either with their hands or two-foot sections of fun noodles was amazingly popular.  They'd go on for an amazingly long time.  

Sing-along sessions to old, familiar songs was also well-liked.  (don't forget to include hymns, and commercial jingles)
If you are working with a small group of residents, then depending on their level of ability you could get them to collaborate on recreating something like van Gogh's vase of sunflowers painting (can't remember the name). They could each paint a flower and you could stick them all together in the ""vase"" (also a painting) to finish it off.

The christmas before this last one, i got mine making tree decorations out of coloured pipe cleaners and beads - candy canes, wreaths and so on.

If you can lay hands on some real flowers and small glass vases then you could get them doing flower-arranging, which is a great social activity as well as a physical one.
My dad loves to do things that make him feel helpful, like organizing things, dusting, etc.",2022-03-07 16:44:58,that_1_ginger,t90dmr
Dementia,Fast deterioration mentally,"Can dementia happen really quickly? I've always thought it took a decade or two of gradual decline but I'm worried about my mother. She's 82. My dad died a year ago and her dog died a month or two later, so she's now living on her own. Since then she's declined quite quickly. I thought initially it was just because my dad had done all the practical stuff and she was out of her depth having to make decisions (even though I've been doing most stuff), but it's more than that now.

She stayed with me for a few weeks in November and I had to label my bins because she couldn't work out what rubbish went where, even though I told her a couple of times. She's now labelled her own bins as well. She couldn't work out how to put the lid on my kettle or use the chain on the front door. I got suspicious in December when she called a wine glass a ""stemmed tumbler"" - it's technically accurate, but no-one ever says that! She's used odd wording a few times since then but she's now tending to call everything ""stuff' because she doesn't know the word. She keeps telling me about things she can't find because she can't remember where she left them.

She's now finding lots of things confusing. She can't find the words and admits to feeling muddled.  She's on a number of pills and I asked her today how she knew what pills to take when and she just stood there. She had no idea how to explain herself even though she had lists of her pills and a schedule in her hands. She was in tears because she knows something's wrong. She's doing well at keeping lists and documenting what she's done,  and keeping her calendar up to date, but it's getting harder for her.

Her speech seems to have slowed down in recent weeks.

She admits to feeling slow and muddled and gets upset so I try not to push her about it. She thinks one of her medications is to blame and wants to stop taking it, but this started before she started those pills. Certainly it's much worse now, but she's only been on those pills for a month or so. 

Can it really happen that fast? I've started insisting I'm present for her doctor's appointments, which she's happy about because she can't remember what the doc says, but I'm worried about upsetting her by asking the doctor about it in case I'm wrong. It seems too sudden, but I don't think it's the pills - they may be making it worse, but I don't think they're the cause.","I agree that it can happen fast. The early signs were likely things you missed and her husband helped compensate for. Now it’s much harder for her to hide her impairment plus her impairment is increasing. That makes it seem sudden to you, but it likely started years ago if only someone had noticed and convinced her to follow up on it. Spouses are the most likely ones to notice changes, but they are also often ones to brush it off or help cover those changes.
Yup. 6-7 years ago my mom was taking care of ME when I was sick. 5 years ago she helped me pack my kitchen and move. Today, she doesn’t know how to put pants on. She doesn’t know she peed herself. It is SHOCKING. It’s hard to deal with becusee it happened so fast . I remember the exact last normal time I spent with her. We went to a museum in October . Normal. By Christmas - she was hunched over walking , frozen arm , had Parkinson’s but we didn’t know it and she had anxiety. A year later - car accident. A year later official diagnosis with Parkinson’s dementia . Overall her decline took place rapidly In 3 years including maybe a 30 lb rapid weight loss.
She may have had a stroke, or several small strokes (transient ischemic attack).  It could also be that it's a side effect of one of the meds she's taking, or an interaction between the meds.  It's great that she recognizes that she has trouble remembering things and even better that she wants you to go to the doctor with her.

If she hasn't given you authorization to make medical and financial decisions for her yet, get that done now while she's lucid and capable of executing those documents.  Better to have them and not need them than to need them and not have them.
It can happen fast. My mom was declining slowly than COVID lockdowns made her crash quickly. First thing is first, with all that death and changes, mental health may be to blame. Get in to see a neurologist ASAP and let them do an assessment. 

From there you are doing what you need to do. If the signs are there and the neurologist notes the decline, begin getting both legal and financial affairs in order. Good luck.
My grandmother’s decline was fast- my mom and I noticed the first symptom when she was visiting us in the fall of 82’ (maybe October?)- we were driving in the car and she wanted to talk about the relatives who just visited us (these relatives were long deceased). I got into an argument with her (what THE HECK, grandma- nobody visited us!), but she insisted I was wrong. Mom took her to the doctors and they determined she had Alzheimer’s (I felt so guilty about that argument with her!). She stayed with us from that October to the following April (we had day help while she stayed with us- I was in high school and my mom worked), when she had a medical crisis and had to be admitted to the hospital. She passed away a week later. Her decline was so fast, and it was so sad because she was such an amazing grandma.
It can happen really fast but in  my dad's case the decline had been going on for years I probably didn't notice it until 5 years in but looking back at the symptoms I can see it clearly now. The really rapid decline happened with a change in his circumstances. My mom passed away and I brought him up to live with me. As soon as we drove away from his familiar patterns, I could see that his dementia was far, far worse than I had realized. I think he was compensating because he lived in the same place for 20 years and done the same thing. But now it's all new to him. Even though he has the exact same kitchen faucet at his house, I've had to explain to him several times how to make the hot water run. I could give you a countless other examples but I'm sure you could say the same. Hang in there; it's very shocking to see a parent that you used to think had it somewhat together completely fall apart.
I would be concerned about her medication. My Grandma began taking too many pills because she would forget she already took them.
Yep, it can come on fast. It’s also likely she’s been in a decline for a time but was able to hide it well from everyone due to your dad being able to help her through day-to-day activities.  Once he passed, she didn’t have someone to correct her, to keep her on schedule, and to help with her daily needs, it would become more obvious what she was incapable of doing for herself.
It can, especially if she has gone through that grief of her husband and dog dying - that’s going to exacerbate things, plus staying in an ‘unfamiliar’ environment can make things more obvious. habits and routine can cover a lot of cognitive decline which is made obvious when circumstances or the daily demands change. Word finding difficulty and language changes are pretty common and it sounds like her short term memory and problem solving is affected too, sounds very hard for you both. are you able to go with the fact she admits to feeling muddled and offer to take her to get it investigated? If there is something wrong there are treatments that can slow progression and give you the chance to get things in order before it’s too late. If there isn’t anything wrong that that’s a weight off both your shoulders! All the best
She needs to see a doctor. There are so many things it could be. Like other people posted stroke, but also in elderly a simple urinary tract infection could cause major confusion. It happened to my mother.
First thing is that she needs someone else to be in charge of the meds. Don't leave them where she can get at them either. Make sure she gets the right ones at the right times, consistently. Have a talk with the Dr and ask for a full metabolic panel to be done. This is a blood test and they check EVERYTHING with this one. She could have a UTI, one or more electrolytes could be off, etc. She is probably right about it being her meds tho... look for anything that might be too strong, have undesirable side effects, or have known interactions with each other. Don't forget that supplements, vitamins, and over the counter products can ALSO cause interactions. Make sure she isn't drinking... Lack of sleep is a HUGE factor in forgetfulness as well. If you doubt that, consider that sleep deprivation is a known torture technique!! Make sure she's sleeping enough. Be sweet to her, take your time, don't quiz her or rush her. Nothing is more important than for her to feel safe and loved. They are surprisingly good at the non-verbal stuff. If you are stressed or angry or sad or whatever, they can tell. You are doing a great job and remember that. You are doing your best and that's all anyone can do so be sweet to yourself as well :) she is lucky to have you!!
it can happen like this because she does not have any stimulation given the passing of her husband and loss of the dog as well. these contribute.
Definitely get her seen by a neurologist asap. There are some medications that can slow the decline.
It all depends on the person, the type of dementia, and probably has a lot to do with losing the support of your dad who very likely worked in tune with her to make up for her deficits.
In my experience with my mom, it can happen pretty fast.  In the last 3 months, my Mom has become occasionally incontinent of urine, more agitated, more forgetful, started wandering, and paranoid.  Prior to that, she was progressing, yes, but much more slowly.  In fact, in December, I thought it would be probably right around the end of this year or early next year when she will need a skilled nursing facility (she's in stage 6 Alzheimer's) but now?  I'll be surprised if she's still at home in 6 months. 

&#x200B;

I'm sorry you're going through this, OP. It's a devastating situation.
Get her tested for a UTI. Often she will return to her old baseline with antibiotics.
Btw i recommend getting a little journal to track her doctors visits. This is the one we used.

Dementia,I need advice on getting my aunt to change her brief.,"My cousin was left with the care of his 90 something grandmother and I sit with her occasionally when he had to go out.  I’m with her now and my cousin apologized because it’s very obvious that she needs her brief changed, but wouldn’t do it before I came. She fights him on it every time. I told him I’d try, but she insists, defiantly, that she just changed it. I don’t know what to do.","Lie. Say ""here's your brief that you asked for."" Don't ask her if she wants to change it, tell her it's her idea -- the thing she said she wants to do
Try agreeing with her while also telling her it is time.  

""No! I just changed it.""

""Yes! You're right! And now it is time to change it again.""

If it needs to badly be changed the color or weight will have changed.

Dementia,Memory loss caused by dementia or depression?,"My father is in his fifties and complains about severe memory loss which has manifested in the last year. Sometimes he can’t even read a sentence and remember it. He has a vast amount of interests though and when he acquires new information in any of these fields, he doesn’t seem to have any problems at all. Do dementia/Alzheimer‘s patients portray this as well? Especially given the big discrepancy in memory retention depending on whether he‘s interested or not, it seems more likely to be a symptom of his depression (and therefore reversible), which has gotten more severe over the last year.","You should encourage your father to get a proper check-up.  There are so many treatable things that can cause memory issues.   

Anecdotally, one of the first things I've noticed with all my loved ones with dementia is the inability to learn new skills.
My husband can’t find anything in the cupboard but if I mention an interesting fact, he’ll “mansplain” it back to me a few days later! He can tell you anything about his former trade except where exactly any of the job sites are. Memory is selective and the means of retrieving those memories are still being studied.
Severe depression can manifest exactly like dementia. There is also such a thing as depression with psychotic symptoms where they can experience paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations in addition to memory loss and cognitive decline. That's what my MIL has been diagnosed with. I'm on this sub because her symptoms are exactly like those of someone with moderate to severe dementia (her neurologists words) and it's helpful to hear how others care for people with these symptoms, as the community of people with severe depression, and  their caregivers, is not as large. 

The maddening/hopeful part of this is that technically with the right treatment and medication my MIL could actual get better, as opposed to someone with true dementia. The unfortunate thing is her paranoia/delusional thinking is so ingrained that she's completely treatment resistant. We are now looking at residential treatment options for her as our last ditch effort before assisted living. It's sad because her life doesn't have to be this way, but we can't force her to care about/for herself, just like we can't make her be happy. 

My advice would be to help your dad get a handle on things now. Get him to a doctor, encourage medication if that's what's prescribed, and get your dad to engage in his hobbies again. But always remember, you can't live his life for him. He has to choose to improve things, if it is depression and not true dementia.
When my husbands symptoms first started it was after the death of his dad. We assumed it was stress and sadness. His own psychologist assumed it was depression related….and since at the beginning they have a lot of good days sprinkled with the bad ones..it seemed to make sense. And let’s be honest we were both hoping that was the case. The alternative was scary. 
It wasn’t until after a year later and a couple of antidepressants and he was still having issues that I suspected there was something else going on. I had to push him to go to a neurologist who suggested a clinical psychologist who does these all day evaluations. They then make you wait a year and do the tests again and measure differences. That’s how we finally got a diagnosis of frontal temporal dementia. 

All that to say…if you feel like there’s something more to it, listen to your gut and get them evaluated. 
What’s the worst that can happen? You rule out the big scary? And if it IS the big scary, the sooner you know and can start meds and treatment, the better.",2022-03-07 09:40:33,FashionRepLover69,t8qnkv
Dementia,Transitioning to assisted living,"Hello all. I’ve been looking at this thread for a long time for comfort purposes. My father in law has vascular dementia, he’s 64. My husband has been unwilling to get guardianship and make him go to assisted living up until last night for some reason. FIL has been living in his house, his wife passed from cancer about a year ago which was very stressful and I’m sure caused some acceleration that’s evident. He’s only recently been diagnosed with dementia, but I’ve been thinking it for a long time. My husband, SIL, and BIL needed more convincing so I’m glad we got the diagnosis. Anyways, he is so depressed and miserable. He has not showered for months (last time he showered he was forced to because he was in the hospital). He doesn’t trust himself to cook anymore. He can’t hold many conversations, but rather repeats the same conversations over and over. He latched onto topics like, he’s going to be homeless. Or, he’s going to run out of money, or his daughter will be homeless. He can’t shower because the water is too expensive. There’s no food in the house even though there is always food. All of these statements are not true. He won’t allow home nurses to come into the house, so assisted living it is. We found a really really nice place. But I know we will have to threaten police…. It will definitely be a kicking and screaming ordeal. And, he is miserable as it is. He experiences no joy or happiness day to day. And I think he will be miserable there as well. Does anyone have transition tips or tips for dementia with depression?","sounds like you're doing the right thing OP. Yes it will be hard and unpleasant but you can't leave him to his own devices if he can't look after himself. Is there any way you could get a social worker involved? My dad also wasn't keeping himself clean and it led to a massive infection on the back of his neck and head that took 7 months to completely heal. Ever tried to bandage the back of someone's neck and head? it was awful. If there are community supports then reach out and find some. My dad also didn't want home care but we got it for him anyways telling him it was this or he moves out, you better believe he got on board right quick. Even if he is refusing community help , it doesn't mean he will refuse them when push comes to shove and they arrive at the door. Try it out anyways and explain to him why it's necessary and what will happen if he refuses. The more community support you can get into place before the move the easier it will be for everyone. Lastly while he might be experiencing depression there is also apathy caused by Dementia, which is much harder to treat because it's not so much that they are depressed but that they sort of just become extremely withdrawn and it presents as depression. The lack of bathing, eating, participating in hobbies are all signs of this, they sort of just slowly shut down. This is how it is with my dad, sure he could bathe himself and do laundry, he's mobile enough, he just won't 🤷‍♀️ it's like they just don't think of it anymore.
I’m sorry you’re goi g through this. We are preparing my 78 year old mom now for assisted living . Sometimes she can’t stand my dad and wants to other days she says no. I have tried to market it to her not as a “home” but as a condo that is safe, relaxing, they’ll cook for her , take care of her and she won’t be so lonely . She has no friends anymore , any friend woild be a care taker anyhow now since she can’t really hold a proper conversation. But at least there would be more social activity which must be somewhat more helpful than sleeping and barely watching tv all day long. Try reframing where he’s going . I tell white lies to my mom all the time like she’s my child. A trip had to be cancelled as she is now incontinent. She was sad - I told her covid is so bad and that’s the reason it was cancelled
I’ve recently had to move my mum into residential care after helping her live independently for as long as I possibly could. The only thing I found  helpful was repeatedly having the conversation around how unhappy and depressed she is at the current situation, how scared and confused she often gets and that we really need to try something new. She would more often than not agree, I would explain what residential care would look like, how she would be much safer there and there will always be someone to help, rather than having to wait for me to finish work every day. She’s been there for just over a week now.",2022-03-07 09:27:25,illuminatithottie,t8qe0v

Dementia,Finally at peace,"My grandmother passed away lastnight. I'm still trying to process it. It's almost not real yet. I was with her in the end. It was quick. I thought we had more time. But I guess you never truly know. 
My heart is so heavy. I miss her so much already. 
I know I will be ok but the pain is just  so raw. So fresh.

 I'd do it all over again though. Eventhough watching her decline was hard, watching her go was gut wrenching. I wouldn't have had it any other way. 

There's so much I could say right now. Such a wide range of emotions. I just can't find the right words. 
 
She meant the world to me. She was more than just a grandmother. She raised me. She was my only parent. I am crushed. 

 But She is finally at peace. No longer confined to a bed (over a decade) no longer in pain, confused, scared.

I am so sorry for your loss. Sending peace and comfort to you.
My sincerest condolences on your loss. 🖤
I'm so sorry for your loss, OP. I hope you treat yourself with the kindness you deserve after this difficult journey. Don't be afraid or embarrassed to reach out for help if you need it. Not many people in understand what you've just been through and any aftermath you may encounter. 

 If I may offer a suggestion; It's easy to put off documenting what you may need to, including itemizing for legalities or writing down what it was like to do this and during a pandemic!, or things she told you as in old stories or who your distant relatives are, family history, where an old vase came from, etc etc. You may find you are the only one who knows. Write it all down, even just as bullet points in a notebook. It doesn't have to be like a novel. You may be surprised how valuable this is to you or your loved ones one day.

 Remember the old saying, "" The faintest notes are more accurate than the best memory.""

I wish you peace and all the good things, OP 🕊
Thank you everyone. My husband has been a trooper through all of this. He's been my rock. I'm so lucky to have him and his entire family. My grandma is all I really had on my side.

Dementia,Parkinson’s dementia and now incontinence,"Mother with Parkinson’s dementia now cannot figure out how to get dressed (puts two pants on or a shirt as pants). Now suddenly experiencing incontinence. I’ve urged my dad to move her into memory care where more structure , help , safety and to protect his own stress levels. Is incontinence a sign that the end is near ? She struggles to find words - stutters - difficulty communicating - but memory is intact. Knows who we are. Remembers events recent and a long time ago. Has certain hallucinations she holds on to as real (like she will repeatedly tell me there are kids in the house or my dad has a girlfriend , there’s NO convincing her otherwise or she will get angry so now I change the subject ). She is blissfully unaware of her condition thankfully .","No, i would say incontinence is mid stage. How often does she see a doc? She can get anti psychotic meds to help the hallucinations
Sudden onset of incontinence sounds more like a UTI (urinary track infection) and might be worth a trip the her primary care to check. The trouble getting correctly dressed my mom (72, PD/dementia) has struggled with for the last year or two, but she’s not had trouble with incontinence yet. Have you/Dad discussed the hallucinations with her neurologist? My mom was suffering them daily, always seeing random people, she got on melamine 4 months ago and they stopped completely. And yeah, there’s no arguing or convincing someone with dementia of anything, only redirection. Best wishes to you!

Dementia,Wont stop walking...8+ hours a day!,"My mom has dementia and wanders a LOT. She recently had a bad fall that unfortunately progressed her dementia and we no longer can leave her unattended while she moves around during the day. Her wandering has increased greatly and now she walks around ALL day. I am not exaggerating, after breakfast she takes off and shes around the whole day until bedtime (and even sometimes during the night). Because we don't leave her unattended, means that one of the family has to also walk for hours and hours every day. She will not sit even if we ask her to/physically get her to sit. She is not convinced to sit even with the TV on or even food.
We've tried anxiety meds, as the dr. recommended, but its done nothing.
Does anyone have other suggestions? Her AND the family are very very tired, I'm worried someone will get hurt down the line.","“MomOfMyMom” (on tiktok) put up these things that are like high baby gates to kind of keep her mom in one room when the care taker needs to leave her  alone. But her mom has fairly advanced Alzheimer’s and moves around slowly and doesn’t try to open them, idk how mobile your mom is.
My wife has bvFTD and has walked/paced non stop everyday for 3 years.  I put a pedometer on her one day and it read 18 miles!   Yes.  It’s tiring.  She paces quietly inside the house (which we have child proofed and gated)and we take her outside on a 3 mile walk in the morning and 2 miles in the afternoon.  She is like the energizer bunny.  But fortunately she goes to sleep at night without fuss and sleeps through the whole night(with the help of having diapers).

My wife is pretty sweet and now almost mute. But I guess there are worse things that people with dementia can do beside walk constantly.   One thing she likes more than walking is riding in a car.  But that has drawbacks too.

Good luck with your mom.
Unfortunately, this is a very common thing with dementia. It is also very hard to treat.

I found two links for you with some tips...

[https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/dementia-wandering-causes-prevention](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/dementia-wandering-causes-prevention)

[https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/wandering](https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/wandering)

I have worked as a nurse aide for a bit over 20 years. And success with getting a wanderer to stop wandering varies. It depends on ""what"" is causing them to wander. In the articles I linked, some give ways to eliminate some common causes for wanderers to wander. If ruling all those out does not help...there may not be anything you can do other than safety measures. :(
I was caregiver for my grandfather, 2008-2012. He wandered and pilfered in drawers. We had ""pilfer"" drawers, boxes and shelves. Kept him occupied.
Now, I am caregiver for my mom, 2017-present, and thank goodness she was wheelchair bound up until September 2021. She is bed bound now. It's been much easier caring for her. Of course, being wheelchair/bed bound has drawbacks. 
Caregiving is an adventure for certain. 
My heart goes out to you 💜.
There really is nothing you can do assuming you have already taken care of her basic needs (ie ensured pain or incontinence isn't increasing restlessness). Many people with dementia walk continuously and that's just the way it is. Sometimes the best we can do when it comes to our memory care residents is give them their meals ""to go"" as there is no convincing them to sit for a meal or for a rest.

Dementia,Gift ideas for a cantankerous father with advanced dementia and no interests,"There have been SO many gift threads here and I've gone through as many as I can, but not found anything appropriate. I was hoping someone here would have some bright ideas!

My dad (who lives with my mum) has advanced dementia but is cantankerous, grumpy, and has no interests. Before he got dementia, his hobbies were cooking and drinking, and all the gifts I got him were related to those two things. However I'm trying not to get him alcohol as he already has 2-3 beers a day (he's an alcoholic so drinking less than that is out of the question for him). Music is unfortunately a trigger for his drinking, so my parents try to avoid it as much as possible. He can no longer cook at all but forgets and gets incredibly grumpy when my mum won't let him, so anything cooking-related is likely to wind him up. He spends his days watching the news and sitting on the sofa snoozing, not doing anything, really. They do like to go out sometimes for a walk along the beachfront or to a cafe.

I've got him previous gifts of the obvious things - clocks, photobooks, etc. He would be extremely offended by things he perceives as babyish like fidget items. He already has warm, comfy clothes galore. He has no interest in activity books or anything like that (we've tried). I spend as much with him as I can already.

I'm honestly at my wits end with knowing what to get him. Does anyone have any suggestions?","Since he used to like cooking, would he like some gift cards to some good local restaurants? That way, he can have some interesting menu items, but not have to cook them himself.
Get him a metal detector for his beach walks. 

You can make it extra fun by bury metal objects in the beach for him. Depending on by laws in your area you may have to be covert about it.
You said drinking less is not an option because of his history of alcoholism. Is that due to physical dependence?  If it is more psychological, you might try non-alcoholic beer. We now give my dad one real beer and then near beer if he wants more. He doesn’t know the difference.
Is he a movie fan/ and is your mom capable of using a DVD player? Mine wasn't able to worked the electronic aspect of things but it might be an option for you... Or maybe books on tape?

Even if they can’t process experiences, if your dad is able, something to do would be pretty cool.
Maybe a gentle foot or back massager he could use while watching TV?
Any gift of food that doesn’t need to be cooked or assembled. Sausages, jellies, seasonal fruits, etc.
Maybe you can just take him to dinner to a restaurant you think he would enjoy.
He might enjoy building/assembling something or doing a puzzle. I'm trying to get something like that for my dad because he randomly loved assembling a child's toy recently.
Is he interested in history or anything like that? My grandma loves Native American art, pictures of the state she grew up in from a when she was a kid. 

I ended up finding her a book with pictures of Phoenix Arizona from the 30’s through the 60’s and she loves it. She keeps looking through it and it seems new all the time for her and makes her smile.
Maybe a box of chocolates
If he liked cooking I found this link that might be useful to you [: here](https://www.scie.org.uk/dementia/living-with-dementia/eating-well/activities-around-food.asp)",2022-03-06 15:49:07,AnythingConscious234,t8818n
Dementia,UK care home chucking my mum out with dementia because she’s unsettled!,"Since October 2020 I’ve been trying to convince my dad, who is 85 years old now, to put my beloved mum in a specialist care home for respite care, to give him a much needed break. Recently he agreed because he’s physically & emotionally exhausted, we help daily but are not caring 24/7 like he is.

We researched local dementia homes & found one recommended just for ladies with dementia & only 10 residents at a time. We took my mum to be assessed & we’re very impressed all round. Last Thursday she went in for a 2 week stay, my parents have been married 63 years & it’s the first time my dad has been without her at home, he has been lost.

Today (3 nights later), we’ve been informed they want her out because she’s been awake each night wandering & the ONE care worker on duty cannot cope as 3 other residents also wake each night! 

My mums in a strange environment unknown to her, the home specialises in dementia! It takes a while for dementia sufferers to settle & this home are chucking her out!

To me the problem here is a staffing issue, bad management in a safe number of staff to resident ratio is lacking! 
What would happen if the one staff member became incapacitated during their shift? 
Who would look after the residents who all have dementia? 
Am I being unreasonable because I’m pissed off?","This might actually be a good thing... You do not want her in a place that has all these issues... That's a joke. You 100% right, dementia sufferers take ages to adjust to anything new. It's literally took my mum so long to settle into her care home. Two weeks until she stopped having meltdowns and two months until her mood finally lifted completely. Sometimes it even unsettles her for an afternoon if I've had her out and she forgets where she lives now. If they can't cope, it's not a safe environment for your mum. It's a desaster waiting to happen. It's embarrassing for them to have to do that to your family. The situation is definitely something that needs to be flagged to the care inspectorate that covers your city.
This is outrageous. Can you report them to the CQC? That's the Care Quality Commission who regulates care services in the UK and gives them their license..I feel like they should know about this.
Let me get this straight...A facility that specializes in dementia care seriously thinks that 10 individuals with advanced cognitive impairments are going to sleep throughout the night? 

Having worked on memory care units for the last two decades I seriously have to ask.....Are they high?  

It should just be expected that half or more of them could be unsettled and wandering at any given time. THIS IS WHY THEY ARE THERE!!!!!!
Unfortunately, staffing is a huge problem all over the UK. It’s not safe at all but it’s happening everywhere. You are correct that only having one care worker on shift isn’t safe. One person alone can’t reposition someone in bed or assist with toileting safely in many cases. I’m sorry that staffing issues are having such a huge impact on you.",2022-03-06 15:49:05,NanaGert,t8817n
Dementia,Good movies for those with dementia?,"My grandmother and I rewatched Forrest Gump recently, and it completely delighted her. Any other good movie or even TV recommendations? Period pieces are welcome! All of the recommendations I’ve found on Google are “I Love Lucy” and other old shows. Looking for something a *little* more modern that she can follow and also not be bummed out by. Thanks so much!","My mom loved The Sound of Music; I was surprised. 

Normally, she only watches the news; news shows such as CBS Sunday Morning; and game shows such as Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, Match Game, and America Says.
My mom is interested in Disney movies. Most recently she has been watching Ice Age.
Ben Stiller's remake of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" was positive.
We do Hallmark movies. She enjoys them. 
But she also likes the slap stick comedy in kids movies. Despicable Me, Minions really make her laugh. Shows about Zoos are a big hit too. She enjoys animals.
Idk how old yr grandma is?  My mum is 89, so Downton Abbey series, Meet the Midwife series, even if she can't follow the story line particularly, at least it's sort of familiar to her, familiar to her childhood & teen years.  

 Strangely enough my mum loves Shaun The Sheep cartoons (but then she was an elementary school teacher all her life, so she's attuned to little kids stuff) they're only 5 or 10 mins long, and I still have to read out the synopsis for her.   The movie where the farmer went to town had an accident got amnesia & ended up a rockstar hairdresser (due to his sheep-shearing skills lol) & they went to get him back, she liked - the other movie was too silly, plot too complicated.  

  Also Keeping Up Appearances series, but we're Aussie so British stuff is very relatable, perhaps it's less so for North Americans, idk... 

 Johnny English movies (Rowan Atkinson comedy James Bond sort of spoofs), The Black Adder series 1 was best but also 2, & 4 (3 was a little too silly & shrieky lol) ... 

Sir David Attenborough nature docos like the Penguin one for eg... The Ninja Warrior competitions haha... Those doggy adoption shows, where they pair up a person/family wanting a rescue dog with doggys needing rescue... The Dog Whisperer, Yorkshire Vet... 

Most movies she can't understand or remember the plot - I simplify to ""good guys are after the bad guys but everybody is double crossing everybody else"", or ""they're searching for treasure/lost person/murderer/whatever"" or ""they're getting married but her dad is a nut and doesn't like the boyfriend"".... Don't try to explain complicated plots, keep it simple!  good luck!",2022-03-06 15:43:34,SugaryShrimp,t87wz6
Dementia,Should I be concerned?,"I’m worried about my memory since I have really short memory, I do remember things from a while back but for example I don’t remember what I did just few days ago. My grandma had dementia, and doctors told my dad to be worried and try preventing it. At the moment I’m just 25 but I already have really bad short term memory . I think to do something and 1min, sometimes 20sec later I forget about it. Then remember it after 5 mins or so. Sometimes I go to take a teaspoon but I take spoon instead. I constantly forget where is my phone.If there’s something important to do in few days I have to write it down.Just wondering if there can be any tests or exams done as it makes me anxious constantly.","I wouldn’t be worried about dementia. I would however, focus on health. That means healthy eating, exercise, good mental health, and no drugs or alcohol. It also means talking to your doctor about what is currently going on. This could be stress/anxiety, depression, or something as simple as a vitamin deficiency. There are many, many causes of memory issues like you are describing, and dementia is waaaay down the list for you.
Forgetting stuff is normal. Forgetting the use of things is not.  Here’s when you should be worried … my mom would put her clothes on backwards regularly. when we pointed it out - she didn’t really know how to fix It. She would also put a sweatshirt on as pants. So she understood it was clothes but didn’t know where it belonged. 
I would tell my mom to go brush her teeth and she would come out of the bathroom and ask which one of these items was her toothbrush: She’d have a comb, a makeup brush and toothpaste tube in her hand. She knew it was bathroom related but wasn’t sure which one to use.
When my anxiety kicks into high gear, it fucks w my ability to concentrate. But it’s taken me years and lots of therapy to even recognize my anxiety. Is it possible that you’re under a lot of stress at the moment, which could be causing some of this? 

Another thought: what you’ve described is likely not dementia, but could be a symptom of ADHD? It might help ease your mind to get evaluated for ADHD, which can in fact interfere with short term memory. Good luck, and keep us posted.
ADHD, anxiety, dehydration, sleep deprivation are all possible candidates.  Go talk to your doctor.
Dementia is different from normal forgetfulness. People with dementia have difficulty knowing and doing these types of things: What is the month & year, city you’re in, location (home, doctor’s office, etc), spell the word “world” backwards, follow a set of directions like “take this paper with both hands, fold it in half & place it on the table,” and “stand w/feet together then walk heel-to-toe.” When you picked up the wrong spoon, you eventually recognized what you did, but a person with dementia might wonder why they’re holding a spoon. If you’re still anxious, one evaluation is the [Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE)](https://www.dementiacarecentral.com/mini-mental-state-exam/amp/)
There are different versions. This is just one. The busier or more stressed we are, the more forgetful we can become. That’s not dementia. I think you’ll be relieved after reading the MMSE.
Probably adhd
My neurologist said Dementia is like using the term Cereal. There are all kinds of cereal names just like dementia names. Fruit loops, Wheaties, Captain Crunch , Etc. Dementia had many different forms like, Alzheimer’s, vascular Alzheimer’s, familial Alzheimer’s, Lewy Bodies, Parkinson’s, Etc.",2022-03-06 11:21:53,DuBroCs,t827j0
Dementia,It's a rough day today,Sending out love and positivity to everyone here battling though this disease. My dad was admitted to the hospital early yesterday morning. He has severe COPD and fought off lung cancer a little over 2 years ago. They said he has a pretty bad lung infection and the cat scan has shown a mass in his left lung. I haven't told my mom about the mass yet. I feel it's better to wait until he is back home. The last time he was admitted to the hospital (September last year) is when my mom's dementia symptoms showed up. We are so afraid she is going to decline while he is gone this time. So far so good for now. It is beyond rough trying to juggle everything that needs done around here. No time at all to do a single thing for ourselves. Thankfully I have my husband to fall back on but we are wearing thin. We can't even sleep in our own room we have to stay in the living room so my mom isn't alone. We are hoping he gets released today so we can at least sleep in our room but at the same time we know he needs the medical attention.,"Can you take turns sleeping in the living room?
God bless you.",2022-03-06 09:28:35,MrsTubbz,t7zvia
Dementia,Anyone with experience separating parents?,"My mom’s dementia is destroying my dad. He’s had literal breakdowns where he’s had to be hospitalized. They had an unhealthy relationship pre-dementia (her being borderline abusive, him acquiescing to everything). With dementia every interaction seems to give him PTSD and she seeks him out all the time since she’ll have forgotten they just talked a minute ago.

We’re soon setting off on the road to put her in an assisted living facility. One big step there is that she’s move across the country with me, her son, since I’m really the only other person she has left for support (other children live in other places as well and couldn’t take on the caregiver role).

My mom likes the idea of living close, since she doesn’t really have anyone other than my dad where she is now, and she’ll get to see me and her grandchildren who she has a great fondness for. We haven’t discussed the assisted living setup yet but I’m hopeful she’d agree to it. My dad, on the other hand, has a rich life of family, friends, and work. Moving him I think would be a strong net negative for him. He also doesn’t really need care (although someone to bring him food would be nice).

Without my mom there we as a family discussed the situation, and concluded the ideal would be for her to come, my dad to stay. 

I’m just at a loss of how to approach that. I really fear that the idea of the separation would completely derail everything. While my dad was hospitalized my mom had moments of confusion where she said my dad was just abandoning her and was quite agitated. She readily accepts 3rd party care at home, thank god, but she has no concept of just how involved her care needs are. That’s probably part dementia and part her narcissism. so I’m not sure a frank discussion about their impacts to each other would land.

Anyway, ranted for a long time, curious what others have experiences in similar situations.","Talk to an estate planner, even if you don’t think there are enough assets to warrant it. The first consultation will be free and they will give you an incredible amount of accurate pertinent information.

Divorce is a great way to protect family assets. 

The equity in the primary residence and retirement accounts are protected. But in order for Medicaid to pay for the nursing home all other assets have to be down to a very small number.",2022-03-06 08:45:53,-emanresUesoohC-,t7z242
Dementia,"It is imminent or has happened, need care-giving advice on my 59 wife becoming bed ridden.","Her neurologist changed her diagnosis from Lewy-Bodies to FTD, based on her symptoms, last year.

I think she is in stage six. Doesn’t know where she is, doesn’t recognize rooms she has been in for over 20 years. She is starting to not recognize me for a brief periods of time more frequently, but we can still hold a conversation. Her conspiracy theories and paranoia have been out of control for years. “There are  holes in the floor”, “I’m going to throw her out the window”. She’s constantly fighting with me over simple tasks, arguing, her way of doing things is better.

It is a constant struggle to manage her anger issues. She is taking numerous anti-psychotics. Before this last week, things have been relatively smooth for a few months. This last week I have been having to wrestle her to the bathroom and through her toilet routine. She’s screaming so loud through the entire process she’s losing her voice. Today I moved her around the house on a chair with wheels.

I am in good shape and strong, but she weighs 150 pounds.

Any advice on what I’m about to face and how manage it better, would be greatly appreciated.","Darn, I was hoping someone who has experience with this behaviour would have an answer as my mom has LBD and boy, I can see this scenario coming ...
You’ve worked so hard to care for her for a long time, but at some point she may just need more care than you can provide. There is no shame in passing some of that burden on to a team of professionals.
I have no advice to offer because we have not yet reached this stage.  Hoping others can give you useful advice.  I'm so sorry you are at this point.",2022-03-06 05:08:35,NewUserNameSameError,t7vt7j
Dementia,"""Grandma, you can't just hold the food in your mouth. You have to chew and swallow"" ....... ""I don't know how.""","I hoped she would no longer be aware, by the time she started to have problems swallowing. This breaks my heart. They say we are in the final weeks or even days, but they've been saying that for several weeks already. I'm ready for her to be at peace.

UPDATE: The hospice CNA visited today for her bath. She was a Doctor in her home country. She estimates about 72 hours.","Words cannot describe the pain you all must be feeling now.  I am so sorry.
I am so devastated for you.
My dad would chew his food for at long as I'd let him. I finally realized the Parkinson's finally affected the muscles of the throat and tongue. This was a sad realization for me. His step down was to Ensure's. He did that about 3 weeks until he wasn't able to hold the cup upright or replace it to his bedside table. I finally bought a spill proof cup he could use. He passed after another 3 weeks. 
NOTE: Sippy cups didn't work because he didn't have the strength to suck.

I'm sorry your at this point.
This is heartbreaking.
This happened to my grandfather, although I wasn't his carer. He lived isolated in our home country (he wasn't a nice man, he didn't have much of a relationship with any of our family) and wasn't 'discovered' to have progressed so far in his Alzheimer's and to have developed this issue until a relative went there and discovered him. I remember one of the last times I spoke to him, him saying that he was having trouble eating, but I kind of just didn't register it because I didn't even know that he had Alzheimer's at the time.  

When he was found he hadn't eaten for 2 weeks, despite obviously trying and was already unwell to begin with, he was taken to hospital but unfortunately died a short while later. I still feel terrible. 

Now that I do help care for my grandmother, who is in a similar position and very late-stage to yours with her dementia, this is starting to happen, it's so scary. I'm sorry OP.

Dementia,My mom was difficult even before dementia.,She’s had dementia for years now (13+) and I’m just over it. She just called me that she’s leaving her care home again. It wouldn’t matter where she was placed it wouldn’t be good enough for her. She was horrible before dementia and she’s more horrible with dementia. Her name is Donna and growing up she had the nickname Prima Donna - that gives you a hint as to her personality. I’m so done with her yet I’m the only family left. The disease sucks but it’s especially hard when the person sucks too.,"I'm only chuckling because - my father-in-law has dementia and was also a jerk before it. I always tell people, ""You don't get the nickname Rooster by being a loving and compassionate person""
I feel like dementia brings out the worst in people. Two of my grandparents have dementia. One was super stubborn before dementia and is now a hellion while the other was pretty calm before and is pretty chill. God help whoever has to care for me because I’m already annoying as it is.
I commend you for caring for her still! If it was my dad… game on. It’s only fair he gets treated like he treated me when I was child. Again, good on you for dealing with this horrible decay of the mind and a shitty human to begin with. You’re a better human than I!
I can relate possibly with you and I can say I have Caregiver stress syndrome. I do my research and I looked at the traits. A few don't apply but most do. My Mom is 90 years old and we got along better years ago before she got early dementia. She's got 40% hearing loss and wore a hearing amp for a couple months and didn't like it. I don't blame her because I'm not a fan of ear buds in my ears or ear plugs for a loud concert or workplace. Anyway she drinks a martini or 2 a day and she's gone through a fifth of vodka in a week. That's 750 ML. I'm the one that gets it for her because she has bad knees from arthritis and I am overwhelmed. By myself for the most part for over 2 years. I have a small dysfunctional fam. My Sister, her ex Navy Seal Boyfriend, and Nephew. My Sister and her Boyfriend are moving into her house 9 miles north of here. She's 65 and she's wrapping up a 34 year career in sales management for a Waterworks company. Yeah I'm on edge and some days are ok with my Mom and some are bad and I want to run to the hills. I have chronic pain in my feet from extensor tendinitis and some arthritis in my feet. Caused from being flat footed since I was a kid and I'm 54 years old now. Tough times but at least she has the money. I have a Social Security Disability claim pending for the 2nd time. I learned a month ago that UTIs affect dementia and my Mom has had those. Now my Dad is a Sociopath and bi polar so I'm glad I'm here in N.E GA and he's in Miami. He's a Cuban bunghole.
Can she leave her care home? Where will she go? Can’t they prevent her from leaving?
Hugs to you. I can relate. My mother has just been diagnosed (early stage vascular dementia—but I suspect it’s more progressed; her intelligence and narcissistic charm helped her to compensate when being evaluated). 
Like you, I’m the only family left, and probably codependent despite decade’s worth of therapy. Like you, my mother was horrible prior to dementia. She’s like a Jekyll/Hyde and always has been. Throughout my life there have been moments where she’s been loving and fun, but also terrifying moments where she’s been monstrously abusive. I’m trying to thread the needle between providing care for her and trying to reclaim my own life while I have time left. 💗
I really identify with what you're saying. My mom was never loving or nurturing, she withheld affection and undermined me and was the master of the silent treatment. Now, she has dementia, she's pretty deaf, she's miserable and in total denial that anything is wrong. I have siblings but do the vast majority of the work of dealing with her. I spend time with her out of obligation, but get no joy (and she literally complains while I'm visiting her that I'm the only one who visits her). I feel like I have worried about her more than she ever did about me.

It's an odd, sad position that dementia puts us care takers in.
You are not alone.  I swear my mother was a narcissist.  Dementia has only made it worse.  She would call me several times a week to yell at me for “putting her there” - I didn’t - she ended up there after an ER visit where the doc said she couldn’t live on her own.  I stopped answering the phone, because I knew what was coming.
Just made a similar post about my grandmother. She is a Narcissist and was one well before her elderly decline (still not sure of her mental status/condition). So I feel you.
This is why when people ask if my dad’s cognitive issues changed his personality, I always say no. The dementia magnified it. Lol. My dad still thinks he’s the smartest person in the room.
Wow OP - I feel this. My mother has never been diagnosed but I am sure she has BPD and our relationship has been strained if not nonexistent for many, many years. She lives clear across the country (near a good amount of relatives but they are all estranged as well except for her one sister.) She’s not a horrible/mean person at all but her mental illness doesn’t help her in the friends/family department. Anyway, I just found out yesterday that she was visiting my aunt, seemed ok, then when she left, starting driving east. Waaaay past her house. 3 hours past. She got in a minor accident and the police took her to a homeless shelter (I don’t know the details of this part yet…why not the hospital? She was in an accident!) She was there for 3 days in a disoriented state until the shelter decided to take her to the hospital. Severe dehydration and a UTI. After researching today, I know symptoms of a severe UTI mimic dementia but also know that it presents even more when there is an underlying mental situation.
Last we talked (couple years), I could tell she was forgetting things, retelling stories, etc but I kind of chalked it up to just getting old. Seems like more now. I feel absolutely obligated to step in and get things situated but with my own giant anxiety, being across the country, currently unemployed (I’m good but added expenses would be awful), etc. is freaking daunting. 
Currently I’m waiting to get the whole story from my aunt to see how we’re moving forward. Any tips for navigating this would be lovely. Thanks for listening 😊",2022-03-05 18:17:29,SelenaJnb,t7lh0w
Dementia,Mental breakdown/rant,"Idk if this is the right place to post this, but I’m done. I am a grand daughter who has been constantly abused, accused and not appreciated for almost 9 months caring for my gma. And I’m not sure if she is experiencing dementia but she has hallucinations, extreme anxiety, EXTREME, memory issues and paranoia plus more and I just can’t. Not to mention she also is a narcissist on top of that so that’s been fun. I have tried to be patient, kind, understanding and accepting. It just makes me think back to this post I saw where this person was shaming family who left their elderly relatives behind and wouldn’t come see them anymore. Some people are pure rotten, even in old age. I know my grandma could hide it well when she wanted. Refuses to go to doc appts she previously agreed to, accused me of anything even if it doesn’t make sense. Accuses me of not telling her information I have repeated many times. Refuses to accept any responsibility if she is ever wrong. Starts arguments on purpose when she is in a bad mood to release her own stress. Gaslights me. And more. And I’m done, I have had it. I have gotten NOTHING in return for helping her and even tried to save her from family who were doing shady acts and/or trying to kill her off! All I’m saying is that It may be important to look at both sides of an issue before accusing family of neglect. Maybe they tried everything. Maybe that “nice old lady” you know was incredibly abusive in her youth and continues to be now. She has done it to almost every member who was actually being helpful but refuses to yell at those who openly tricked her or don’t try to help. Sorry for the rant but I just had a breakdown.","It is perfectly legitimate for relatives of people with dementia to acknowledge their own limitations - whether they're financial, emotional, physical, or something else - and recognize that they're not able to care for their family member. That's true even if the family member is the sweetest person on the face of the earth, because caretaking is *hard* and caretaker burnout is real. I'm sorry people are judging you for making the choice that is *very obviously* the right choice for you. 

Yes, taking care of a family member is an incredibly compassionate thing to do *if you can do it*. But you also need to have compassion for *yourself*!!! You have to take care of yourself first, and it sounds like maybe you haven't been doing that, but are starting to do it now. 

Now, the relatives I *will* be judgmental toward are the ones pressuring other family members to take someone in while not wanting to do anything themselves, and those people like your family members who try to take advantage. But someone who says ""No, this is a responsibility I cannot take on""? I respect that, because that is someone who understands the magnitude of the commitment required and realizes it's not something they can offer. *There is nothing wrong with saying no*. 

Good luck to you. I hope that you are able to give yourself the compassion you've been focusing on your grandma, because you deserve it *at least* as much as she does.
Woah, I am getting strong vibes, almost to a T, of my mother. Fun fact though, she's only 61! Chin up my random internet compatriot.... I will not be the one to blame you for backing off. Hell, I just did it a week ago when my dementia patient popped positive for a couple of hard narcotics. Eff dat shiznit. Not my circus any longer
I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I am as well, and it's not an easy task.

Remember, the first person a caregiver has to take care of is the caregiver themselves.
You do not owe her your life! Don't sacrifice yourself!! Sometimes this kind of angry acting out is a stage they go through. Once their dementia gets worse sometimes they become much nicer. From what I understand depending on what type of dementia they have, some of them have big personality changes one way or the other. It's not a bad thing to dip out oh, and it's not a bad thing to expect more from your relatives. You should not have to do this by yourself and it's not on you to protect your grandmother from her own children. If you are really concerned you can contact Adult Protective Services to let them know what's going on with you and your grandma. They will not think you're a bad person I can guarantee that! They will see that you were handling more than you should have to deal with on your own and truthfully it will be much better for your grandmother if people outside the family can help her. That way your grandma is protected and you don't have all the stress and bonus is the family will turn on Protective Services not you LOL. If you are concerned about it you can do what I have done which is get a small recorder and turn that thing on anytime you are dealing with your grandma or any of the relatives. You can also get one of those nanny-cam type things and set it up in the room where your grandma spends most of her time. Just sort of a cover-your-ass move in case anyone ever tries to say that you're not doing everything you can. It might even be something for you to say I can't do this now but if things change maybe I can later but somebody else has to take this up right now instead of me. Good luck to you I know how you feel. My family is not always very supportive either although I can say that my dad is still very sweet. Earlier maybe six months or so ago, he said some pretty hurtful things to me and acted in a difficult way but he has changed and things are okay now. I'm still really sad and I know it's going to get worse but I'm going to help as long as I can until I reach my Breaking Point. If I hit that point I will definitely dip out. Good luck I'm sending you a lot of love.",2022-03-05 15:50:01,Mee27La,t7ijbd
Dementia,Conversation anyone!,"My husband has dementia, diagnosed a few years ago.  He is at that memory loss stage where conversations are hard to have yet for some reason I keep trying to engage him.  Been married 48 years now and I just want to be able to talk with him about ordinary things.  Most of the time he doesn't understand what I am talking about or he kind of does but is unable to respond.  He tries but generally forgets what he wants to say as soon as he opens his mouth to speak. Or he has something to say but the words out of his mouth make no sense at all.  We now can go for a long time without speaking to each other, silence isn't a bad thing, but it is a reminder I don't have him to share things with anymore.  So hard sometimes to witness his decline, I do try to take it one day at a time, but I know the future will be grim. Feeling sorry for myself this morning.","I am sure you feel alone, but you’re not. I am in the same place. My husband, the love of my life, is having the same kind of struggle; words are evading him, and comprehension giving in to confusion. He is not the same man I married, but I remember who he was, and although I grieve for this slow loss, I am grateful for the time we had. It’s hard to watch, right?
Hang in there, don’t forget to fill your own cup once in awhile
You have every right and reason to throw yourself a pity party every now and then.  I had a small one for myself yesterday.  My husband has dementia and memory loss along with his Parkinson's.  Some days aren't too bad, all things considered, but other days and nights range from not so good to a full blown living hell.  We've been married 40 years.  Occasionally I get a reminder of the man I married, but most of the time it's like coping with a stranger who has invaded my life and home.  I also get the ""counseling"" advice, but quite honestly, I get tired of that as the immediate answer/solution.  All the counseling in the world isn't going to change my situation, and unless the counselor has first hand experience with caregiving for a loved one, I can guarantee they have no idea what life is like for us.  Hope you feel better soon.  Wish I had some great advice and solutions to offer, but unfortunately there are no easy answers.
That is one of the cruelest parts of dementia- we lose our loved one bit by bit - of course you miss conversations of all kinds with your beloved. His frustration at having communication difficulties is valid and relatable. 

When navigating my late Dad’s diagnosis through his death, I found the Alzheimer’s Association (AA) to be an incredible resource. One of the most valuable tools AA has provided is support groups which I’ve regularly attended as caregiver, and my Dad - and sadly now, Mum
- found camaraderie in the patient support groups. 

Sorry you are having a rough time this morning. Try to do something kind for yourself, even if it is as simple as a cup of your favorite tea.
I'm so sorry. My mom has dementia and sometimes I think it's the hardest thing we'll ever go through, but I think it would be even more difficult if it was my partner. Do you have any counseling options available?
I don't have any words, except to tell you that you're not alone, and you have every right in the world to feel everything all at once, and to be overwhelmed by it sometimes, like a normal f***ing human being. Keep the love in your heart, and keep laughing.
I still get my dad to laugh at least half the day... but even that is slipping away. He just wants to sleep all day and i have to physically carry him around now. Music and laughter are the best thing you can do. 
 It's better to laugh and sing about the end than cry about it, from what i can tell.
Such a tough part of the journey. Nearly 2 years ago we launched https://goodwinhouse.org/stronger-memory/ and couples found that writing down their thoughts sometimes helped when words were hard to find. Hope this might support you and others on your path.
I am really sorry for you and your husband. It’s such a slow motion, never ending loss of all the million things that made up your relationship, and conversation is maybe the biggest. Wife and I have been married 16 years and it’s been probably 5 since she could carry on a conversation, then it was a handful of long term memories she liked to talk about, then a small set of references to people and events that engaged her, now very little at all, a few phrases that she responds to and sometimes excitedly repeats. Music seems to engage her so we sing a bit (despite me being a terrible singer!) I carry all the history and context of our relationship but she remembers virtually nothing about us at this point. Hard and so strange. And for me, like you, incredibly isolating and lonely much of the time. It is taking a lot of time and effort but building friendships and getting time outside the home is helping me some. I feel some guilt when out doing things but know I need it to be healthy and functional enough to keep taking care of her and our teen kids and working. I wish you and your husband peace and comfort and gently encourage you to seek conversation with friends if you don’t have that now. There is no replacement for the conversations you had with your husband but hopefully you can find ways to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness. Take care of yourself.
All of you going through this with husbands, I feel you. And see my future in what you're saying. As awful as it is to watch a parent or grandparent decline, it's different when it's your spouse, your life partner, best friend. I'm about 3-4 years into the journey, since the first little odd ""wtf"" moments  stated showing up, few and far between. Now they're getting more frequent and it's undeniable what's happening, I think even to my husband. Altho he's still not quite ready to acknowledge it fully. This is not the future we ever envisioned for ourselves. Yet here we are. I hope all of you stay strong and take care of yourselves.
I am sorry and cannot imagine caring for your spouse after decades of marriage. My heart goes out to you all.

We took care of our dad for 2 1/2 years in his home. I would try to get him to talk about my mother, work, church anything, before he quit talking. I didn't care what he said, I would agree and keep asking questions, until he went silent. We had our laptops to keep ourselves company when he slept. We cherished the few minutes whenever he was ""present""
My hubs was just diagnosed a month ago. Very beginning. But I've been seeing this for a few years. He just can't grasp or following a story. I have to break it into small parts, pause, then continue. He still has to ask me what I just said. His brain doesn't work very quickly anymore.
So sorry you are going through this. My mother is at this stage and I live on the opposite side of the state so we have frequent phone calls. But they are getting shorter and shorter. I can tell she gets frustrated not being able to say meaningful sentences other than saying how much she loves me. My dad was her primary caregiver until he passed away 9 months ago. They were married almost 72 years. I am thankful he didn’t see her at this stage. She could still talk very well, but was starting to say the wrong word occasionally before he died. Now she can’t remember he died and has stopped asking where he is. 

Have you looked into finding local support groups for dementia caregivers or families? I think the Alzheimer’s Association website has a list of support groups by state if you are in the US.
You're not alone. My wife has had dementia for years. I've sadly given up on any meaningful conversation with her.
I feel fit you snd know only too well about this. My wife is on this road, starting about five years ago. But as many of you know, she refuses to see a dr for anything, so no diagnosis. 

Yes, no real conversations, and seems we haven’t for so long. And she’s so sensitive and can get so angry at the drop of a hat. It’s exhausting. Sometimes I go through old photos on my iPhone, reminding me of who she was. 

But she does want me to be with her nearly constantly. The result are long periods of boredom punctuated by big fighting times that I rarely succeed in avoiding. 

Just exhausting.
I'm 71, my wife, 76.  We'll be married 27 years in May.  Diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment last summer but her memory and cognitive function have drastically declined since then.  Dementia runs in her family.  Three sisters, two aunts, two cousins.  Also, a difficult, dysfunctional marriage.  She was never diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder but it was years of explosive rage, anger and extreme moodiness.  One therapist told me that there's something seriously wrong with her.   Her surviving sister, with advanced dementia, also was controlling, manipulative and urged her husband to kill himself after he lost his job.  He did kill himself.  

 I relapsed into untreatable bipolar illness in 2005 and went on disability in 2011, so the past 17 years have been a disaster, for me, my wife, for our marriage, but now with my wife descending into dementia, I'm scared for my mental and physical health.  I know it's going to get worse for my wife and I've been trying to hold onto to my life.  She also has poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes, eats very little, doesn't drink water but has her nightly glass of wine(also a high functioning alcoholic.  Runs in her family, too).  I'm almost expecting that she'll die from her poor physical health before she dies from the complications of dementia.  I stay with her more out of loyalty, than love.  Despite the emotional damage I've experienced from being in a co-dependent, abusive marriage, the empath aspect of me drives my 'responsibility' to take care of her as long as I can...if it doesn't kill me.",2022-03-05 09:39:14,jadesisto,t7asjb
Dementia,I can take this,"I feel like running away and never coming back. As you have seen by my other posts my dad was diagnosed with Dementia..my mom has not processed the diagnosis years later and believes my dad does not have dimentia. She gets angry if my dad does not listen to her, falls or hurts himself..i know he cannot help himself but my mom thinks he can. She complains about everything she even complains that my dad does not say thank you anymore when she does things for him...she fights about things with him that happend in the past how he worked himself into this state how he smoked himself into this state..she gets into a full rage mode when he falls or wets himself...i dont know what to do anymore..","I’m sorry that you’re in this situation. Under HIPAA laws, if you’re not authorized, you can’t receive information from your father’s doctors. However you can absolutely provide information and perhaps ask that a social worker become involved. 

It’s very difficult for a spouse to accept the fact that their long-term partner has changed. Your mom needs a support group for caregivers. There are even ones on FB and many IRL. I attend one for Lewy Body Dementia and it helps tremendously. It is here where spouses often state how difficult it is to accept their partner as a different person than they married. 

What your mother is doing isn’t right. It’s quite frankly, abusive. I hesitated to make that statement. In the US, you can get the state authorities involved but obviously that’s going nuclear. 

Is there any way that you can get someone to provide your mom a few days of respite care?  What about educational resources? What if you and your mom go to your father’s doctor and he/she explains the situation to your mom, after you have previously provided the aforementioned information to your dad’s doctor?
Sounds like your Mom is afraid. Some people try to overcome/control what they are afraid of by turning into a bit of a drill instructor. It can help some as long as everyone knows that's the plan*. But if she's in denial, it sounds (to me) like she is just terrified and doesn't want to accept this reality. And who would? This stuff really sucks. 

I'm sorry this is happening to your family, OP. Maybe a dr or new dr could help?
How much help does she get with the day to day caregiving?  This is where I would focus my energies.
You need to get him some home care help. It is too hard to both do the pragmatic caregiving for his daily hygiene tasks AND do the emotional processing of the impending loss of her life partner at the same time.

For understanding this, it may help if you show her a video about how the disease actually works. She needs to see a picture of a diseased brain. To understand that it's not something he can will himself out of. It is not him personally insulting or disrespecting her or laziness, it is BRAIN DAMAGE.",2022-03-05 08:38:13,StudentTeacher278,t79mmc
Dementia,Is my father developing dementia?,"Today I (21F) received a very odd call from my father (68M). We live in different cities and don't speak too often, but we're not on bad terms so to say.

He calls and says ""Auguri"" which in Italian is used for both birthdays and other celebrations. My birthday is on the 20th of April, and I know he knows this, so I was confused and asked..auguri for what? He sounds convinced when he says it's for my birthday. At this point I'm weirded out so I said it's not my birthday today dad, which prompts him to ask me what day it is today. I answer it's the 5th of March and he goes oh it was yesterday wasn't it? I tell him no and remind him my birthday is on the 20th of April, but he seems confused by that answer, though he brushed it off and ended the call.  


Now this isn't the first time in recent months, or perhaps even a couple of years, that I've noticed he seems to be a bit.. off. As said I don't interact often with him but last time he would ask me the same questions repeatedly, things about my job I'd answered a thousand times, but to be honest I attributed it more to lack on interest on his side than age starting to get to him.   


This birthday thing though was very odd. He knows my birthday is on the 20th of April, it's a date easy to remember, he calls every year or sends me a message, after 21 years of not mistaking it how would you confuse it with the 5th of March? It's not even another family member's birthday, and I don't have siblings or anything. This left me thinking because his mother (my grandma), whom we lived with for a couple of years before she passed away suffered from a mild form of dementia and she would also be very confused throughout the day or not really recognize us sometimes. 

Do you think this whole thing could be a red flag? He lives alone in another town, doesn't really have any other family, and my mom wants nothing to do with him (for good reasons). I don't know if I should worry or not.","Yes, that's worrisome. I would def want to get him tested because you can slow things down early on.
Yes.  Red flag for sure.  Start watching his bills and finances.  Those are some of the first to be affected by the reasoning skills and dementia deterioration.  Definitely see if he’ll see a doctor about it and start talking now about power of attorney and future plans for when /if a guardianship is necessary.  Also note some dementia symptoms are also caused by UTIs in older people.  So definitely get a doctor involved.  

Make plans!!!!  

We have guardianship of my FIL and they never planned for dementia.  Everything else but not dementia.  He now thinks we stole everything just because we had to secure things and put his money in guardianship accounts.  He is easily scammed and homecare is now in the home.  We are in a similar situation where we are his closest family but still 2.5 hrs away and he lives in the middle of the country.  

Make plans! Get the ball rolling now if it is truly dementia.
He might be missing appointments also. Time confusion was my first indication something was happening with my Dad.
Sigh.  This is concerning.  Does he have anyone in his life on a daily basis that you could confer with?    This is a tough journey  ☹️

BTW, my birthday is also 4/20.",2022-03-05 06:58:32,blacksssad,t77zuh
Dementia,He’s gone,"It has been almost 10 years since the first diagnosis. My mom has been so strong for so long and found my dad the best treatment, I don’t know how she did it. He was the best dad and a great husband. Even until the end he was so happy and would belly laugh if you talked to him in a British accent. 

Tonight he has moved on. The whole family came up to be with him earlier today. He had developed pneumonia and an infection in his lungs. He wasn’t conscious but we talked to him anyways. We told him that he was loved and some of our favorite memories together. We didn’t know he would be gone so soon but turns out it was the perfect closure for us. 

It was peaceful. His breathing changed. My mom held his hand and said he could rest, he didn’t have to fight anymore and he could let go. One breath, two, then he was gone. 

I love my dad. My little boy will never really know how wonderful a man he was, but we will be sure to pass on his love. Love you dad. Rest well.","To be surrounded with love as he took his final breath, so beautiful and wonderful for him.  You and your family were so lucky to have such a man to share in your lives.  You have a lifetime of memories to share with your son and he will know, through you, what a wonderful man he was.  Peace.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
I'm very sorry for your loss. I'm glad for all of you that it was so peaceful and that your whole family spent time with him. It's good that you spoke to him. xx
Continued peace to you and your family.",2022-03-05 02:38:56,auniehale,t74dvb
Dementia,Early stages,"My dad is 76 years old. He worked a very involved job until 2 years ago. His hours were reduced but then cut. He lives with my mother 3 hours from me. Once the work slowed down, all of his behavior started to rapidly deteriorate. Little things at first, showing us the same photos, telling the same stories. My mom doesn't drive and during COVID relied on him going to the store for essentials. He used this as an escape. My mother isn't easy to deal with, she does nag and harp on things and I think at first we felt sympathy for him as this was the first time in 40 years he didn't have an escape. But then it started. First it was online ""get rich quick"" click bait and compromising their accounts. Then it was believing ever spam email or junk mail as a collection. My mom tried to explain its not real, he would go behind her back. She hid their credit cards after having a few cards and bank accounts compromised.  I bought him a wood burning kit to try keeping him busy. He tried to make it a business. Now he is not wanting to pay taxes on it so he's just giving it all away despite the cost they are putting in for materials. He does a lot in secret. He also is in a purge phase. If he feels they don't use it, he either gives it away or throws it away. He's been taking items out of the church boxes with non perishable goods (the boxes like the book boxes in front of churches) to neighbors as gifts but telling them ""its from the poor people box"". The neighbors are starting to think hes the weird old neighbor.  My mother is having a hard time trying to keep him in line. He side swiped someone and claimed they hit him and it was a hit and run. I am trying to get resources for her. My brothers are local to them but one has gone no contact from all the craziness and his own mental health issues and my other brother is about to go through a divorce.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? My mom is almost feeling like she is being gaslit. He has always had a photographic memory and testing with the MD is confirming a decline but he remembers all the images or phrases in testing for mental decline.","Read about frontotemporal dementia. Sounds like my dad when he first started going downhill. The memory was not the first thing to go. He had a radical change in his behavior and the memory problems didn't come for a few years after that.
All of this sounds so much like my mom. She has Alzheimer’s but there’s signs of other dementia as well. 
Get your paperwork (POAs, medical plans, etc) in line now. I’m sorry this is happening- it’s such a horrible thing.
Sounds like my dad, he’s also 76. He is constantly falling for spam and schemes, repeating questions, etc. Has a hard time working cards and forgets to pay sometimes, mom took his cards away. He has early dementia. But he could not remember the test phrases or images, but could draw the clock. Some times he seems totally “normal”, and sometimes he’ll do something weird- lately he’s been thinking he’s really poor, (like dirt-poor poverty like he was when he was a kid) and he’ll think he and my mom won’t be able to afford small things and he’ll worry, and she has to reassure him and show him how much money is in his bank account. And he falls for the “We’ve been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty…” call every. time. 

I also recently bought him a wood burning kit lol. No mention of starting up a side hustle yet though!
Sounds similar to my MIL. The early signs were there but she passed all the tests. A year later she ended up being diagnosed.",2022-03-04 23:16:49,XeyeCeweX,t718ps
Dementia,"First time poster, long time caregiver","Hello! I'm new here but a brief back history; I have been a caregiver for one family member or another since 2010 when my stepdad had the wrong kidney removed at an incompetent hospital, which led to kidney stones in his good kidney, which led to gall stones, which led to gall bladder then bladder cancer which progressed to bone then brain cancer. I changed his colostomy bags, took him to the doctor, stayed at the hospital with him while my stepmother getting my six year old (at the time) sister to get new hump buddy's house and stressed dating this guy while my dad was still alive in the hospital! I hate her needless to say. My stepdad pissed 11/25/2011.

Fast forward to 2012 and I get a new job in Chicago, where my little brother lives, and a couple of weeks into living in Chicago I meet my now husband. Eventually I move in with him, which is difficult because he lives in the family home to help care for his stepfather, who has lost his left leg. Fast forward to 2014 and stepfather starts showing signs of dementia, but not just any kind. Lewy Bodies. He hallucinates all the time. Snakes in his room, angels in the trees, people hiding in my note mother-in-law's room. We had to hide the knives even. Eventually he just deteriorates and hospice has to come in and he passed 5/27/2015.

In 2016, my husband and I officially marry, but this is the year his mother-in-law starts showing signs of dementia as well. She has frontal lobe dementia and she is quite the chore for us. She can't remember anything more than five minutes. She can't control her urine or bowel movements. She's a fall risk who refused to use her walker unless we yell at her. She doesn't do anything ask day long. She'll nap and watch TV. I can't get her interested in anything else. She used to play her tablet. Not anymore. She treats me like a maid and calls me by the wrong name over half the time. I love her very much. I lost my parents when I was young and I had a great relationship with my mother-in-law. She was a best friend. Now she's like a shell of that lady. 

Sorry for the book, I am writer. Thanks for reading. Just wanted to let you know what you are in for!","Reading this while trying to get my dad back in bed after he got up at 4 am to take a shower. The aide will be here at 7:30. So we are drinking hot chocolate and listening to 60s music with the lyrics showing on the 
tv and dad is singing really really badly. I know it’s the calm before the storm. My grandma had dementia so I have a little experience with it but boy this is a tough journey. Many blessings to you for your wonderful care of your loved ones.",2022-03-04 22:12:38,persephoneReborn27,t704p1
Dementia,A fondly remembered moment,"Just remembered an incident that happened nearly 40 years ago that still makes me laugh - not to mention proud... This took place during the mid-80s, when my Granda was well on the way to full-blown dementia. Must have been Christmas, bc there were other (no longer local) family members at his house this particular night, and we were watching what I think must have been Minder on The Orient Express (a British comedy drama about low-level criminals).

The first laugh happened when a scene started with the train coming towards you, 'out of the screen'. My Granda shouted 'whoa!' or something and moved his cup of tea that was on the floor in front of him out of the way. I mean, it could happen to any of us, right? And a similar shot caused panic at the birth of cinema, IIRC, so nothing to be ashamed of.

But the big one came a few minutes later. The lead character/hero Terry was walking down a narrow corridor on the train when some giant goon starts walking towards him from the opposite direction. Terry stops, turns round and starts to walk back but his path is blocked by another giant goon, and the pair of them start to close in on him menacingly. All of a sudden my Granda leaps up (he'd pretty much stopped walking several months earlier so this was no mean feat), grabs the poker from the hearth and starts heading for the TV with it raised above his head. It took three of us to get the poker off him and get him sat back down...

I mean, yes, it's incredibly sad, and slightly scary to the young teen I was, but damn, I have never been more proud of the old fella than I was at that moment...

And with that, time for bed. All the best...","I visited my Mom's sister at the Alzheimer's lock up on the way to my dad's house.

Aunt had NO idea who I was so I just told her I was a friend and stopped in to say Hi on my way to see Bill(dad).

At the mention of his name Aunt perked up and said

""Bill?! He's a real JERK!"" and retreated back to lala land.

WELL. She couldn't have been more correct. It was great to get some validation no matter how fleeting.
Lol I love it. He’ll give ‘em the what-for!

It’s like how moms will have a rush of adrenaline and be able to lift a car if their baby is trapped… good to know granda could’ve still defended himself then, even though it was just a drill…",2022-03-04 20:52:47,,t6yori
Dementia,"MRI results yesterday; yup, it's dementia","My lovely partner of nearly 25 years has been treated under an ever-changing kaleidoscope of mental health diagnoses (and drugs to match) for years. I've been asking for a dementia screening for about 3 years (been seeing stuff 10 years), and was brushed off repeatedly.

Finally it got obvious enough that a recent crisis hospitalization and a fresh set of eyes burped out a referral to a neurologist. Consult, MRI, and results from MRI in doctor-ese, to be discussed at a followup visit. (I'm grateful they posted results so quickly, didn't make us wait a month for the followup, though only the headline is intelligible to me.)

On the one hand, devastating news. On the other, was pretty sure what results would be. One hell is behind us; a fresh hell has opened its maw before us. At least now the beast has stepped out of the shrubbery and shadows, and we know what **won't** work so we can stop wasting our time. 

Thanks for listening. I've been hanging out on this sub in anticipation for a few months, and y'all are helping me stay calm and carry on.","A crappy diagnosis is still a diagnosis. It’s a weird feeling to be thankful for a dementia diagnosis but at least you know what you’re facing. My mother’s Dr said for 10 years that she was faking. Finally got a diagnosis a year ago and I was so relieved
I’m so sorry hon.
Give your self some transition time, even when the diagnosis is all but spoken, it is still difficult.
 and make time to take care of your self. Put that in place now, if you don’t already have it. You will need that space.


I suspect my own spouse has issues, for many reasons, and when I described them to friends( several of who have had same thing) and to my therapist, they agree with me.

So on the one hand, my hope that he was ever going to step up from taking any of the burden of ( gestures around) being adult in the world off me, is dead. But then I can stop putting energy into wishing he ever will.
That's exactly how I felt. It was terrible to hear the doctor tell my mother she has dementia but I was also so relieved to finally understand what the heck was going on with her. At least with a diagnosis you have a better idea of how to proceed with care.
I was relieved when we finally got my mom’s diagnosis. I know now we have the diagnosis as a way to get her some help, and for her to understand some of her limitations. “Missing a step” was an excuse we used for a long time but now we have a real life diagnosis to blame.
It's a rocky road but now you have that diagnosis so appropriate medication can be used. I switched docs three times before I found one who would actually listen. Now we are on our 4th doc and the diagnosis was changed, didn't matter though, still dementia with the added diagnosis of Parkinson's.  Keep strong and continue to advocate for your loved one.
Get right on the Donepezil and memantine. Like, right on it. Those medicines make a tremendous difference.
So very sorry; but also, welcome to the club. Now that you have a specific word, you can learn about the condition, and how to create an environment and medication regime that slows the progression, or at least limit the unnecessary pain and suffering in your lives. Remodeling your home to be fully accessible, or moving to a walkable neighborhood so that driving isn’t a necessity to leave the house. Setting things up to prevent severe sundowning. Arranging your finances so that your partner qualifies for Medicaid so that you can get home care and put them in a nursing home without plunging you into poverty (if USA)
I get it. I suspected dementia for a couple years before we actually got the diagnosis. I had to push so hard for him to go back to the neurologist, for him to see the clinical psychologist, etc. My husband would say “ you are just hoping something is wrong with me” and I would explain “ no. I KNOW something is wrong. I’m just hoping we find out what it is so we can deal with it”. 

Getting the diagnosis was exactly as you described: one kind of hell…the not knowing…was behind us. The new hell that is dementia was I front of us. But because I had thought it was possible for a couple years it almost felt like a relief to at least KNOW. We finally had a name for this thing causing upheaval and heartache.
It's an awful diagnosis but having a name to put to it somehow helps. I'm sorry.
I’m wondering what other diagnosis he has had. My SIL has been diagnosed with Bipolar, years ago. My hubby recently diagnosed with dementia, I’m seeing so many actions of both that are the exact same. Wondering if SIL could have dementia?
Hubs had an MRI late yesterday. Waiting for that baseline.....",2022-03-04 19:17:28,108beads,t6wx34
Dementia,At a tough crossroads: Assisted Living,"My mother (79) has vascular dementia. While she can hold a conversation; she can’t bath herself; and she can’t find the bathroom in her own house (among other things). So she is middle/advanced. She actually has an incredible memory for things 30+ years ago… just can’t remember what happens 10 seconds ago. Anyway…. My father (81) is her main caregiver along with a lot of help from my sister and I. She also has a nurses aid 3 times a week for 4 hours each time. However, it is just becoming too much for my father. His health is declining rapidly. We found an incredible assisted living/memory facility that we thought would be a great solution. They would have their own 1 bedroom “apartment” and have some cool and clean for them. (I wanted to move in!) we took my mother there today for a tour. She looked like she was a having a good time; talking with the residents ; commented on how nice it is. Then when we walked out; she was like “this is a nursing home, no way I am going to live here!!!” It was heartbreaking to hear; but to be brutally honest, I did not expect her to walk out saying she loved the place. (Maybe Hope… but didn’t expect it). My father is excited about the place (they would BOTH be living there). I honestly want to this more for my fathers sake…. He can’t do this anymore. I know my mom is not of sound mind… and I fear we will be taking here there “kicking and screaming”. 

After typing all this.. I am not even sure I am looking for advice… as much as a place to vent. This is really tough ….","I've found that in making transitions, place the blame for the move on others outside of the family.   ""The doctor said so"".  ""The nurses said you need more care.""

As for the kicking and screaming part, I won't mince words.  Many of us found that when that day comes, it's a hard day.   In the case of my mom I had POA as did my sister and we planned EVERYTHING out, right down to what the movers would be bringing over to assisted living/memory care.  My mom was 84 and already had downsized four years earlier to a senior living community (semi assisted living- some meals, light housekeeping, add on services if needed).  

The bottom line is this- you have to consider everyone here, as you are. Your dad needs some relief.   Talk to him about privately about making the transition.   

Please know that a move can make dementia symptoms worse- it's not anything you did wrong or that the move was a mistake.  If more care is needed, it has to be done.  People do settle in- but it make take a month or six weeks.  It's best to do the move before lunch- because then there is a meal to be a welcome distraction and it's not later in the day which can add to confusion as it is close to sundowning time.

It is tough. You can do this.  It sounds like you found a good place, a safe and welcoming place.  Making the jump is not easy- so many things on a checklist with a move as there is.  

If you have any more questions or just need to vent, please do.   We are all sharing similar experiences, sadly.
So sorry to hear this but can understand where your are coming from.
When you say your dad will be living there as well is it as together? Not sure how this works tbh if they'd both move in it would probably be less of a heave for your mum.

Prayers and love with you xx
Hugs to you. And your father, mother, and sister. I can only imagine the strain and heartbreak you’re going through. Congratulations on finding a great assisted living facility; it sounds like a wonderful fit for both your mom and your dad. She’ll get the care she needs and your dad will get well-deserved relief. 
It’s true that your mother may be resistant during the initial move, but as you noted, her short-term memory is shot—perhaps that means that she’ll quickly forget any objections she had to moving there? 
Is she on any medication that can help stabilize her mood? It might be a good idea to consult with her doctor and see if there’s any medication she can be prescribed temporarily to better help with this transition, so she’s not “kicking and screaming”. 
Also, it’s okay to lie to her in situations like this. If her main aversion is to the notion of living in a “nursing home” then you can call it something else; whatever makes it more palatable for her. You’re not deceiving her malevolently; you’re using compassion to help her and your father into a safer and more sustainable situation. Best of luck to you, and keep us posted. 💗
ugh I'm going through this right now with my dad he REFUSES to move from his apt or even entertain the idea. We just got the call today from a transition nurse that living on his own is no longer a safe option 😑 I am NOT looking forward to the day he has to move as no amount of talking or reasoning will make it easier. I am fully expecting to have to lie to him to get him over to my place and tell him there that he isn't going back home 😢.
My grandmother is 72 with dementia and while she can still physically do for herself someday her mind just won't cooperate to do so. We've gone the route of home health care professional
I’m right there with you.  We had hoped to care for my dad at home for as long as he was cognizant of where he was and who we are (he lives with sister in a house I own, several blocks from my home).  At a minimum, we wanted to preserve his small nest egg for as long as possible.  But, the time has come.  While he is still somewhat cognizant of those of us he sees daily, he is having more and more problems communicating (can’t really carry on conversation anymore), dressing himself, feeding himself appropriately (e.g., trying to cut steak with a spoon), bathroom habits, hasn’t showered in months, etc.  He can barely stand it when my sister leaves, even just to go to the store.  She and her husband both WFH, but he disrupts constantly.  He wants to eat constantly, seemingly forgetting that he just ate minutes before (although he continues to lose weight).  We’ve tried having someone come in  but he would have nothing to do with it.  Long story short, we’ve decided the time as come to seek a memory care facility for him.  We have found a couple that we like, although both are very expensive.  To make it more complicated, he has a large dog that he cannot be separated from, so we’ve had to look for places that would permit him to have a dog.  We have found a place that is very nice, brand new so everything is so clean and fresh.  Only 12 residents at present, although eventually they aim to have 88.  His money would last him 5 years there.  Who knows, but it is hard to imagine that he will last 5 more years. 

So very soon now, we are going to face moving him.  He will definitely be distraught and probably angry, confused, mean, aggressive, tearful and every other negative emotion you can think of.  My sister and I are tied in knots emotionally at the thought of having to place him somewhere involuntarily.  He has never lived in any kind of congregant setting.  He went from his mom’s house, to his wife’s house to his daughters’ houses.  But he is also miserable and mainly just sits in a rocker or on the couch staring into space, until he decides he’s hungry and/or wants my sister’s attention (about every 30-60 minutes). We are hoping that after the initial shock, he will settle in and maybe even enjoy his life a little bit.  He’s clearly bored and unstimulated so being somewhere where there are activities, music, peers, etc. might ultimately be pleasing to him.  But we know it is going to be hellish in the beginning.  

Best of luck.  You are doing the right thing.",2022-03-04 18:29:38,Bonatom01,t6vyrc
Dementia,I think the Drs are wrong.,"My dad is an alcoholic. He quit cold turkey a week before intake. A week later he had a seizure. Once admitted, it was discovered that he had a kidney infection. However, I discussed his previous alcoholic habits and abstinence periods. I expressed my opinion about korakoff syndrome. It's something that was discussed amongst my father's doctors and me. 

He legitimately does have confusion. But... When he's been on Ativan he's unpredictable. It's like he regressed by days. He only took a downturn after the treatment for alcohol withdrawals.

I have talked to his medical care teams: doctors, residents, nurses, specialists, hospitalists (I have some fucking beef with hospitalist!!! I know you're not all the same, but WTF are you learning to be such an uncaring sect of the field??), etc. 

We discussed stopping his Ativan treatment a week ago. He made great steps towards recovery. Lucid, could carry on conversations, remembering tons of things (I've been trying to keep his mind ""active"") cooperating, etc. 70% of normal. Including playing tricks on me.

No body agrees about his situation. They're all cagey about recovery (I get it, you cannot even hint at a promise of results). I (maybe irrationally) see improvement towards his normal self. The reintroduction of Ativan has halted and reversed his progress after recovery. 

I'm most likely in denial. Give it to me straight with how I'm wrong and what my expectations should be? Everyone seems to think I'm wrong, but they don't know my dad and seem to be covering their own ass. I'd like to have opinions from those in a likely similar situation.","My father is a former alcoholic and hasn't drank in over a year and isnt on any other meds. He's still losing his memory, not to say you can't hold out some hope that maybe him getting sober might make a difference but the brain is a complex and often misunderstood organ. Some days my dad seems great! happy, joking, having great conversation and other days he doesn't get out of bed, sounds confused and is almost mute. He has good days and I get hopeful and then the bad days bring me back down to the reality of the situation 😒 It's an awful fucking roller coaster ride and it's only going to get worse for him. Give it more time of him being sober before you really get your hopes up....
Post to r/askdocs, may get a good take there

Benzos are generally a bad idea with people w dementia but idk if it’s called for with people weaning off alcohol 

For WK syndrome B1 I think can help
My Mom is an active alchohalic with dementia. The benzos seem to be the worse for her.  I can totally see the difference when she cuts down on the booze and benzos.",2022-03-04 16:23:46,originalhoney,t6tbnh
Dementia,"Explaining, yet again, is heartbreaking for mom and for me","My mom's in a good place, a sweet spot if you will, with her dementia. 

She's in assisted living, has friends, participates in classes and games, is ok with me managing her affairs, with only rare paranoia/suspicion cropping up. I know it won't be this good forever. 

She knows she has some level of impairment, blames it all on a concussion 3 years ago (even tho she has 2 types of dementia and the neurologist has told her otherwise). Every once in a while it becomes evident that she's not aware of how bad it will get, or that it's progressive, or maybe even that its actually dementia; she asks me if she will end up ""like one of those people"" referring to the memory care residents in her building. I try to gently explain (again) that it's progressive but we don't know how long. She then says ""oh"" and gets quiet. It's heartbreaking.

Are we at a point that I just stop explaining and be vague? Is there a point to ripping off the bandaid again and again? 

What did you do with your loved ones?

Thanks for any stories, encouragement, etc.","No need to explain it.  She truly won't understand.  It doesn't make her feel better.   By the time she's like ""one of those people"", she won't even know.  So give her a reassuring, ""No, Mom!  You're doing great, right?  What did you make in art class today?  What friends did you see today?""  Keep the moments you have with her, upbeat and positive.   I don't explain things to my Mom.  I agree with her that yes, it must be scary to forget things.  And I'm sorry her ""friends"" are mean when they hear the same story over and over again from her.  That's rude.  But today, she can tell me all the stories she wants.
I think it's healthy for *us* to understand as much as we can about dementia, that it's progressive and to be as prepared as we can be about what the future might hold. But I don't think it's helpful or necessary to explain this to our LO. 

My husband is very aware that he is progressing, but if he mentions it we reassure him and joke that his memory is better than ours and change the subject. We can't change what's happening, so why spoil the time he has by worrying about things beyond our control?
Definitely don't tell her. Keep her spirits lifted as long as you can.
The only time I have a frank discussion with my husband is if he’s endangering his safety. He’s a super high fall risk. He has done some crazy things like climb up on the bed to pull the ceiling fan chain, he fell off but fortunately landed on his feet. 

My husband really overestimates his capabilities, his memory, and his cognition. Most of the time, I don’t say anything. Even if I do, I don’t say it in a way that seems to upset him. He usually quickly forgets anyway.
""Mum, who knows - everybody's got to get old, some things gonna have to break down eh!""  Yeh, it's sad...
Ii tell my mom it's a day at a time, she's doing great for today and that's all that matters.
""You're not going to be one of them; you'll always be my mom!""
A little fibbing won't hurt. Just assure her that she's doing fine...
The current medical advice on this is that it IS officially ethical to lie to dementia patients, in situations where the truth will only upset them. Always redirect. 

When she's in the early stages it may be a good idea for her to know and to realize the gravity of it, to sign important legal documents and discuss serious things, her biggest and final wishes that she feels strongly about. Otherwise no. At best it just makes her sad. At worst, her paranoia can take over and she believes that when you tell her she has dementia, that you are trying to gaslight her. Then she won't trust you or enjoy the time spent with you.",2022-03-04 15:25:57,Call00hCallay,t6s2jz
Dementia,Two people lost to dementia,"Absolutely destroying me to write this. My dad aged 63 was diagnosed with dementia in 2015. After many struggles and no end of saying our goodbyes he passed on 26/12/2021. My heart broke, not just for me but for my daughter who is now 17. She lost one grandad in 2017 to cancer, then watched my dad deteriorate until he passed. Now she’s just lost her great grandma on her dads side to the same thing. It’s the cruellest thing to watch. She’s asked me to go to her great nannas funeral which I would have done of course, but it’s on my birthday. The first birthday without my dad and also my 40th. I don’t feel like I can. My first birthday without him can I really go to a funeral? Im torn, she’s lost so many people and I want to go support her, but mentally I’m not doing okay and I don’t think I can face it. I feel selfish for not wanting to go, but I know she has a lot of support from her dads side of the family. What do I do?","Oh my gosh, I am so sorry.  So, so sorry.  I'm dealing with my mom having some form of dementia (she would never go to the doc, so we don't know what kind, but she is in memory care) and my MIL who has Alzheimer's.  My poor daughter has lost both of her grandmothers.  I'm not sure what to tell you to do - I just wanted to let you know you're not alone.  I would definately be torn, too.
You’ll regret it if you don’t go to the funeral. Even if you break down emotionally, a funeral is one of the most socially acceptable places to do so.
Personally I would do my best to support my daughter and I would go.  While it would be hard you may find some comfort in being there for her and you will not have any regrets in the future.  While it is good she has support from one side of the family it seems clear it is your support she wants.  So sorry for all of your losses.",2022-03-04 14:06:10,Emotional-Union8460,t6qcqc
Dementia,Remote controlling TV for Dad in assisted living,"We just moved my Dad to assisted living this week , on Monday, and today is the first day i haven't cried about it so far. All of the hardships and emotions aside, I'm trying to find ways to make his life there easier. I did order one of those TV remotes that has 4 buttons on it to make it simpler, but I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for having full access of the TV remotely.

I read someone set up a raspberry pi and IR emitter or some other crazy setup, but I'm not really at the point of pursuing that if there's any other option. I'd like to be able to turn the TV on and off and access all TV menus (changing input) as well as opening youtube and bringing up videos for him remotely. Is there ANYthing even close to something like that in existence? He does not follow instructions very well so 'push the volume button' would be a struggle. Complicating things is the multiple remotes, so if i DO hook up a amazon fire stick, he's not going to know how to use the remote.

Just curious what strategies others might have had for helping a loved one remotely with a TV. He's definitely getting some more activities this week than he was at home, so it's not like i'm encouraging him to just sit in front of the TV for 12 hours, but if he wants to watch the news or a sporting event or some educational videos, I'd like to be able to make that happen for him","Check out Caavo …
I put my dad's controller on a copy machine and blew it up large, and then labeled the ones he needed to know.  Also, I have the same controller at home... if he has problems I can use my Alexa echo show and I can hold up my controller and point to the button he needs to push.  He has gotten much better at it.",2022-03-04 13:58:07,RoadblockBodyMassage,t6q5zg
Dementia,To any U.K. people…,To any U.K. people… big piss-taking culture in my family (like a lot of families I suppose). So much of it is misplaced since my dad’s diagnosis of mixed dementia. Uncle (mum’s brother - who has also just received dementia diagnosis) just made lighthearted comment about my dad getting a disabled badge for his car (that only my mother drives since his diagnosis - grey area with DVLA) and dad forgets or doesn’t believe his diagnosis so comments like this must feel like having his heart ripped out.

Dementia,"Started Grandma on Seroquel, any input? Stories? How it worked for your loved one?","My family and I just started Grandma on Seroquel , she is  in moderate stage of dementia. Getting close to end of middle stage. She is having increased sleeping problems, anxiety and depression and also real bad paranoia and delusions. We had her back in at specialist and they recommend Seroquel. They kinda labeled it as a wonder drug for this. They said it could have her sleep. Mood. And the paranoia delusional side. 

I was wondering if anyone has had there loved one on it and how did they respond?. Any side effects? Any positive outcomes? Things to watch for ? Just your story would be appreciated. Anything to help in this trying time.

Thank you","I have been taking Seroquel for many years for bipolar and it's been a wonder drug for me. Really helps with the obsessive intrusive thoughts and delusions and helps me sleep. But it is a heavy hitter drug and can really knock you out and zombify you if you take too much. Work closely with your doctor to adjust the dosage to take lowest amount that helps the symptoms. At first definitely get them in bed before they take it because it can knock you out fast. Major side effects I have had are excessive hunger and sleepiness, which can be good in the elderly as it's a struggle to get them to eat and sleep enough. I'd definitly give it a try and take some time to dial in the dosage and give it a trail run.
My late mom was on it at the early stage and it was a disaster.  But I think she was on too high of a dose. Second go around, a couple years later at a lower dose was better.  

A friend of mine is convinced it accelerated his mom’s death.  But who knows about that? Every patient is different and from what I’ve seen, it works for most, especially for sleeping through the night. 

If you decide to go that route have the doc Rx a low dose at first and then if no side effects they can gradually increase if needed.
My uncle started on 50mg of Seroquel to help alleviate some sundowning symptoms and to help him sleep a bit. It made some difference but now he has recently been upped to 100mg of the meds so I'm hopeful it will work better. I hope your mom adjusts well to the medication.
My dad is in a memory care center, in late middle stage.  Dad has always been a peaceful person, but apparently he had started to become aggressive toward other patients and had some violent outbursts.  He was put on Seroquel, I'm not sure of the dosage.  It has definitely helped him overall, but it has also made him much more tired. He needs naps in the morning and afternoon now - and, I believe, still sleeps through the night.  He is generally in good spirits (seems less agitated) and still recognizes me and Mom.  I'm so sorry for what you are going through with your Grandma - I know how hard this is.  Sending positive thoughts and hoping for the best for your Grandma.
My late mom was on seroquel. Not sure of the dose but it made a world of difference. She was raised as a pastors daughter and was very quiet, calm and passive. She became so violent, trying to whack my dad in the head because she didn't know who I was. Broke make things, household items, her own finger and my dads finger as well. Seriously definitely calmed her down a lot. She also would nap often and definitely seemed in a daze sometimes. She also was battling undiagnosed breast cancer and we believe that between dementia and cancer it sped up her death. 

I hope it's helpful for your grandma. It's such a hard thing to deal with. And seeing someone so sweet and peaceful become so violent and mean is just that much harder.
My husband takes 25 mg of Seroquel at night. It really helps him sleep. I don’t notice any negative effects. 

One person in my Lewy Body Support group, their spouse is on 200 mg and it helped at first with her hallucinations but it’s not helping now. 

Nuplazid is a newer drug to treat delusions and hallucinations in LBD, it might be used off-label for other dementias. However, it’s unlikely they would start her on it before trying Seroquel.
Seroquel often has to be titrated (i.e. dose adjustments lower or higher) based on how it is working (or not).  [https://www.rxlist.com/seroquel-side-effects-drug-center.htm](https://www.rxlist.com/seroquel-side-effects-drug-center.htm) for side effects.
Hard to know what effect it’s having at this point, but we started it to ease agitation and promote better sleep and both are much better than they were. Has been on it for at least a couple of years. I do think it makes her a bit foggy, especially when she wakes up in the morning. She’s on other meds so again, hard to isolate what’s doing what. Good luck.
My wife was on it and had very bad muscle tightness/spasm in her neck area.  Also made her very low energy with very low blood pressure.Replaced it with Resperidone which seemed to work better for her.
My sister is on seroquel for combativeness.  It’s been effective but the dosage is tricky.  She started with too much and made her completely lethargic.  She’s at a point now where it just takes the rough edge off.  Took about a year to get the dosage just right.
One of my kids was on Seroquel for a short time and it caused drooling, lethargy, and incontinence.  I'm not saying it would have that effect on an adult, but if your Grandma suddenly exhibits any of those things, don't chalk them up to the dementia without considering whether it's a side effect of the drug.
Yes. Before we started my grandmother on Seroquel, she went from severe sundowning episodes (roaming around ""this isn't my house"" ""where am I"" ""take me home"" ""where is my real daughter"" and extremely panicked, distressed, and upset) 3-4 times a week. It was hell.

Within a few days of Seroquel, she was already MUCH better, the severe sundowning was only a few times a month. Dare I say, almost mellow. In a good way. Give it to her around 3 pm, or a couple of hours before she usually starts getting panicked and upset. Maybe keep a little journal to jot down how she does, any significant events of each day.",2022-03-04 08:29:06,BarefootGOON,t6izie
Dementia,Dementia strikes again,"I’ve posted and commented before about my mother with advanced dementia and the sad ride that’s been but this post isn’t about her. It’s my MIL.

My husband’s father passed last summer (95, COPD) rather suddenly. Fortunately DH (dear husband) was able to be there the last two weeks of his life. Unfortunately they live 1700 miles away and with covid we hadn’t visited for 2 years. We didn’t realize how much his dad had slowed down and things were in great disarray when DH arrived; unpaid bills, no home maintenance done, etc. 

So DH spent 3 months back there getting things in order for his stepmother. Fast forward to now, 7 months later and we are both visiting, following up on previous action items that she did nothing on and to do her taxes. Been here 3 days and it’s apparent she has pretty advanced dementia. I’d put her about 1-2 years behind my mother in progression.

I feel like I’ve been smacked in the head with a bag of bricks. And I’m not looking forward to the sh!t that’s sure to be coming, this is going to be even tougher because of the distance involved.

No way she will agree to move out west so we can better help her, she’s already too far gone to comprehend the impact her disease will have on us. 

She forgets everything, repeats things incessantly and has already been scammed out of $2000. I’m sure there is more of that to come. DH is already Medical POA, has access to all her accounts online and is co-owner of her bank account.

She’s 88 & has a brother in the area but he is older and not much help.

We’re going to the gym at her church tomorrow and I think I’ll slip off to ask what assistance they can offer. I’ll also give the local agency on aging a call.

This is so depressing. 

BTW, she’s in Louisville, KY if anybody knows of any good resources here.","i would consult with an elder care lawyer; if you have medical POA then you might be able to essentially force the move, which sucks but it is what it is given that she is no longer able to care for herself or be left alone....
Eh, be careful who all you tell that's she's not well and by herself and you are a long way away....sometimes attempts to illicit sympathy and help is just blood in the water to draw sharks. The advice from other posters here is good. Rally the professionals. They have responsibility and accountability. Use your spidey senses about the church etc....if they seem more curious than accountably helpful, I'd say no more and walk off. 

Trying to keep jerks from ripping off the elderly is a full time job, esp.when they know the person is out-of-it and alone. 

I'd also visit a few facilities while you are in town if you can. Just check em out, you know?

Best to you and your family, OP.
Thanks for all the suggestions - so far we've added alerts to her checking account, signed up for USPS mail alerts to our emails, and got a list of her doctors. Tomorrow I'm calling Area Agency on Aging, setting up spam blocking on her email and phone.  Need to start a list and just work thru it.",2022-03-04 06:15:48,gmmiller,t6gqi8
Dementia,Dementia ward improvements,"I’m a HCA on a Healthcare for Older People (geriatric ward) in a hospital in the UK. I’d say around 75% of our patients have dementia at any one time. Generally patients will stay for up to 2-3 weeks on average until they’re better, though currently around 1/3 of our patients have been with us for a couple of months - the wait for residential home placement is terrible.

A hospital isn’t an ideal environment for a dementia patient, this we all know. I want to help make our ward more dementia friendly, and I’m on the search for suggestions big or small.

We don’t have a day room - just male/female bays with bed spaces in . Did you find a day room, (somewhere less clinical with soft chairs and a TV etc) was helpful for your relative? I feel for our patients, they have nowhere to go but sit by their beds or pace in the corridors all day. I can’t help but feel it doesn’t help with the agitation they experience. I want to know if it’s something truly helpful as I’ll need to put the idea to our Matron and fundraise like crazy as the hospital have said they will not fund it.

Any other suggestions of things that helped during admission? A side note - I love this sub, it has been invaluable to see dementia from a relatives perspective. Love to you all x","They have a tv/sitting room where my father is. They usually play older movies. My Dad isn't interested as he can't really follow what is going on so he usually just walks around. Some of the ladies are content to hold dolls or stuffed animals. They have a couple birds in a cage that moves around the facility. I'm allowed to take my dog in and everyone loves that. I know everyone is different. My Dad feels a need to be doing something active but only seems to live in 5 minute periods. He may walk up and down the hall but he says he is very happy and each time he passes somebody it's a new interaction.
This paper has a number of ideas, and they seem reasonably simple. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6465876/
Years ago I noticed that the sofa in the rehab facility was full all of the time. The little ladies would sit and hold hands and listen to music or story telling together. Story tellers who were actor types and could act out short stories and had a couple of props/costumes were pretty popular.  They had a piano there too so music students would come in and play. I read years ago that music from one's late teens and early 20's can really put that someone in a good mood. I've since seen that to be true, including with myself. (Just fyi about the musical selections). 

Bless you and Thank You for doing what you do
I think a more realistic project would be trying to get (more?) volunteers to interact with the patients.",2022-03-04 03:51:51,pitseleh96,t6eqf1
Dementia,Tips for helping my grandma stay in bed?,"Hey guys, I'm currently living with my grandma with dementia. I would say mid stage. 

Every night around 8 I tell her to go to bed, take her to her room, watch her get in bed. She usually sleeps until 11. Then she get up and goes to the bathroom. After that she always wanders around the house talking for 1-2 hours. Then I have to remind her to go back to bed. Sometimes she will sleep the rest of the night, but usually she gets up and wanders around again. Any advice to help her stay in bed?

A little more info if anyone has any other advice: She doesn't remember who I am and doesn't understand everything I say. She can walk, but has back pain so I don't really take her out. She also doesn't remember to eat.

She should probably be in a home or something but my dad won't allow that. For the time being I am with her. Thanks for any advice.","This is a common challenge with dementia. There is no ""one size fits all"" solution and sometimes it can't be helped, but I've written some ideas that I've seen work below.

Have a consistent bed/wake-up time. Make sure she is getting physical **and mental** stimulation during the day. Make sure she's used the washroom beforehand (this may mean having her sit on the toilet for 10-15 minutes and prompting her to pee and poop. It may feel awkward but sometimes it's needed). Put a pressure alarm in her bed if you're worried about her getting up unaided. Ask her doctor about medications that may help her have a more restful sleep. Try to lower the lights and have her avoid TV, phones, etc, for at least an hour before bed. Find out if there was something she always did before or around bedtime that she doesn't do now (cup of tea, read a book, glass of wine, etc.) and find a way to recreate that. Try and have the hours before bed be as stress-free as possible, re-assure her that she's safe and everything is okay. 
           
I'm sorry your dad isn't ready for her to be moved to a long term care facility.    
Do you know if there's a place in your community that offers respite care? It can be a huge relief for caretakers and is an excellent way to ease someone in to a professional care environment.    
      
Wishing you the best and sending my love ♡
My dad would walk around his house, he would sundown really bad. He had to sleep on the sofa, he couldn’t sleep upstairs alone anymore. We did ask his doctor for a sleep aid, very low dose Ativan with an option to add an additional dose if needed. He slept and we slept. It’s a big ask for you to take care of her by yourself❤️
I wouldn’t be able to sleep through the night if I was going to bed as early as 8pm either. Have you tried having her go to bed later?
Get a hospital bed with railing & bumpers
You could put up a baby gate to block access to the rest of the house maybe.
Melatonin helps a lot. Both for bedtime along with herbal tea for a routine, and if she wakes up. I recommend gummy form so that she is inclined to actually take it. You could also play calming piano or guitar music etc the entire night in her room to calm her mind.
Bed alarms are a godsend and you can get rails for the bed if necessary.",2022-03-03 23:17:41,whyismylife_16,t6acxx
Dementia,"My father has Alcohol induced Dementia, refuses to move to a facilty and we are looking for options on how to handle him.","My siblings and I are dealing with an alcoholic father who now has dementia due to him being an alcoholic his whole life. He still lives alone and one of us is going there daily to check on him. He is refusing to go to an assisted living community. He has been prescribed meds for his memory and is refusing them too. Afraid if we make him move to a facility like that, he is going to cause problems and be asked to leave. Looking for any advise where we go from here.","You should know that Wernicke-Korsakoff - alcoholic dementia- is a special type of dementia in that in *some cases* it is reversible. Your Dad needs specialized treatment based on whether he is sober or not, and how thiamine deficient he is. Talk to his GP or a medical social worker with his insurance to make sure he receives proper treatment. 

A lot of variables in play here, wishing you the best.
Talk to a lawyer in your area so you can get legal control over him. The. You can make him go to a facility.
Sorry you are going through this. I too am scared of my uncle being to much to handle and being asked to come back home if we should get him in a place. I hope someone here can answer your question. All my sympathies to you for dealing with this awfulness.
contact adult protective services.
Caring for my parents had significantly increased my alcohol intake and what your dad is going through is my nightmare...thankfully I can control myself but I've definitely had ""one of those days"" more often than I'd like. It's honestly depressing to think that the only thing I can really do for myself these days is drink and work lol.

Sob story aside, try to determine if your dad has the reversible one or not, you may still be able to tell him, if that's  that's an option for you personally.",2022-03-03 13:59:43,MyracleTJ,t5yw09
Dementia,How do care facilities handle highly combative dementia patients?,Has anyone dealt with a loved one who was just way to aggressive to the point where even if you put your LO in a home the chances of them getting kicked out are very high. Any experiences or stories are welcomed. My uncle has vascular dementia and is on many medications to calm him but still he gets too out of hand that a care facility might not work and currently I'm his only option to live with.,"Just some advice from someone who has worked as a nurse aide for a bit over 20 years, MOST of that in nursing homes, and a few of those years in a memory care unit. 

First thing to try to de-escalate behaviors/combativeness when it starts, is to rule out ""needs"". Do they need to toilet or be changed? Are they hungry/thirsty? Are they too hot/cold? Are they bored or over stimulated? Is their clothes comfortable (not too tight, twisted, something poking/scratching them, etc)? If they cannot move/reposition themselves, when did you turn or reposition them last? Are they tired and need a nap. 

If all of those have been ruled out, next is addressing things that affect them because of their dementia. When you give care, are you doing it in a way that is not scaring them and letting them know what is going on? For example, don't just whip the covers off them when they're sleeping, start rolling them all around, and doing personal care. I don't have dementia, but if someone woke me up by ripping my blankets off, rolling me all around, and cleaning my private parts...I'd swing, too. Letting them know what you are about to do can reduce scares/surprises for them. ""Ok, I'm going to help you take your clothea off so you can get a shower"", ""I'm going to help you wipe, and this wipe might be cold"", ""I'm going to help you roll over so I can get these underwear (attends) under you"", etc. Also keep in mind that their reality is NOT the same as yours. Add in hearing/sight issues, it is easy for them to not be aware of everything going on, being scared, etc. 

I do not know your loved one's past...but trauma and PTSD can cause behavior issues. If you have someone who has experienced sexual abuse/rape...you suddenly start peeling off their clothes, removing their underwear, or cleaning private areas...even with their best intentions in mind...can trigger them. If you have someone who experienced war or violence...loud sounds, yelling, gun fire (even just from tv), certain body movements, etc...could potentially trigger them. 

Outside of those things, you can try to redirect. If they are bored, find them something to do. If they're over stimulated, letting them be left alone (with you at a safe distance to supervise) may be what they need. If they are ""handsy"" (trying to grab everything) during care, give them something soft to hold onto. 

That's what I have off the top of my head. I am currently tired, but may add more to this tomorrow. 

If all that fails, talk to their Dr. There are anxiety, depression, behavior, and anti-psychosis meds they could use to manage moods and behaviors...and do so without snowballing (medicating to the point of sleeping all the time or zombie like) them. 

I hope this helps.
Hi. I worked at a few LTCH’s and the best way to manage patients is with medications and keeping them distracted with activities.
My mom was in a fairly new care center that just opened a memory care unit. They told us they were fully trained and ready, but she was one of the first 4 patients. They drugged her nearly insensible for months. Based on some New York Times articles, this is pretty common. Eventually she moved to another care center that was an established dementia center. They weaned her off the drugs. Maybe her condition had advanced so that she was less combative. They definitely knew more about how to handle her. However she was much happier and did better there. She did continue on anti-anxiety meds which seemed to help.
My spouse told me of a mutiny on the floor the other day. Our parent had recently been moved to the level 2 memory care floor. A new resident was being moved in and she wanted no part of it. She was looking to escape and demanding directions out of there. She managed to get other residents up in arms. The staff did well, except for the new gal who chuckled at a resident threatening to sue someone. 

Point is, these folks are trained to handle it.
Drugs, distraction, and physical restraints when absolutely necessary.",2022-03-03 13:48:16,carolinabluebird,t5ymsq
Dementia,Mom was just diagnosed w early stage vascular dementia/mild cog impairment. Doc says she can live independently (contrary to what I’ve witnessed firsthand). Where do we go from here?,"The doc made lifestyle recommendations for my mom that include cardiovascular exercise & eating a balanced diet—two things my mom is not likely to do. Since retiring a decade ago, she spends all her time in her recliner watching junk tv and is always resistant to my suggestions for social activities, follow ups w doctors, etc. (She’s also a narcissist and I grew up being physically & emotionally abused by her). My life keeps being interrupted by having to care for her (she has a bad back and has needed several surgeries) and I am burnt out & resentful. I’m trying to gauge how fast this disease progresses; I’m eager to try and resume my own life before I yet again get yanked back into a caretaker role. Thanks in advance for any insight you can offer.","Hey as fellow child of a pair of abusive narcissists, I need you to know-There is ZERO shame in getting her a caretaker with her money or government assistance, do not give her money and mess up your future!!! and wash your hands of the situation. 
If you don't feel that you have the resources to be a care giver 100% DO NOT DO IT! 
Your mother will be getting the care she needs, and your mental and physical health and life won't suffer. Win. Win.
From my experience with my MIL, the medical world will claim they are ""fit to live independently"" as the assumption is you will be there 24/7 to facilitate that ""independence."" You need to make it crystal clear what your limits are to this doctor, and the nature of what is actually going on in the home. If you can't be there, there needs to be someone providing skilled nursing, otherwise she needs assisted living. Push for it, demand it. This is truly a case of the squeaky wheel getting the grease. Do what you need to in order to get her hooked into services now before the disease progresses and it gets even harder to transition care.

EDIT: I want to add that if she's a narcissist a) be sure you get a durable POA so you can make the needed medical/financial decisions without going  through her as a gatekeeper. You being her primary caregiver should be contingent on this. And b) truly consider if being her caregiver is actually something you CAN do, provided the history of abuse. You can still be her POA, but you can hire payees to handle bills and medical proxy's to handle taking her to appointments. And by hire I mean use the funds from her estate, not your own pocket. There are things you can do to limit your contact with her to protect your own mental well being, which is just as important here. Not everyone can bring their parents into their home to care for them, there are other options available, but it takes a lot of time and dedication (and money) in order to get those services working for you. Best of luck.
Our dad had dementia, but fortunately, when I became my mothers POA and POH my dad signed paperwork also and added me to his checking account. It came in handy when my dad started talking to scammers also, plus he was slipping drug addicts money, people who knew his name that used to go to his church. I took his checkbook and quit giving him $$ just to have in his pocket. Unfortunately, he got a $33 pension check from a part time job he used to have and they came to the house the day he got it, took him to the bank, he cashed it and they took $30 and gave him the rest. My dad had a habit of asking for a printout so he could balance his checkbook. I found the printout on the table and it showed how much he had in the bank. I was able to close his account, open a new one(with him with me), at my bank, then had his pension and SS transferred to the new account. All mail was forwarded to my brother's house and I gave him a checkbook also. He also got scammed by the people who used to push ""braces"" and ended up with 4 boxes of junk that I returned

We moved into his house, my 4 siblings and I and rotated to take care of him round the clock and it was hard for us. We could only due 4-5 days and rotate out

Do what you think is best for you, managing this situation by yourself, is not good self care.  There is nothing wrong with looking into a facility for her, it would be a safer environment for her and you also
Is this her reg doctor? How long has it been her doctor? Are you currently helping her? In other words, without you would her impairment be more obvious?
What's Mom's opinion on it? I would imagine she wants to live independently. Talk with her. See where she is on this. It's her life after all.
I could have written that. Wow. It took about a year for us with the last three weeks going very fast. Make your peace when the personality goes and deal with what you have the best you can. I am a month back into my life and so very much better. Hang in there.",2022-03-03 12:58:39,SuchMatter1884,t5xibu
Dementia,Dysphagia test,"Looking to see others experiences with issues swallowing. My grandma is stage 6 (maybe now moving into 7) and has aphasia (trouble speaking) and now we think she has progressed to dysphagia. 

A few weeks ago she seemed to aspirate on a french fry at dinner. Luckily she seemed to cough it out (did back blows) and a few days later my Mom took her to urgent care to get a chest x-ray. Grandma was still wheezing. It came back clear and was told she is just shallow breathing and try having her do deep breaths a few times a day. Yesterday I got a call from her Senior Center that she choked on a pea at lunch. It involved abdominal thrusts and back blows to have her clear it and stop coughing. Maybe 30 mins later her coughing had calmed and she could speak. 

I was just wondering how others handled it. I saw they can do a swallow test. If your LO had to change their food consistency was it a fight? We have a family of 6 (including her) and I'm not sure if she would eat if her meal appears different than what everyone has. We are on the search for a facility this year just because her care is mounting and I'm getting burned out. And this is a new decline I'm dreading.","Hey, sorry to hear this. They have exercises they can do with the patient to strengthen up the dysphagia. It can help. Gotta watch for aspirating food. Pretty typical to get left lung pneumonia from that in the elderly. For liquids, there is a product called Thickit that can help. 

I've noticed that it's a use it or lose it thing that can accelerate like lightning with dementia. I've switched to a timed ""ok the tv goes off now and you have to read and we talk"" once a day. It has helped some. Also, best thing I've done in awhile is buy a nutribullet pro with extractor blades. It's really made eating good nutritious food so much easier. I can even toss in raw carrots and puree them with beans etc and heat it up as a soup. It's really helped. 

Best of luck

Edit to.add: yes, that swallow test can help as it can give them an idea how bad it is, etc. Drs and providers like test results so they can dole out more services. It can make it easier for your loved one and you taking care of them. But rem you'll still have to yell at the hospital not to give them solid food. No one listens lol.",2022-03-03 09:16:24,garden_bug,t5sj5z
Dementia,Taking mom to neurologist today. Wondering if I should say anything while she is in the room....,"Hello :)  
My mother has been showing cognitive decline for about 5 years now.   They mostly manifest as short-term memory problems, loss of concentration.    However lately, she has been showing signs of deeper agitation.   She calls her sons up and says she want to divorce her husband, that he's not a warm man, etc.   This is her sweetheart of 40 years.   Her caregiver in many ways.   She also has moved out of their shared bedroom.    But when I'm over the house, she acts like nothing is wrong, often.  


The pandemic (and my divorce) has caused her circle to shrink.   She lost my ex-wife and my in-laws.  She has been with her husband in their small bubble.   He is going deaf and is vain about getting a hearing aid.   I've been imploring him to get one.   My mom is so intuitive and sensitive.   When she calls him cold and too focused (only in the last few weeks), i have to connect that with his lack of hearing / awareness.    


Anyway, I set up and appointment with her neurologist today.   The purpose is to get her into see a neuropsychiatrist and this is the first step.   Perhaps there is some medication that she can take to help her depression (i know the dangers of treating dementia patients for depression).  


The problem is, that we've been mostly shielding her from our thoughts about her 'delusions'.  She does know she has a bit of memory problems...but that's it.   She always resists the medications (namenda) and visits to any doctor that is connected to cognitive decline.   It's as if her pride and indignation are coming to the surface with this condition.  She thinks she's a 20 year old superstar. 

Do you guys think it makes any sense to bring up my concerns with her in the room?   Or does it makes sense just to observe her visits, and have a follow up call with the doctor.   I just know that if it was me who was the patient, I would want to have agency and awareness about it.   

Thanks!","I wrote a letter outlining my concerns and I handed it to the receptionist when we checked in at the doctor’s office.    I kept it concise.  The doctor then had a better idea of what was going on as we started the appointment.

Good luck today.  I found the neurologist appointment to be very helpful for my mom- he was honest and said the dementia was more advanced than I had realized and I started making plans for memory care.
Sorry about your mom. My mom is going through the same. I am her health care proxy and when I took her to her evaluation appointment she lied about her condition. When I tried to politely correct, she got combative and most likely embarrassed. She’s very independent and doesn’t want to admit these things. As well as, her hearing loss. In my opinion, sit on the appointment and just observe. The doctor will get a sense from the test they give. Then you can talk to the doctor after, privately and tell them what’s going on. Good luck!
My partner sent an email to the nerologist in advance detailing the major concerning behaviors. He is his mother's medical and financial POA, so the neurologist was able to ask some fact finding questions and answer some of my partners questions in advance. I think without prepping the doctor, that first visit would have been very difficult. My MIL's first inclination is to lie through her teeth about what she's actually experiencing. However, since her memory is shot she can't keep her story straight. So the doctor was able to ask her questions in multiple ways to land on a true answer from her. It was very telling for us.
In caring for my late Dad, and now my Mum throughout dementia dx I’ve found that emailing the Doctor my concerns - or speaking to them on the phone - has been the best because I never wanted to speak in front of them like they aren’t there, or bring up potentially upsetting situations or behaviors that they likely don’t remember but want the Doctor to be aware of, and potentially treat.
If you can't speak frankly to the doctor, and accept the short term distress, then you have very little hope in getting long term help.  Those who drown without a splash don't get the lifeguard's attention.
A point to bring up with your dad is that not getting hearing aids will actually make dementia and cognitive loss more likely for him. Not getting auditory input is bad for the brain.

Dementia,"Venting: Attorneys, facilities, and waitlists.","Yep, I'm here again.

Firstly, I'm going to be very transparent and divulge that about 4-5 years ago I had basically a nervous breakdown. I won't get into the reasons, but I was on medical leave from work for a year and was being treated for severe anxiety and depression.  The depression is gone now, I still have anxiety.  Because of this, I am very protective of my mental health.

On to the vent.

I hired an Elder Care attorney to help sort out how to get all of our ducks in a row for when Mom will need more care than I can provide for her.  Facilities are expensive, as you know, and my parents have very little money, which means they will qualify for Medi-Cal; however, the attorney said that we should never tell a facility that she will on Medi-Cal because they often claim there are only 3-5 beds available for Medi-Cal patients. She said to say we're private pay and once she's placed then we apply for Medi-Cal and once she's approved the facility will reimburse anything we paid out of pocket.

I had to fill out an application to get my mom on a waitlist at one of the facilities nearby.  I handed it in and they told me that this will get her on their waitlist, but that the likelihood that she'll be rejected when we've decided it's time because they don't have enough money.

So how the f\*ck are we going to get her into a facility if they're going to decide she's too poor to get in? I can't tell them she'll have Medi-Cal, so now what? What kind of circle of hell is this?

I've emailed the attorney about this and a few other concerns and I haven't heard back from her in a week.

I. AM. FREAKED.OUT.

What if I can't get her placed?  She deserves proper care and I don't want to have another breakdown, and I WILL if I have to keep this up. I'm exhausted and stressed out.

Vent over. Thank you all.","I wish I had advice for you but I don’t; I’m not yet to the point of getting my mom into a facility (though I wish I were for my own sanity). But I wanted to acknowledge your post and send you some support & love. Your mental health is precious and so worth protecting, and I truly hope that you get answers and a swift resolution soon. No matter what, remember to keep on prioritizing yourself. 💗

ETA: I’d go ahead and give the attorney a call. Keep the pressure on (if you have it in you) until you get a response. (Squeaky wheel & all that). Lives are at stake and your and your mom’s well-being are worth it.",2022-03-02 21:49:18,PowertothePixie,t5h9aa
Dementia,Odd question maybe...have you see dementia affect someone's smile?,"The other day my mom was super happy about something she was telling me and she smiled really big, like scary big and intense. It was actually alarming seeing her face like that. 

Does dementia change people's facial expressions to be more extreme? Have you experienced odd or scary expressions with your loved one? I felt so bad but I even had to look away, it was just so unnerving.","I've not experienced strange facial features but have so for noises. My Grandma now makes this guttural breathy chuckle that I can't replicate. And I don't remember her laughing like that at all. She does it a lot now.
Yes. Same with my mom, it's been getting worse too. I like to have a few pictures around of her laughing and smiling so I can remember that's the smile that she's giving me. ❤
Yup. I didn't notice it as much with my mom but several others in the memory care were terrifying when they smiled, it was like a serial killer in a movie type smile. Mostly it was because it was all in their mouth, it didn't reach their eyes.",2022-03-02 19:58:32,Anticrepuscular_Ray,t5f2su
Dementia,"Advice on how “look back period” works and what assisted living home is “allowed” to look at (in VA, USA)","Hi lovely people. My dad just has his pension and SSI and lives in my home for the past year.

He’s stage 5/6 and I can no longer care for him, he needs 24/7 watching and care. So time for assisted living and memory care.

If I tell the assisted care places I am looking at that we are private pay, his income is “XX” per month… and we won’t be asking for Medicare assistance, what documentation do they still require (if any)? 

I read online that they will ask for bank statements to “prove” he (or I) can pay privately and how long they might have to wait before trying to bill Medicare, is this accurate?

I don’t want them in my business and bank accounts. Dads bank account I can understand more, and it will show his modest income. But I will need to supplement his income with my earnings to make up the difference between the AL home $$ and his income, and I’ve made different life choices than he has and therefore my bank account looks different than his. I just don’t see why it’s anyone’s business if the check cashes for them every month, year, whatever. 

I have POA, am dads health proxy if that is relevant in any way. 

Thank you so much for guidance if you’ve been through this experience!","At the 3 facilities I applied to for grandma, they didn't require any proof. Just an estimate of her assets, and monthly income. No need to show them bank statements or anything like that. I'm guessing if there comes a point where he would need Medicare assistance, they would need to have bank statements to report back to Medicare? But I'd cross that bridge once you get there.
Couple of thoughts: 

Sounds like you are talking about medicaid (not medicare). Medicare pays for health care, hospitalization, will pay for temporary nursing home care, but does not pay for long term residential care. Medicaid kicks in to pay for long term care once a person has less than $2000 to their name (also will pay health costs for someone younger that doesn't yet qualify for medicare,, but that's an aside to this situation).

The government does not expect kids to to use their money to pay for parents' care unless parents have been giving kids their money during the lookback period (5 years for most states). The state Medicaid system will pay for care for people living at facilities that have a medicaid contract, but only after they have verified your dad has less than $2000 to his name. Medicaid will want to see his financial info, not yours. They will want to see that he hasn't been giving away his money in the past 5 years so he can qualify for Medicaid faster. That's the lookback period. For example if they see he's given you $5000, they might say he would have to wait to qualify for Medicaid until he's had $5000 more worth of care. If you own property together it gets more complicated.

If its private pay, some facilities may ask to see a bank statement showing a balance so they know someone will be able to pay. That can be done showing just the balance and they don't want to see individual transactions. But medicaid will want to see individual transactions.

Also, if your dad was in military service he may have a whole other source of funding for long term care, but I haven't had to research that so I don't know. 

I found it helpful to pay for one meeting with an elder law attorney to understand this process and have individual questions answered. 

Hope this is helpful, best wishes.
There is only a look back period once you apply for Medicaid. If you are ""self-pay"" they do NOT care where the money comes from and won't even ask! 

It could be gun-running cocaine money from a human trafficker... they do👏not👏care👏 

As for that magic $2,000 figure... its NOT ""all they have to their name"", it's PER MONTH income.

Unless you are applying for Medicaid, the assisted living places will not need proof of anything although they usually do want you to sign up for autopay. If he himself can qualify for Medicaid, don't give him money...just do the Medicaid thing. If you are trying to preserve his assets (real estate, investments, etc...) then yeah, self-pay is the way to go. 

We set up an ""Irrevocable, Income Only Trust"" with my dad's lawyers. We put ALL his estate holdings into it to shield them from Medicaid. We kept his bank account open to accept his pension and SSI payments. Because he doesn't legally still own the assets in the trust, he will qualify for Medicaid to start paying after 5 years have passed since the trust was opened. THAT is what they mean about a look back period. It refers to Medicaid looking back for a period of five years before your application to see if you have done anything with assets that could have been used to pay for your care during that time. They look to see if you have sold your house for $1 to your nephew for example, or if you have made a wedding gift of a substantial amount of money to your daughter, Etc. If they see that things like that have gone on in that previous five-year window oh, they will deny your application for Medicaid. Once the five-year look-back is over, any former assets that a person used to have do not count anymore.

I am the trustee of the trust and can sell off assets if needed to pay for things before that 5 years goes by but he cannot,  and does not, have any say over the assets in the trust AT ALL. That part is a really important distinction because if he controls any of those assets, Medicaid would expect him to be able to pay and then he would be denied. They would have to sell all the real estate he has gathered over his lifetime, he would have to get rid of his family home place, there would be nothing to leave for his descendants, etc.

This is something that really has to be done by lawyers though so if you decide to do that spend some money to do it right. And as you can see a relative can be the trustee so it has to be somebody you trust but that will save some money as well. The whole thing requires the person with dementia to really trust the person they put in there as the trustee because they are signing away anything of worth that they own. It's also important to note the person has to do it while they are still able to understand what they're doing. Setting up a trust like this cannot be done from my understanding once the person has been judged incompetent by the legal system. The main thing is they still preserve their estate and if their trustee is Honorable, the person will still be cared for until Medicaid can take over.

I know I wrote a whole lot here and probably more than you needed to know but I wish you good luck and if I can be of any help you can certainly ask.",2022-03-02 17:35:13,AncillaryHeroine,t5c4lo

The problem ist, that he will throw everything away, which he can't identify or labels as useless. (this would include smart watches)

Dementia patients love music, they find it very soothing and relaxing.

I had a giant Spotify playlist for my mom. Music helps a ton. If he played an instrument get him whatever it is.
Willie Nelson got us through today
My late father enjoyed jazz and I'd often record my gigs and play them back via YouTube on his TV. He enjoyed it, though I lost count of the number of times I had to explain where the video was coming from (you know how they say you'll miss that some day? Well....).
Music, art, pictures, stories from the past if they might still recall. Those small things that can bring joy are the best way to relate to them. I like to think if it as the ultimate in mindfulness.

Dementia,Hospital tells us we have no options,"My wife's father was diagnosed with late stage dimensia and has type 1 diabetes. He is very aggressive, can't walk, and his blood sugar crashes constantly needing medical aid. My wife had a meeting with the hospital and they explained to her that they cannot keep him any longer and he does not qualify for nursing home or hospice. They said our only options is to take him home which isn't an option due to the severity of his illness or they can remove his monitors and let him live out his last days without intervention,essentially euthanizing him (in my opinion). Has anyone else been in a similar situation and if so. What did you do.",">or they can remove his monitors and let him live out his last days without intervention,essentially euthanizing him (in my opinion)

What, exactly, do you think hospice entails?  It sounds like you are refusing hospice care.  This is fine, but the decision creates consequences.  You might not like these consequences and if not, then best to change your decision.  

It might help to look up the definition of euthanasia.  Try to figure out how this is different from stopping artificial means of extending life.  Because that's not opinion, that's definitional.
Are you in the US?  It's my understanding that if you refuse to take him home due to an inability to properly and safely care for him that they have to refer him to a skilled nursing facility.  I'd call [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/talk-to-someone) and find out what rights you have.  I'd also call my [local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association](https://www.alz.org/local_resources/find_your_local_chapter).
Under Medicare guidelines which governs hospice whether or not somebody has Medicare a person has to have a certifiable terminal illness with a prognosis of six months or less.

There are hospices that sometimes admits a patient that the doctors may be in a belief that the patient may have a turn for a worse within the first benefit period there might be enough decline to continue keeping the patient on hospice but if the patient isn’t terminal to start in my own experience such a disservice to the family because maybe they need Home health or visiting nurses. And speaking of that you may want to ask the provider for recommendations for visiting nurses or home health.

Also check with your local office of the aging to see if they have any resources.
It seems very unlikely he does not qualify for hospice care, though that does not mean the cost is covered. As days above the department of aging should be a good resource
Contact a private hospice which medicare covers and get a second opinion.
did you speak with a case worker in the hospital? they tried to send my grandpa home and i didn’t feel comfortable with being able to care for him. He had a PT evaluation and it was determined he couldn’t return home. the case worker helped with this. he can possibly go to a “rehab” or a skilled nursing facility like mentioned above. sorry that hospitals suck
What are the benefits of keeping him living in this condition?  Is that something he would want? I assume he has no living will or instructions on what he wants done in this type of condition. In any event, call a private hospice and they will evaluate him, he does not have to be within 6 months of dying to be considered.
I would also try contacting your county or city's Adult Protective Services office. APS offices provide social services to abused, neglected, or exploited elders or adults with certain disabilities. They may be able to help you find care options. 

Someone else mentioned calling Medicaire and Google ""Dementia Care Services"" in your area. 

I'm sorry you're in this difficult situation.",2022-03-02 15:34:47,miller1501,t59ijt
Dementia,Apps for a Kindle fire,Im a home health aide and I have an old kindle fire I'm going to give to my patient any apps you would recommend? It's an old kindle so only things you can get from the Amazon app store. Thanks. I'm looking for a good dementia clock mainly. Also any tips I was hoping I can get Alexa to say things without asking like in the morning say good morning tell her the date and time and the weather. Something like that.,"Here’s the list I used for my Mom: https://www.formyplan.com/elder-law/alzheimers-dementia/2020/02/26/ten-apps-and-other-activities-for-people-with-dementia-and-alzheimers/

Very kind of you.
We got my grandmaw a library card so she could listen to audiobooks and look at magazines. She has to have a little help with it. I think she really enjoys the cookbooks and magazines more than anything because she doesn’t have to remember anything.",2022-03-02 15:08:29,Lalalalalastanding,t58xt0
Dementia,Could a jolt to the brain help people with Alzheimer's?,,,2022-03-02 14:51:42,Starrchaser21,t58jtt
Dementia,My grandpa doesn’t sleep at night he just sits there all night long. Doesn’t talk doesn’t do anything. Whenever I have to leave him sitting in the living room alone to go up to sleep it breaks my heart because I feel like I’m abandoning him.,,"I dont know if its a thing but the same goes with my mother. I once heard her walking around at 3-4 am so i put a fitness tracker on her... and sure enough she only sleeps for an hour max each night. dont know why. I would tuck her in her blankets and she would close her eyes until i leave, but gets up from bed soon after.
Ohh gee that feels sad, anoncaliuser, sorry.  My mum stays awake much of the night but at least I can usually get her to go to bed, by midnight-ish usually.  She'll keep the bedside light on, 'reading' (dozing off & waking & reading).  Have you searched the dementia .org & alzheimers .org websites / telephone counselling help-lines to find some tips & tactics & techniques to try manage that?  They have great resources & information n all.  Sometimes it's very challenging to get them to go bed.   Or maybe his doctor can prescribe some meds to help him sleep some?    It's tough.  Best of luck!
My dad sleeps almost all day, and gets up at 2 am.  I was concerned at first, but then I read that this is the norm for dementia.
Do you have any sleep aid medication?
My mom has started doing this and she's also become more paranoid and aggressive.  I called her PCP and they prescribed her Seroquel to help with the anxiety that's causing her aggression and it helps with sleep.  This might be an option for you.  

I had to ask for meds for her because I wasn't getting any sleep worrying about her getting hurt or overeating (she'll eat non-stop if I don't watch her). Tonight is the first night we're trying it so I'm hoping it works well for her. 

Good luck, OP. I'm sorry you're having a difficult time.",2022-03-02 05:06:02,anoncaliuser,t4wyvn
Dementia,What keeps you going and not giving up?,"I (23) have spent my last 4 years looking after my father (87) with dementia. Now, I feel like I have truly hit rock bottom. Internally, I know I can not give up as he needs me, but my brain is exhausted.

What keeps you going through the hard times?","I’m so sorry you are having to deal with this especially at such a young age.

I also hit many low spots with my mom (she passed away last fall, almost 88), I lost so much sleep with anxiety for about 10-12 years.  The last four years of her life were in assisted living (I am so grateful she could afford it!) but I still had a lot of anxiety with reports of her bad behavior, falls, trips to the ER, then Covid lockdown for 18 months, etc.  Eventually her bad behavior plateaued with meds, with occasional flare ups.  Even before Covid, vacations were stressful because I constantly worried she would have an emergency.  

What kept me going? The support of friends, getting to know the Memory Care staff, residents and their families - gosh I miss some of them so much!  But I sure wish I had known about this forum.

You ought to contact your local Alzheimer’s support group or Council on Aging (or equivalent) - they may have some resources that could help with your stress.  If nothing else it helps to vent with other people going through the same thing.",2022-03-02 04:34:23,golfblink,t4wj2u
Dementia,I'm in limbo,"I and my two adult daughters live in Colorado. In October my very independent, very private, father had a fall and was taken to the hospital. He had been living alone a long time in Indiana. He was found to be very confused and had been diagnosed with dementia of the unspecified sort a few years prior but I did not know that because he never told anyone. We used to talk on the phone quite a bit but I hadn't seen him in person in probably the past 2 years. He never really wanted company. We had a good relationship, just didn't see each other much. When I got to Indiana to the hospital where he was after his fall I realized he was going to need a lot of help. I retained an elder-care attorney firm and we did all the necessary Powers of Attorney. My dad understood the need for help and wanted me to help him. I did understand the enormity of what I signed up to do for him as his power of attorney for health care and his finances so I'm not complaining about that part. I'm grateful I could have time off from my job and grateful that my father trusted me to help him. When he was medically well from the hospital he was released to a rehab unit to regain stamina and steadiness and balance in walking. He went through that rehab process fairly well and was ready to be discharged after about 3 weeks. His home in Indiana had deteriorated quite a bit. He was a bit of a hoarder had been confused for a few years and the plumbing did not work. I knew his home was not the proper place for him and I knew I could not take care of him by myself. I know more now about Home Health Options but at the time I really felt I was not equipped to do even that with him in Indiana. My brother lives in Florida and does not travel. He had not had a good relationship with my father since our parents divorced when I was nine and my brother was six. This was painful to my father and he expressed several times he would like a better relationship with his son. I decided we should go to Florida and ""see what it's like to be retired"" while we visited him over the holidays. That was how I presented it to my father but in reality it was to see if a memory care unit in Florida could be a good thing for him. My reasoning was that my brother and my father would have a better chance for a stronger Bond before my father passes and that I would be able to work at my job in Colorado during the Summers as usual and then come to Florida in the winters. As I said my mother and father divorced when we were both very young so my mother who also lives in Florida (close to my brother) would not have been an appropriate person to have my father stay with LOL. I did ask if I could stay in her extra bedroom while we visited. My father would be in the memory care unit and I would be in her extra bedroom and we would all be able to visit during the holidays and things will be great! Well not really. We got to FL Dec 6th, 2021. Dad was okay in the memory care unit walking fine handling his own dementia okay kind of more confused but in pretty good health and we visited often. Really we visited every day just not all day long everyday. On January 4th my dad stood up too fast and fell at his memory care place. We found out that he was pretty dehydrated and that probably made him faint when he stood up like that. He was taken to a hospital to check his head since no one witnessed his fall and they wanted to make sure he wouldn't have any head trauma from the fall. In that hospital he stayed there four days because of the dehydration and was doing okay. On the day they were going to release him back to the memory care unit he tested positive for covid. Luckily he ended up not having severe symptoms because he was vaccinated but unluckily he was then in an isolation unit and they would not let him get up out of the bed because they thought he was a fall risk. He laid in the bed in that hospital for more than 10 days. As most people know the longer you are bedridden the more muscle mass and strength you lose. Also unbeknownst to me he was developing bed sores. He got them on the backs of his heels, on his sacrum, one on each buttock, and was developing one on his testicles as well. The hospital told me repeatedly that there was no problem and that he had no bed sores from being immobile with no one moving him or repositioning him because he was in isolation. I asked them every few days.. When he was finally cleared to leave that hospital he was released to a rehab unit to try to get his strength back. That particular rehab unit alerted me that he had these bedsores when he got to them and that the one on his sacrum was severe . However they also overly medicated him with Seroquel, did not move him, did not keep him hydrated or fed either. My brother and I visited him every day but of course we weren't there all day long everyday and it never occurred to me that he might be further and further dehydrating and not getting food. On his third day there he had to go to the hospital by ambulance because of going into hypovolemic shock due to low blood volume which is directly caused by severe dehydration. He almost died. He was septic. He was in the ICU two days and then spent about two more weeks in that second Hospital before he was medically stable enough to be released to the rehab facility he is in now. They have him on a special bed and his sores are slowly healing thank God. He is able to eat and some days able to feed himself if his hands are not shaking too badly. He has been able to stay hydrated as well. I go everyday in the mornings until around 2 in the afternoon. My brother comes by around 2:30 or 3 but has to go back to work after about an hour. Sometimes but not always I go back in the later afternoon or possibly early evening it depends on how much I can take emotionally. Most of the time I think I did the right thing bringing him down here because if that memory care place had worked I think it would have been good. He was only there a little less than a month before this fall and ever since then things have been so hard for him. He was walking fine 2 months ago. Never needed a walker or a cane and didn't even touch the walls as he walk down the hallways. Now he just lies in the bed and even though there is Rehabilitation, he won't be able to stand until the wounds on his heels heal. I find myself feeling so guilty about bringing him here instead of being brave and keeping him at his home in Indiana. Now the way things are I can't even take him there because he can't sit up more than a couple of hours at a time because of the sores on his fanny. I feel like I have done a bad job for my dad who trust me literally with his life. He does remember who I am most of the time but a lot of his other conversations are very confused and anxious. He still tells me thank you when I help him get his water or feed him or wipe his mouth or hold his hand and he still tells me he loves me. I love him with all my heart he's the sweetest funniest man I've ever known. I really thought I could do better for him than what I have turned out to be able to do. Sometimes I don't know where the future is taking us and I don't want to be the reason that his quality of life has disappeared. I prayed so hard cuz he was in the ICU. I have the faith that Saint Anthony worked miracles with God to save my dad. I feel guilty because I don't know if he is glad to still be with us or not. I know it was selfish of me to ask God to save him or to ask Saint Anthony for the Miracles. I'm down second-guessing myself all the time I don't usually do that. Most of the time I can handle it but tonight I feel so confused and worried and lost. All I wanted to do was help him and I feel like I haven't done that even though I know it's not really my fault. I'm sorry for posting such a long pity party story but I know if anyone understands these complicated things it would be you guys.","Please don't beat yourself up over this. Everything that you did for your dad you did out of love and care.  Hoping for nothing but the best for you guys.
If you had a crystal ball you would have made different decisions.  I can tell how hard this is on you but you were doing everything right.  This is all new for you, your family and your father and every step is a learning experience.  You had his best interest in mind in every step you took, I don't see what you could have done differently. Release your anxiety and guilt and just keep loving and taking care of him the best you can.
Ohh, BotherKey, nnnooooo, so sorry, I feel for you!   It's not a pity-party at all, that's hard, and sad.  You were trying your best to help yr dad out, you weren't expecting the health system was letting him down.   Really, if he'd stayed home so far away from you & sibling, even with home care assistance, for sure sooner or later (probably sooner) an even worse tangle would have befallen him.  I think your plan was/is best option, you did good.  Often at elderly states, when one thing happens it's just a domino reaction of following crisis & problems, and on top of that this danged pandemic - very tough.  It's wonderful that he's now pulling through! 

 But yeh, sadly, sometimes at hospitals/facilities one needs to also monitor the procedures & processes & treatments, just to double-triple check.

My very elderly dad had a health crisis some years ago, was in ICU having stomach operations, afterwards in the rehab hospital he was still so weak & confused couldn't even stand up alone, couldn't walk, couldn't understand newspaper headlines or a bar of soap - doctors said maybe that was it for him.   Hospital food wasn't at all sufficient for the strength & muscle re-building after such incidents, I considered. After reserch, I was practically force-feeding him Sustagen-type protein/vitamin drinks & extra Vit C tabs a few times daily. I'd put him in wheelchair taking out to sunshine in the carpark garden & playing his old favourites music from his younger days on the car stereo full blast.  That seemed to perk him up quite a bit, the hospital environment was deadening.  

 I asked a rehab therapist & also googled, photocopied him some simple exercises to do, got him doing them a few times a day.  Short bursts, and not like 10 - 20 pushups lol.   Stand - sit - stand - sit - stand - sit, x 4 or 5 times a day.  Sitting in chair - leg lifts, toe touches (right hand to left knee/shin/foot & viceversa) , reach for the roof, etc.  Every 2 or 3 days increased the reps.  Got him a pair of kids squidgee balls to squeeze in both hands as he's just sitting there watching tv.  After a few weeks he started getting stronger & better.  Even ended up walking ok - slowly, albeit - and being able to return to his own apartment, with lot of home-care support visits scheduled weekly.   (In hindsight, that was a great mistake - he actually ought to have transitioned directly to residential facility, but that's another story.) 

I guess yr dad needs to be residential, it's time.  I hope you've brought familiar favourite items of his from his old home, he'll settle into a new place.   It can't be helped, BotherKey, at some point everybody gets old, seems like it was impossible for him to be left way off in Indiana, I think you've done best option, and now what happens happens.   Best of luck to you all!   \* hugs \*",2022-03-02 01:23:45,BotherKey6043,t4tpm7
Dementia,A little lightness in all the grief.,"Here's a bittersweet little story for you. Take it as you will. I'm still trying to figure out what to make of it.

My dad died February 12 after a 5 year fight with Lewy Body dementia. The grief is complicated - the heaviness of sadness mixed with a lightness at the thought that he's finally free of the hell Lewy put him through.

A few days after he died, my mom came to me, held out her hand, and said, ""Look what I found."" She was wearing her old wedding and engagement rings.

The thing is, she'd lost those about a year ago. She'd taken them to the jeweler's for a cleaning, but made the mistake of putting them into a pants pocket instead of, say, her purse. When she got out of the car at home, she couldn't find them. She dug through her pockets, combed the street, house, yard, shook the pants out, and I and a few other people did all that with her. Nothing. Her rings, it seemed, were gone. It hit her hard, naturally. Her husband of 50+ years was slowly dying, and now she didn't even have the rings he gave her.

While nothing could replace their sentimental value, they were at least insured, so after a few months she started the process of getting replacements made based on the old designs.

My dad died on a Saturday. Then, the next Wednesday, my mom happened to shake out that same pair of pants and then...<plink> <plink> Out fall her lost rings.

Now, I'm an atheist, a scientist, and the person who, at age 5, tried earnestly to prove to my parents that Santa didn't exist. (It made no sense. How could he visit so many places in one night, deer couldn't fly, and by the way, we didn't even HAVE a chimney.) So I'm the last person to get superstitious or talk about ""signs from beyond"".

But half a dozen people looked in those pockets, over and over, and all could have sworn they weren't there, and I'll be damned if that wasn't a last gift from my dad to my mom - a little nudge from beyond to help her find the rings he gave her over 50 years ago, and that she thought were lost forever.

It's a pleasant thought, anyway. Just thought I'd share.","After my mom died about 8 years ago, my dad was devastated.  Shortly after, their dog died as well.  My parents always had dogs and loved each of them deeply.  It seemed impossibly sad that my poor dad lost mom and the dog in such short order.  But he knew he couldn’t go on without a dog, so my sister quickly found a golden retriever rescue in San Diego (their last number of dogs were all goldens).  They went there, and one particular dog immediately latched onto my dad, licked his face and basically wouldn’t leave his side.  They decided on the spot that this was his next dog.  When they started doing the paperwork, they noticed that the dog’s rescue number was 11356:  my parents were married on Jan. 13, 1956.  Did Mom have anything to do with Dad getting the best dog and best friend he ever had?  The dog certainly has made these last years more bearable for him.
Stranger things have happened!
That’s an amazing story!

My husband has LBD. I’m so sorry for this cruel disease that took your father. I am a chemical engineer but I do have a belief system because over the years, things have happened to me that were unexplainable by conventional means. That’s in no way meant as a criticism, I couldn’t figure out how to state it to make sure I didn’t offend. 

I worry because we are getting close to the 5 year mark and that seems to be the most common length of time that many people with LB last after their diagnosis.
What a nice story. I am sorry for your loss. My MIL is in 2-3 years into LBD and it’s hard to live through every day.
That’s so sweet 🥲",2022-03-01 23:19:26,microbewhisperer,t4rh41
Dementia,Falling behind,"I really messed up. 

I've been taking care of my mom the last 4 years.  She has dementia. 

Unfortunately, I forgot to get the car inspected, and the registration has been expired for almost a year.  I got two tickets today on my way to pay the house taxes.  

This is completely my fault.  For the record, the cop who ticketed me was very civil.  Even patiently waited while I pulled up my insurance card on my phone.  He was just doing his job. 

First thing tomorrow I will get the car inspected.  Then I have to handle the registration.  From what I understand I can handle the tickets online three days from now.  If possible I will ask for a reduction as I'm guessing they will be upwards of $100.

A squirrel or raccoon or something is in the attic, since yesterday.  The kitchen sink faucet is leaking and the valves are stuck.  It feels like everything is going wrong.  My mom said ""I love you baby"" the other day, first time in many months.  That one good thing happened and everything else seems to be falling apart.","I get it. I'm right there with you ... but probably worse. If i listed all the things that I KNOW about that i haven't got around to due to my fathers deterioration. You would be amazed. 
 On the bright side the things that i have been keeping up with are astounding. So i usually try not to beat myself up too much. 
 I've been managing to stay (mostly) positive and make the best of the situation that i have. It's not my first rodeo though. My wife died of cancer 6 years ago and left me with a 2 year old that is now 8. I haven't been employed in 6 years but I'm managing decently well.
 It's difficult to make the best of shitty situations but it's not impossible.
I'm so sorry, I know what that can be like, I'm currently going through something similar, this week has been so overwhelming.
Everything needs attending to, maintainance, bills, work, banks, loans, I've been getting fines here and there, my mind is scattered, I can barely hold a conversation without my thoughts drifting about. The world seems to be going full charge ahead and I'm struggling to keep up as well as be there for our loved ones who are going through dementia.

I hope your week or year gets better OP.
Here's to getting on top of things and may things flow easier! 
Praying we all get through this.
My mantra is: “All I can do is my best, and I’m doing it” I say or think it in low points, even when my best doesn’t feel like ‘enough’ Also stuff like car tags…I dunno where you are but hitting the DMV during COVID has been a struggle for everyone so you deserve a pass on that. You’re getting it sorted out. You’re doing your best! 

Cheering you on!
I hear ya. I've been dropping a WHOLE lot of balls for a long time now. The way I look at it, our brains are computers with a limited amount of processing power, and ours are so busy processing all the burdens of caregiving that there just isn't enough left over for stuff like, say, renewing car registration.
Oh dang, ThrowADanny, sorry for that.  It's so hard sometimes, keeping track of & on top of things.  You didn't mess it up that much, surely you're doing a great job!  It's been tremendously difficult through this pandemic, as well.   It sure is infuriating and demoralising though isn't it, when the last straw strikes.  I feel for you!

I got pulled over by the cops last year too, with mum in the car.  We were so surprised, mum thought it was the end of the world - I immediately apologised to the cop who said ""OH-HO, so you KNOW what you've done wrong then!?""  I had zero idea, said well you've pulled me over so I must have done something but I can't think what - he told me the rego & accompanying insurance had lapsed by a month, kapowie that's a massive fine down here in Aust  I was gutted, nearly burst into tears - he was pretty cool, checked my record, since there was nothing, he wrote me a paper allowing me 2 hrs to get back to home only (15 min drive) and said if I was stopped by another cop car outside of that route & time that they'd ticket me for sure, and that I'd damn well better not have an accident or I'd be in enormous trouble.

I hate those times that snowball - the roof gutters full of leaves and may be a storm on the way, all the scissors disappeared cos she's taken them out to the garden one by one & lost them, toilet's not flushing properly again, can't find her medication WebsterPak cos she's taken it off idk where maybe it's under her bedding or got in the newspaper recycling bin,  spend an hour searching for the broom finally find it outside on the footpath, she's used all the dishwashing detergent to mop the already-clean kitchen floor while I was up on the roof clearing the gutters and half the food from the freezer is out on the counter defrosting because 'but what will we have for dinner', all our clothes came out of washing machine covered in tissue pulp cos I missed one hoarding of tissues in her jacket pocket, just want to have a nice cup of tea after the gutter/scissors/broom/mop/freezer/laundry saga, but we've run out of teabags.   Doh.... 

We get critters in our roof sometimes too - at least they're territorial so there'll be only one of them as well as fight off mice & rats,  very cute Australian marsupial brushtail possum they don't eat wiring or insulation, AND they don't poop or pee where they sleep.  The roof is enormous it's an antique house so no chance to block all the gaps - should have replaced it years ago.  No sense now to spend all that money - it's not leaking, she'll either be in a residential facility soon, or over the rainbow.  Whoever buys the house next can deal with that problem lol.   Sorry about your critter though, racoon sounds undesirable.

Sigh, what days.... Best of luck, ThrowADanny!
Same boat here. Have you heard the spoon analogy for mental health/depression? Using that analogy, I constantly feel like I have 100+ of stuff to get done, only get 20 spoons a day to handle that stuff...and some of the stuff I get done, has to be repeated the next day.

Between stuff for my Dad (who I am his 24/7 care giver), my stuff, and my son's stuff...I sometimes don't know whether I'm coming or going. I am in the middle of working through two sets of paperwork for stuff through the VA...one to help me potentially get paid a little for caring for him, the other set to help us get a wheelchair ramp. That is on top of his daily care and managing appointments, medicine refills, and the HHAs we not get (thankfully) for 2-3 hours a day. I am STILL trying to organize our place after having my Dad moved in with me officially since December 1st, and trying to decide where to put everything. I have a broken tooth I need to have seen...but in the middle of trying to find a reasonable dentist that takes my insurance and is not too far away (as I would have to fit said appointment into a day/time that the HHA will be here, since my father cannot be left alone), as long travel time would cut into potential appointment time.

There have been many times I wished I could clone myself a few times, give them a bunch of coffee, and delegate some stuff out to. Lol.
One of the things I underestimated was he degree I was overwhelmed by caring for my father … I completely lost my sense of self … all of my effort went into the minutiae of his care and I let my life go … my finances, relationships, job, health and mental stability suffered … of course dad’s final days were my concern, but in hindsight, I should’ve paid attention to my own needs, details and care … I’m sorry this happened … if you can, take a few moments out of your day for yourself … those moments may avail some clarity and prove very beneficial
It's important that you be kind to yourself.  Sure, there are times when it seems like buying a new identity and fleeing to the Seychelles is your only option but eventually, things will be back to normal.  Look for the bright spots and bask in them.
I was right there last year. Remembered to register my parents cars but totally spaced on mine and got a ticket. We also have squirrels in the attic 🤣 and bonus opposums under the house. Just take it day by day. 

On another note, sometimes I obsessively watch the show Father Brown because he is always so chill when things go wrong, or even when he messes up. Then I pretend to be him when I want to start freaking out.
i once let my own registration slide due to complete ignorance and the insurance was cancelled. but i got new insurance, so it
got settled, but i don’t remember how much i paid.  it happens.  i hope you don’t have to pay too much.  👍

also, bought myself a monthly planner in the “ever onward” hopes of trying to become more organized and less scatterbrained, more obvious recently for some reason.  here’s to Hope!  💪
This is so me! I have to make myself a list of things I need to get done and still forget. Taking care of someone is hard. Be nice to yourself!
It's awful when everything snowballs like this!

For the car, check the sequence of events of what to do. In Massachusetts you need a current registration to get your car inspected, and you need to pay your tickets before renewing your registration. Double check that your insurance is up to date too!

An exterminator can help with the squirrel if it doesn't leave. They can chew on wires so key an eye /ear on it.

Dementia,Namenda for dementia patient,"Has any caregiver tried treating a dementia patient with Namenda? My wife, aged 74, is somewhere between stages 5 and 6 of Alzheimer’s. How effective is Namenda likely to be in her case? I’m skeptical about the benefits claimed for the drug, but it would be useful to hear what others have to say.","When my grandma was around mid-stages, the Namenda helped a lot with her cognition but brought about other, more detrimental symptoms such as aggression, paranoia, and constipation. She didn't want to take it anymore because of the side effects, so we stopped. She's now late stages and her care team tried putting her on it again with no results.

I think it just depends on the benefits versus the side effects. If you find that it isn't helping much at all, she can always stop taking it.
My mother is 78, diagnosed about 4 years ago.  Late stages.  Has been taking Namenda twice a day basically the whole time.  She still remembers us(my sister and I) or at least that we're friendly to her.
It helped my dad in the early to mid stages. It gradually stopped helping towards the later stages - I'd say maybe the last year of his life. (His dementia was 5 years from diagnosis to death.)
Namenda (generic is called memantine) can be helpful in preserving cognition for some people.  It’s generally titrated, meaning you start with one dosage once a day and then they gradually increase the dosage and the frequency. With all of these types of drugs that are treating the symptoms of dementia, I find things to be very variable from person to person. For some people they work wonders and for others they don’t work or might even have detrimental effects. Interestingly enough,memantine can also be used to treat aggressive behaviors that might be associated with dementia.  (This was a positive side effect they discovered in a research trial) BUT like another poster mentioned, it could also CAUSE aggression for others. Close monitoring for the positive or negative affects is critical and making sure there is frequent communication between you and the prescriber. I own a very small memory care facility and we work with behavioral health providers to Make sure we have the experts managing these types of medications.  Meaning, the resident has a monthly appointment, as well as interim communication any time a medication is started, stopped, or changed.  If it were my loved one, I would want the baseline cognitive tests do there could be a comparison. I also think that on this medication, to see positive effects, the person should be in an environment that stimulates their cognition.  For example, If the person is going to be sitting around all day and just watching television, the positive effects may be less obvious than if they are participating in a game or engaging in a social activities.  For the folks that have a positive response to the medication, we often see increased socialization from people that maybe were more reserved. I doubt that’s in the research but it’s something anecdotal I see that positively impacts both the person with dementia as well as their family members or caregivers.
My mother just started it and she is in the mid stages now. From what I have read it should work well for a period of time before it no longer can hold up against her inevitable decline. She’s lost the ability to perform instrumental tasks without assistance (cleaning the house, driving safely, filling her medications, cooking) but remains happy. I’m interested to see what it can do for her. So far I haven’t noticed a difference but if it’s point is to keep her where she is, I guess that’s goof.
My husband started this drug recently and so far he’s been more agitated and paranoid that normal. I can’t be sure is the drug or if he’s having a bad patch that happens to coincide with the introduction of the drug. I’m going to give it a bit more time and then follow up with his provider.
In my experience as a registered nurse the medication for early stage dementia that include the medication mentioned by the opening poster does not work in middle to late stages and furthermore as side effects which increased the problems that caregivers have in caring for the patient such as increased risk for falls. Early stage dementia using the FAST scale is stages one through five.",2022-03-01 18:01:14,Verso510,t4kzao

Dementia,I didn't think it'd happen to my mom,"I could tell it was starting to happen to my mom about 5 years ago - she started asking what's for dinner several times a day, then ""where are my black shoes"" when she never has had any. Then my dad passed away a year ago and she moved in with my sister after I had been taking care of her for many years at home. When I visit she can't remember if her husband is gone half the time.  When she asks where he is I dont know weather to say he's dead or he's just napping. It's getting worse as time goes on and I'm afraid she'll end up in a home somewhere if my sister can't handle it anymore.","Please don't think of it as ""ending up in a home."" Putting your mom in memory care some day might be the safest thing for her and the thing that allows you and your sister the ability to be patient, loving family and not overwhelmed caregivers. There will always be plenty of things to feel horrible and guilty about. I wish you peace as you take care of your mom.
As others have said, a care facility is the best course of action in many cases. You can find private foster homes (make sure they're properly vetted) where a single caregiver has a handful of patients in a home-esque environment while taking care of their daily needs. 

Don't feel guilty about it - she needs the care and you need the break. Visit her when you can, spend time going over old pictures or listening to old music, but her daily needs are going to drive you or your sister insane before long.
I think the problem with memory care homes has to deal with how humans are. If we are dissatisfied we are more vocal. I refused the idea of having my Dad there. He wanted to be at home and I wanted him to be at home. It gets to a point where it's just not possible for one person to watch out and provide care. Of course every situation is different. My Dad seemed to get more energy combined with being physically capable and sleeping maybe five hours total. The sleeps were just naps in a chair for a couple hours a few times a day. I'm sorry to keep rambling. Where my Dad is now is the best thing for his safety. It's the best thing for his health. The LTC looks clean. The LTC smells clean. Considering everything the carers have been through with COVID and staffing levels I've never sensed or witnessed any negatively. Somehow they have been able to convince Dad to shower and change his clothes, and take his medicine regularly. All things he would say he just did even tho he didn't. He has his own room which is in fact bigger than my own. He has a bathroom in his room. Dad resides on the first floor with trees and grass outside his window. They have some birds in a couple cages and I'm also allowed to bring my dog in when I visit. The last time I asked him if he was happy he said he was, ""very happy"". I always imagined old age would be tv watching and reminiscing between delicious meals. It was. Until it became unsustainable. I was doing this myself so I also had to factor in me. What if all this stress caused a heart attack, what if I was in an accident? There would be no caregiver and my Dad not knowing how to use the phone anymore wouldn't even know where to begin. I could die today and my Dad will still be looked after. I hate this disease and the choices it forces you to make.
I have been struggling with this also OP … personally, I want to keep things at home, but like the others have said … it may be best for our moms to have an objective environment when it gets to the point … I find my emotions can get overwhelming and heated and think “we need someone neutral to do this”, and when those thoughts arise, I think it’s a solid sign to pursue a third part care center (I’m trying to avoid “the home” language, lol).

Your not alone and please keep us updated!
My mom is the same way! She keeps asking where my dad is and he passed 15 years ago. I currently have home healthcare during the day for her but eventually that isn't going to be enough. Things are progressing faster than I would like. I come in solidarity because I completely understand!",2022-03-01 16:49:30,oven-toasted-owl,t4jcj4
Dementia,In-laws disagree with observed symptoms in MIL with severe dementia,,"My DH and I rotate care for my 89-year-old MIL with his two siblings. She has severe dementia with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She came to us with a UTI which we treated and resolved. My SIL has POA and heavily embraces multiple supplements along with MIL’s medications. I have type1 diabetes and experience caring for family members who had Alzheimer’s, so those two things are unfortunately in my wheelhouse. Caring for MIL was exhausting- we encountered the dementia range of behaviors including incontinence and toileting confusion, sundowning, severe anxiety, confusion with her environment and who we were, declining communication, wandering and difficulty with pill swallowing among other things (we cut back on some of the horse pill supplements when she started choking on them). I feel I provided excellent care during that time but was so empty when it was SIL’s turn to take MIL. SIL and BIL think I’m overly focused with her diabetes care, but DH and I feel SIL and BIL are in denial regarding MIL’s status- SIL indicates she doesn’t have problems with meds or toileting but is easily confused (SIL did happen to find a plugged in hair curler under MIL’s bed at her place- it had been plugged in for 5 months since she had MIL last!). We dealt with a very different person when she was with us ( I personally feel SIL minimizes behaviors because she feels MIL will miraculously recover under her care). I know SIL will be expecting business as usual when it comes to our turn again (she hasn’t been planning ahead for when MIL requires advanced care, which we feel will be sooner rather than later). I’m sorry I’m venting but I’m DREADING when it’s our turn again- I know MIL is their parent, but BIL and SIL are sticking their heads in the sand when it comes to their mom’s dementia.",2022-03-01 14:48:34,38willthisdo,t4gj3r
Dementia,Too early to worry?,"My mom is 75. Yesterday my son was speaking to her on the phone. He mentioned that he wasn't feeling well and had not gone to school. Three times during the conversation she asked questions about what happened at school. He kept saying, Grandma... I didn't go to school today. My mom is always been very sharp, and I have never seen this type of behavior in her before. Can things like this just happen occasionally without it being a sign of dementia? I suppose it could just be that she wasn't paying attention to the conversation. Is this something I should question her about it or just let it go for now? I don't want to worry her but I am worried! Thanks.","It could be that she just wasn't paying attention, especially if you have regular, extended contact with her and she doesn't say things like that normally, but I'd be worried too if your contact is more like a phone call once in a while, or if the same thing happens again. Age is definitely a risk factor, but 75 is by no means too young for dementia, and the earlier you know what you're dealing with, the better. Depending on how she might take it, you could start with contacting her PCP directly with your concerns (if you don't know who they are, maybe just ask her under the pretense that you're looking for a good PCP). Beyond that, maybe appeal to her emotions by saying you're a little worried about her and it'd give you peace of mind if she went to the doctor to get checked out (and let the office know ahead of time about your concerns).
It might have been a hearing issue due to the telephone.  Some people can hear fine in person, but for some reason, the telephone distorts things for them.  Hopefully, if she's always all right in person, it's not dementia.
My Mom has dementia, she’s 81, my sister noticed the beginning about 10 years earlier and this is exactly how she started. She had an impressive memory, straight A high school student and after 4 years of college got one B which she’s still mad about. It’s been a slow progression that’s picked up as of late. Getting her tested early and starting medication can slow it down for some immensely. Good luck!
As we age, our memory does decline - dementia is a more rapid decline.  I wouldn’t worry about one incident.  If it becomes a pattern, then I’d get her in to see a doctor.
If your mom has dementia there are probably other things going on too, that you aren't picking up on yet. Two things I can think of are; is she paying her bills and is she taking her medicine. By the time I got involved in my mom's bill paying, she hadn't paid taxes in a year. I just noticed that she was talking about ""all these bills"" more and more, when there weren't any more bills than usual and she never talked about them before. Other behaviors were that she would obsess on piles of mail and lists she made. People with mild dementia have a lot of compensatory behaviors so asking her about it probably won't reveal much. Now that you are looking for indicators, you might recognize things you overlooked before. Good luck with your mom, she's lucky to have you looking out for her.
Tbh I sometimes do that while having conversations and I'm a healthy 30 something year old. If I'm tired or distracted or something I don't retain knowledge that well, so maybe that's the issue she was having.
If she is willing to go get tested, GO.  Go now.

My mom didn't want to go.  If she had, they could have at least slowed things down.",2022-03-01 14:03:12,bingewatchgal,t4fhuk
Dementia,Taking in my dad with Dementia,"I am a married 37f who will most likely be taking in my dad until he can get placement for assisted living or long term care as him living alone isn't helping him to thrive. He doesn't eat enough or drink enough water when left alone. He also sleeps too much and drinks too much coffee during the day. I know this will be a life altering choice and that my life will need to change to accommodate him but I work from home, have no kids and live life pretty much routinely so I think this is a better option.
Anybody have any advice? tips?",">He doesn't eat enough or drink enough water when left alone. He also sleeps too much and drinks too much coffee during the day.

I'd advise you to pick your battles. If he's drinking coffee, at least he's drinking. If it won't actively cause him harm it's far easier to just let him be.

My dad fought with me every single day for two weeks straight about mowing the lawn - something well beyond his physical capabilities most days. Finally the weather was right and he seemed lucid enough for me to allow it (while supervising). He refused to wear real shoes and refused to put a catcher on the mower. After 3 hours, he decided (after suggestion) to take a rest and my partner finished the lawn - it was half done at this point and doesn't take 3h for an able person to do. Getting his way is the only thing that stopped him having a meltdown, and it was at the point that I was losing productivity at work (I also wfh) constantly checking on him to ensure he wasn't into the power tools etc.

Working from home with a demented LO is hard. I hope your bosses are very understanding.

&#x200B;

Edit to add - my partner hates having my dad here. Hopefully yours copes better.
So my dad didnt eat enough or drink enough either.  But I knew I would not be able to stand living with my dad.  If you think this is going to hurt your life or marraige, i suggest doing home automation,  cctv cameras, and safety improvements in his home instead.  An occupational therapist can help with making homes safer for seniors though I had to figure out home automation myself.

It has worked for me.  My dad is back to a decent weight when at one time, he was very underweight. 

You can really watch your dad just as much through cameras as you can with him living with you.  I unplugged the stove so he cant set fire to anything.  I got rid of his metal utensils and knives and replaced them with plastic ones,  Water sensors tell me if he turned on water or left tap on for too long.  You can even set up autoturn off of water with the right installations.  Door sensors tell me if hes leaving his home and a smart speaker tells him not to without one of us being there with him.  Alexa is the one that reminds him to eat, which box color his meal is in, and for how long to microwave his meal (there are smart microwaves you can operate remotely too but my dad doesnt need it). and tells him the whole time hes eating to eat his whole meal.  I have a door sensor on the microwave so know the time he ate and can check on my camera recording at that time to see if he ate his whole meal.  If he didnt, i shove a snack in him later through a phone call and watching him eat his whole snack through the cameras.  95% of the time, he never misses a meal without me even being involved.  Though he only eats his whole meal 60% of the time.  I bumped the calories of each meal up though by using calorically dense foods so he really doesnt need to est the whole thing.  He wasnt doing all the right steps when brushing his teeth either and now that alexa tells him every step, he brushes well enough i dont even need to monitor him.  The speakers i have can detect a fire alarm going off and glass breaking.  A smart thermostat can automate his temporature settings and you can check to see if hes messed up interior temps remotely,

The one safety item that still concerns me is that he has a tub shower instead of just shower.  The occupational therapist suggested a shower bench but he never uses it.  You can have a water valve keep the water turned off and alexa tell him not to shower when you arent there tho if you have this concern too.  He doesnt need to shower every day.

Decaffinated coffee.  Alexa tells him to put on his exercise shoes and do exercise videos every morning.  It turns on the tv and plays the youtube exercise video for him and turns it off when done.  I see my dad doing the videos over the camera recordings.  He does them about 80% of the time which was good enough for me.  A caregiver stops by 5 daya a week and walks with him 1 hour a day so the videos were more to keep him busy.  And frankly, just his exercise videos alone are more exercise than i do lol.
Don't sweat the small stuff; you will have no routine with dementia.
Sometimes with drinking, it is just having it accessible and watching someone else drink. We do that with my Grandma. Sometimes it works well. I hold my cup and drink and she realizes she can drink from her glass too. 
I also got her a bent silicone milkshake straw. That seemed to help her drink easier. She draws up more fluid at a time. Drinking is hit or miss. Try different flavored drink drops.
If he takes meds you may want to keep them in a separate spot and only provide them when it is time to take them. My grandma began taking too many of her meds because she would forget she already took them. It also guarantees she drinks her milk at least twice a day since she gets a glass in the morning and at night.

You will definitely have an adjustment period. But routine helps with that IMO. He may be very angry. My grandma was towards me. She made lots of verbal threats. I think she was grieving for the loss of her independence and a lot of frustration over the whole changing dynamic of our relationship. But she couldn't verbalize it well. One moment she would yell... An hour later we were fine and she was laughing. It can be very Jekyll/Hyde. I spent a lot of time crying and mourning who she was and who I now had to deal with. Just remember to be kind to yourself and remove yourself if you get overwhelmed. It can be a lot.
If you involve the government, you can forget about an inheritance.  Medicaid will take $15,000 per month until he is penniless.  All social security except $100 will be seized.

This sounds modest.  Be firm with what he cannot do, but give him something to do.  I got my patents a dachshund puppy, and it is something that keeps them active.  Depending on where you are, the local senior center is an excellent choice.  

Dementia is more often caused by loneliness, lack of purpose, and drugs.  Seemingly innocuous OTC drugs like Benadryl or PM meds can cause dementia.  Hydrocortisone is a major cause of aggression. Common prescription drugs like benzos cause amnesia at a much higher rate for many people.

My mother had rapid onset dementia after an entirely unnecessary foot surgery at 74.  Local anesthetics can cause serious dementia. The number of prescription drugs she was taking that cause dementia was staggering. 

I bought a three-family house, got full power of Attorney, and ensure they eat a healthy diet and strictly monitor what drugs they are taking, and take them to all doctors appointments, which are few since I got them both off needless medication and changed their diet.  

Whatever you do, understand medicine in this country is about profit not wellness.  Your parents should not go under for surgery unless its life or death.  Doctors hand out drugs needlessly all the time.  Or the wrong ones.

Blood pressure is the most important.  Beta blockers don't have much clinical evidence of success in the elderly and make them tired.  ARB2 blockers don't affect capillaries in the brain or work as well as ACE inhibitors.  The latter are often discouraged because of a minor cough.  They work the best however.  There is growing evidence that drugs like Viagra significantly improve dementia symptoms as they dilate capillaries in the brain.   

Be proactive, understanding, and don't be afraid to use Meals on Wheels or take them to a senior center.  I'm alone in my struggle and have made a real difference in my parents' lives.  Think about what you can do before you put them in a nursing home or assisted living facility.  You may regret it once they are gone.
Sorry you're faced with this decision. 

I had to replace my mum's tea with decaf, maybe you could do the same with the coffee? 

Good luck with the rest. It's not an easy decision to make.
1. Try not to argue or reason with him. He's losing the capacity for reason. Find subtler and more manipulative ways to deal with him. It might feel like lying, but it's really the only way to keep them calm and happy.
2. Find help. It's good that you're looking for a facility, but until then, depending on how his dementia goes, it'll probably really help you to have an aide come in at least a little. That'll be extra helpful when it comes to bathing. It's really common for folks with dementia to a) lose all interest in hygiene and b) fight family caregivers who try to provide hygiene help. But they're often a lot more cooperative with nurses and aides.
3. If there's an 'adult day care' (I hate that name) near you, consider coaxing him into it. The social interaction and activities will keep him engaged and do him good.
4. Night-time restlessness is a huge, huge issue for a lot of families. We have to sleep, but our demented LOs often get worse at night and have wacky sleeping patterns that both make them worse cognitively (anyone gets foggy if they're barely sleeping at night) and disrupt the rest of the household's sleep. Really push for finding routines and, if necessary, meds to get him to sleep through the night, for his sanity and yours.
Watch Teepa Snow videos.  She has a whole series of YT vids on various aspects of dementia.  She’s amazing and they’re very helpful.
I'm in an identical situation to you about 6 months in taking care of my mom.  

I find setting up a routine helps, meals at certain times, walks if possible, making sure they have access to what they like in my case it's tv for my mom. 

As mentioned already by others pick your battles I let most things go or slide unless it's related to bathing once a week, changing her diapers when needed and appointments. If she want to eat lunch at 11 instead of 12, no biggie, if she gets up at 10PM and thinks it's the next day and wants to make coffee, I'll bring her a sleep time tea instead and tell her this is better than coffee, and one of her favorite treats. But if she becomes adamant about coffee at night, I let her win that one.   My mother was a big all day caffeine drinker, I let her have coffee in the morning but switched her to herbal teas for the rest of the day. Also get a big container of Metamucil and give him a glass of that with his breakfast in the morning, it makes taking care of accidents much easier. 

She goes to bed early, but can get up a couple of times a night to have a smoke outside but otherwise sleeps through to the morning. 

You will get annoyed, and it's ok. Some days will be easier than others, don't be hard on yourself, self-care is important so if you have a family member that can help and offers it, take what you can.  If you're a patient person by nature this is going to help tremendously, tone of voice also helps when communicating when trying to get them to do something they don't want to, and psychically leading them gently while being calm. 

I have a sibling that helps out once a month by taking her for a couple of nights, my hardest days I tell myself - ""this is temporary, long but temporary hang in there - one day at a time""",2022-03-01 12:01:13,fireontheinside,t4cmau
Dementia,When to pull the plug and relocate parent or parents,"TLDR: My parents live across the country. I don’t know how to assess whether keeping things that way is sustainable. 

In the last 6mo my mom has had rapid onset of dementia, and needs full time care. My dad tried to be the caregiver, which lead to a deep depression.  I come to stay for a few weeks, established 24h care at home. I know we’re lucky we can do that. It goes relatively smoothly - my mom is not the easiest person so there’s always the occasional period where she’s upset, and at times we have to indulge bad habits like eating less than healthy food to keep the peace. But she’s generally accepting of care. I am managing all the scheduling and payments for care. My hope was to take the worry away from my dad so he could return to a normal life. He sleeps in a different room now. He has a local support network (family, friends) while my mom not so much.

I flew back thinking we’d gotten to a good new structure. A few weeks later my dad had a nervous breakdown. He was having trouble concentrating at his job, at home he was depressed, not seeing friends, etc… Even with care the whole situation is sad/stressful and the house can feel oppressive. He left the house and is in intensive therapy while staying away from the house. I had to fly back and coordinate that as well. A few weeks into the process and he doesn’t seem that much better. We’re not sure exactly when he should return home. I’m worried we’ll reintroduce him, and he’ll fall apart again.

But I can’t stay here forever and can’t keep flying back every few weeks on a new crisis. 

It would be very distributive for them and myself but one option is to move my mom across the country to live with me and my family and find local care here. I just don’t know how to think through that option. Having a working system where they live now would be a lot better for them I think. I’m not sure what’s the tipping point to make us execute on such a drastic change.

Have others here had similar experience or just generally have advice?","Your dad’s present is my future. To hopefully avoid what he is going through, I have already decided to place my husband in a care facility when the time comes. I will be able to visit him and do what I can to help him, but I will be able to continue working and hopefully thriving. Having full time care in my home would be good for my husband but not for me. I assume that’s how it is for your dad. Since I would not want my husband living across the country from me being taken care of by my child, I would recommend you look for a care facility placement near your dad.
Before moving her, I would HIGHLY recommend that everything is arranged. Moving for dementia patients can be very difficult. Whether she lives with you or in a nursing home. My grandma “rotated” between my aunt and my mom’s before going to her nursing home. Both of her rooms in each home had similar items and layout to try to help with the confusion. Is sounds like your mom is a bit more progressed than my grandma but any thing you can do to help be proactive with the move will be absolutely worth it. 

When my grandma moved into her nursing home, my aunt hired movers and they handled everything and then my grandma got there and provided director on what to hang on the walls and some interior design so she felt included. But she wasn’t involved with actual move since she has started to accuse people of stealing items and seeing shadow people. 

I would also suggest looking at your VS your dad’s state to see what has better nursing home/healthcare ratings across the board. My grandma is in NJ but one of her sons wanted her to stay in Missouri but NJ has a much higher standard of care. (which also equates to much much higher prices)

Good luck with your mom and I hope for the best.
Going back to the same arrangement that didn't work before should be taken off your list of options. It only gets worse. Your intention was good, but expecting your Dad to ""return to a normal life"" once caregivers were hired was unrealistic and ignorant of the reality of having a spouse with dementia.

The important question is whether your Dad wants to move where you live?  Would he want to give up what he has in his current location and create roots and a new life in your city?  

Another consideration is whether your Dad will be a successful ""point person"" if your Mom is living in a facility (regardless of the city)? Will he be the one making decisions, going to the ER, talking to the doctors, advocating for good care?  That person needs to be in close proximity to your Mom, imo. If not possible, then hiring a geriatric care manager in your Mom's city could help bridge the gap.
imagine if she were to live (with a lot of needs and support; but, still, live) for 10 more years. I am sure you don’t want to drain your dad’s bank account entirely and leave him healthy but in total poverty for potentially 15 years beyond that. I would definitely run numbers and compare the states’ laws on spousal refusal and spousal impoverishment protection.

I am just getting started down this path so my input might not count for much. My dad is a difficult person and always was. There is no one to care for him but me. So two months ago I flew down, packed a few bags for him, shut off the water, locked the doors, forwarded his mail and drove him home with me. He thinks he's visiting. The problem is and I hope you don't find this to be the case but you might, what I thought was a pretty mild case of dementia turns out to be far more severe than I could ever have imagined. I noticed it as soon as we left his comfort zone and all his familiar routines. Either those things were propping him up, or just helping him cover. It's been horrendously difficult personally, and I'm just trying to get through one day at a time with a lot of prayer. But it's something you should consider... Moving her might make the dementia so much more apparent.
I am going through this right now and my dad lives in the same city as me! but at the end of the day you have to consider whats best for the individual and let them have a say in their living arrangements. Have you asked your mom what she wants?
I've helped quite a few people through this given my profession as an occupational therapist. When it gets to be unmanageable or unreasonable is usually when it is best to call it quits. I think it is best to have an honest conversation with everybody involved and try and establish some type of quality of life. Hire professional help if needed to keep your loved ones safe at home, as it is often cheaper than putting somebody in a nursing home. Plus, everybody has peace of mind that way as well.",2022-03-01 09:08:52,-emanresUesoohC-,t48q4c
Dementia,Just want to vent,"Hello, I am from the Philippines. I just wanted to ask help/vent regarding my 88 year old grandma who is now in the onslaught of dementia. 

I actually struggle a lot with her presence in our house. She smokes a lot, and this is all she thinks about every day. My father, mom and sister have weak lungs and this has been a struggle daily. My grandma insists on going out for hours on end, and she gets lost that we have to find her. I could not believe that this is the same grandma that read me bedtime stories and cooked delicious food. Now, I am seeing unpleasant parts from her. She becomes selfish, bitter, and thinks people owe their success to her. She brings back garbage from other people's houses. She backstabs her sister..she has a nasty tongue. Since she already forgets how she manages her money and when it's gone (from buying cigarettes), she blames.my mother. She also has a big sense of entitlement. This was shocking to me. She expects to be always prioritized and her wishes granted, from food to everything. 

We are currently in a tight financial spot and cannot afford any nursing homes at the moment. Nursing care here is EXPENSIVE. Nursing homes for elders is also not a prevalent idea here in the Philippines where caring for elders is deeply embedded in our culture. She cannot also stay with her other children because the condition of their houses is not fit for taking care of someone with dementia. 

:( How do you deal with this? My family, esp my mom, struggles a lot. Every day we have stress from just dealing with her.","My grandpa is the same way about smoking! I personally want to take the cigarettes away. I’m tired of worrying that he’ll burn the house down.
> She smokes a lot, and this is all she thinks about every day.  

I completely relate and sympathize with you on this point. My 78-yr old mother is obsessed with cigarettes. She was an apologetic and considerate smoker her whole life, always trying to hide the filthy habit, but in her dementia she has been reduced to a sniveling Gollum. She wanders around the house all day re-checking pockets and drawers for her precious cigarettes. She cries when her husband tries to limit her smoking, and she whines when she thinks she's lost her cigs or lighter. Her typical response when I say ""good morning"" is ""I can't find my cigarettes.""  

I despise tobacco companies for pushing this addiction on her, and it's difficult for me not to despise my own mother for how this habit has taken over her formerly lovely personality.
&#x200B;

Ohh, TrickAd, so very sorry - it's really hard, I feel for you & family!    Yes, unfortunately, many people with dementia the disease changes their personality - lovely sweet kind funny people turn nasty rude selfish uncooperative difficult, also even abusive - very sad, wearisome & painful for family/carers.

Have you checked out the websites of English-language speaking countries dementia .org and alzheimers .org?   They have tons of information about memory-loss diseases & issues, resources, tips, techniques, strategies for management of behaviours & so on.  Also for support & self-care for the carers etc.

There are also facebook groups for carers support.  Maybe join this one?   It's not such an enormous group, but maybe sometimes it could help you find management strategies or tips - there must be other larger groups from other countries, idk.  [https://www.facebook.com/groups/dementiadownunder/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dementiadownunder/)

Yeh, some countries eg USA they also apparently don't have govt state-paid nursing homes until at least not until a certain point, I think.   Makes great difficulties for many people.  So sorry TrickAd, hope you & yr mom find some relief & solutions.  Best of luck!

Dementia,Advice for consoling grandma with dementia,"I see my 93 year old grandma once or twice a week to spend time with her. She is still with it enough to know her brain isn’t doing well (forgetting important dates when she used to be a walking calendar, difficulty remembering words and conversations, inability to remember who is who and who has visited her). She’s stressed about this, independently verbalizes her brain isn’t good and gets upset over this. I don’t know how to approach this topic with her. For what it’s worth she’s in independent living with a live in helper.","If she's still pretty with it you could suggest that she and her helper keep a calendar/diary where she can note down upcoming events and write what she did each day and who visited her.  That way, when she's confused she can refer to the diary.
If she isn’t taking anything for anxiety, I would talk to her doctor about that. My husband has been taking something since his diagnosis.",2022-02-28 23:45:24,girl-of-beavers,t3zlgm
Dementia,I think my dad is showing signs of dementia,Hello so recently I’ve been going to the grocery store with my dad a lot and he’s always telling me that he thought he saw someone we know for example he would say “ I thought I saw Jim’s daughter” other times he would say “I thought I saw Jim’s wife” and even when I didn’t go to the grocery store with him he would always think he saw someone he knows. He also Forgets a lot of things like he would say who put this here and I would have to tell him That he did. Maybe I’m over exaggerating please let me know what you all think,Encourage him to get a check up.  It could be so many things.  I wouldn't jump straight to dementia.,2022-02-28 20:41:42,zayybo,t3vxlp
Dementia,Worried about my father,"We're in the process of moving closer to my (50F) father (75) and in the process of buying a house in their neighborhood, so talking a great deal about houses and so forth. My husband is staying with my parents while he works and goes house hunting with them. I'm across the US and packing up here, so dealing with things has been rather epically insane. 

Unfortunately, we're starting to notice some bizarre behaviors in my father - he's using racist language he's NEVER used in his life (note: our daughter is mixed race), including dropping the N word, (""I don't mind living in a neighborhood with Ns"") asking the same question dozens of times over the course of days (""how much are you paying your realtor?"" note: my cousin, his niece) and today we had a conference call where he was CONFUSED for an hour and a half over simple things like WHY we had to put 10% down for a mortgage, how long a term of a mortgage we were getting, and making dozens of demands about our financial future that have NOTHING to do with him and aren't his business (""I'm just concerned about cash flow!"") They literally wrote everything down for him about the buying of the house there, selling of the house here and he STILL kept asking the same questions in this phone call! And he got angry about it. I recommended we all step away from the call, as 3 of us understood the situation and he needed time to review things. And yup, I made him even angrier with that.

Folks, this is our 4th house. He's NEVER shown any interest in our finances. Two weeks ago he asked if I was married (yup, 17 years to my veteran husband). He was also confused as to my legal name (I never changed my name when I married, so my legal name is HIS last name). 

He's always been stubborn and self-centered, but somehow this has become much worse lately. Honestly, I've likely just been blaming this sort of thing on his personality until now. But I'm not thinking that anymore! 

I don't even KNOW how to deal with him, much less have a conversation with my mother (75). Part of us moving there is to help them as they age, so this is rather startling to say the least.","This does sound worrisome. I would first start with your mom once you get there and have a private conversation. Ask her if the doctor has said anything about his memory/personality/cognitive changes. Your dad may already have a diagnosis and your mom is either in denial or just hasn’t wanted to tell you about it. Such secrecy/denial doesn’t help, of course, but often people don’t want to admit what is right there in front of them. If he doesn’t have a diagnosis, you need to talk your mom into bringing this up to the doctor or you will need to get word to the doctor yourself. This could be something treatable and not dementia at all. Ignoring it could mean he (and all of you) suffers needlessly.
One of the first things I noticed about my dad's behavior is that he started saying things I NEVER heard him say before. We were watching tv and Paris Hilton came on and he called her a ""slut."" OMG, my dad NEVER called any woman a ""slut."" He was always very quiet, reserved but a jokester too, usually very harmless type of jokes, but then he started talking, talking, talking all the time, no filter, just verbal diarrhea, and progressed to frequent nasty, perverted jokes. Unfortunately, my dad's primary care doctor was also a good buddy of his from military days, and I feel like his doctor didn't treat my dad like a patient. Supposedly, my dad brought up to him concerns regarding dementia, because I kept pestering him to bring it up, and his doctor said, ""Oh, no! You have a better memory than me!"" And, my dad used this to justify not pursuing it further. My dad was in so much denial, but then he got into a car accident, nearly killed a guy on a motorcycle. I insisted on going to my dad's appointment with a new primary care doctor (his old buddy doc had finally retired), and wrote a letter to the doctor with my observations and concerns and the doctor was able to get a referal to a neurologist who confirmed the dementia diagnosis. My advice is to push it, push it now rather than later. Earlier treatment might have mitigated some of the symptoms and he would have had a greater quality of life, had we known sooner.",2022-02-28 19:36:12,NoeTellusom,t3um3v
Dementia,Mom is saying she feels rage occasionally for no reason...,"My mom says sometimes she will wake up in the middle of the night and feel absolute rage and says she wants to punch a pillow or throw something. This also happens randomly throughout the day and seems to be becoming more frequent. Is this a symptom of dementia? I ask because she keeps saying she's being over medicated, I'm not sure if the medication could be causing it or if it's normal for a dementia patient.","Are you able to talk to her doctor? When my grandmother started getting like this, we spoke with her doctor and they put her on the Prozac patch, telling her that it sounded like she was on ""too many heart meds"" so she didn't realize what was happening.

It helped tremendously.
Hey, anger can be a sign of depression too. Talk it over with her doctor, explore every possibility.",2022-02-28 19:31:24,Anticrepuscular_Ray,t3uikn
Dementia,bonding with a grandparent with dementia,"I was wondering if anyone had any creative ideas on how to bond with someone with dementia? I’m 21 and my grandma is 91 and she’s been developing dementia during covid. During this time I was going through a deep depression and in turn didn’t spend much time with much family, which I now deeply regret. My grandma doesn’t really want to leave the house so I’ve been trying to think of some interesting activities I could do with her indoors. So far I’ve ordered some puzzles (big piece 500 count ones), and some note cards. As I’ve been regaining my will to live and trying to get my shit together I realized there are a lot of life milestones I’ll reach that someday i won’t be able to share with my grandma. She used to sew, which inspired me to pursue fashion design, so I wanted to get her creative again as a thank you. On one side of the blank notecards asking her to draw a flower, then asking her to on the other side write down what she’d say to me when I’d *insert life milestone here*. 

Sharing this to maybe give someone else a bonding idea! And if anyone has any other ideas please share :)","That’s so great that you are looking for opportunities to bond with your grandma now.  Indoor activities I enjoy with my father who is in early stages - playing cribbage (card game), baking, watching old shows (golden girls).  Outdoor activities - taking him for a drive to familiar spots, going for short walks, sitting by the duck pond. I think the biggest thing is to remember that your time together does not have to be anything grand and that you just need to be her in space. If she enjoyed sewing there might be some simple sewing things she could do or ones aimed towards children to teach them to sew.
You are awesome! Will she manage seeing ok with the puzzle? I also bought a few 500 piece ones and found out they’re too small for my mom (83). Music is a big thing helping them to be present and content as well! All the best to you dear - you are a lovely young person and btw, try not to be so hard on yourself! It certainly is difficult to navigate the world these days, I couldn’t imagine how it is for younger folks.
If you have old family photos she might enjoy going through them, and it could spark memories of who people in the photos are, as well as memories that are more accessible to her than short term. Family history is great firsthand. 

All of the other suggestions are great. My Mum has really been furiously crocheting blankets for Project Linus, she enjoys choosing the colors and arranging the blankets. 

Mum also enjoys time with our cat and walking the dog, we try to let her make decisions where she still can. She likes a routine, too. 

You may find some other suggestions on the Alzheimer’s Association website. Wishing you peace along this journey.
Ask her about her early life. What was it like when she was your age. Write down her history and stories while she can remember them. Play board games that are old school. Look at photo albums together
Is she able to communicate? If so, ask her about her childhood and young adulthood. If not, maybe ask your mom or dad to write down stories she told them from back then and then you guys can read them together and reminisce.
My grandma likes those springbok jigsaw puzzles. She can only do up to a hundred piece, and I have to do the border first, but she gets it done if I help out a bit. Depending on how far along she is, you could do latch hook kits. I have to show my grandma how to do the first one in a row, but it's time spent and there's a finished product at the end.

She also likes to watercolor in a coloring book.

Oh and if you decide to do the 500pc and it seems like it's above her skill level, you can have her sort the pieces while you put it together. My grandma just likes to watch sometimes. And get one of those puzzle mats so you can roll it up if you don't finish and need the space.",2022-02-28 17:46:11,bigtimestupididiot,t3s878
Dementia,Bizarre delusions stated as fact,"As the title says, my mother is making bizarre statements as though they are fact that are clearly delusions. Is this typical for early stage dementia?

Example: mother has decided that the reason she doesn’t like her new condo is because, “ it is built on the earth”. When I explain that all homes are and every home she has ever lived in has been built on the earth, she goes on about, “NOT ME! I NEVER live on the earth! I’m always one level or more above.”

Completely false. She lived in a house in San Francisco built over a garage as a child, and a townhome set up similarly in the last few years. Every other home has been, “on the earth.” 

Thoughts on this bizarre statement that she swears is fact? 


She has made similar claims recently regarding homes with windows or high wind areas…. That she somehow has never lived in such situations previously.

Is this a dementia thing? She is so matter of fact about it and can seem so lucid otherwise.","This is the sort of thing that there is no point at all in arguing about.  It's often impossible to understand exactly what they mean so just asking them something like ""Oh really, what is that like"" or ""How does that make you feel"" can help you understand what they are trying to express.  Trying to argue them back into our world is frustrating for you both and a waste of time.  They are trying to express the sense of loss and displacement they are feeling without the vocabulary to do so.  My father told me once in a period of lucidity early on that he felt he'd become unanchored from his brain and couldn't trust anything he felt, thought, or saw.  He compared it to when he lost oxygen back when he flew during the war.
Yes, my wife’s delusions and conspiracy theories grew over time. Along with the anger and belligerence which to the point we had to physically restrain her. Common antipsychotics prescribed by her psychiatrist made her much more manageable. The delusions and conspiracy theories have not gone away, but now she having a quiet constant dialogue on the problems in her little world.
In my experience, yeah, bizarre statements happen a lot. I could never tell, with my dad, whether he literally meant whatever bizarre thing he said or whether he was just using the wrong words to convey a relatively sane concept.
My dad's delusions sometimes are based on things/sometimes traumas that happened in childhood. It's almost like things that upset him years ago now resurface and form delusions.
Many times people with dementia cannot find the correct words to convey what they are trying to say, so they will use others. Sometimes my Mum will make up stories to fill in things that she doesn’t remember, too. They don’t realize that they are doing it, and won’t remember it, either. 

If she is getting agitated, her team can titrate her medication to try to calm her down. Each case is different, but there are recurring themes. The Alzheimer’s Association has a lot of resources for family and caregivers, and a social worker could help with available services.
Yes experiencing this too. Sounds like she is trying to express something valid but based on a select memory and grasping for the vocabulary to do so. E.g never lived on earth.... Does she mean ground floor in those places you mentioned? Similar to what other posters said, don't bother arguing, ask her to describe more about that, how she feels etc.
I'm not a doctor or medical professional so I obviously cannot say anything for sure.  However, it does sound like there has been a change in her mental abilities which are causing her difficulty in communication. This can be for a multitude of reasons; infection, stroke, dementia, vitamin deficiency, dehydration.....regardless, a change in cognitive function like this should be brought up to a doctor asap. 

On a personal level, when I read your post my mind immediately wanted to ask you ""Is her new apartment on the ground floor?"" YOu stated that she has always lived in places that were not first floor housing, a condo above a garage and a townhome....both are ""above earth"" if you get what I'm saying. If that's the case, it seems like she's might not be delusional and more that she cannot find the words to communicate ""ground floor"" and instead replaces it with ""on earth"". This is a common sign of dementia but it isn't a definitive hallmark of ONLY dementia. Hence why I recommend getting her in to see a doc ASAP.  

I hope everything turns out ok and am sending you all the positivity I've got.
Absolutely part of the dementia thing in my experience. My husband does the same thing. He also swears I haven’t taken him to the doctor when we just went a week ago or that or that I told him XYZ when I’ve never said anything remotely like that. 
As you are learning, there’s no  point in trying to argue logic or truth. . Logic and truth no longer exist within dementia world. I just say something like “ oh is that right…interesting” or whatever and let it go. Contradicting them gets them agitated and upset and there’s no point.
I would just tell dad he had a medical appointment and then say I will be over on X at 10 and pick you up. When it was factual, there wouldn’t be fight about appt. Usually told him it was general check up for his meds. 

Your mom might be needing some meds or have UTI which can also cause delusional behaviors.
Look up Teepa Snow, she’s on tiktok and I think YouTube. She is a specialist in Dementia/Alzheimer’s care and techniques for dealing with this sort of thing. How to handle situations where the person is delusional, angry, upset, etc. basically you have to go along with it and not correct them (they won’t ever “learn” or realize they’re having a delusion), and come up with creative ways to guide their attention to something else. As long as they’re not telling stories to a doctor or police officer or something in a way that could endanger their health or safety, there’s nothing you can really do other than say “Oh that’s interesting. Would you like pasta or soup for dinner?”
Generally you are way better off taking this as a serious concern that isn't literally true. Something is triggering her and your goal is to try to put her at ease or to identify and remove the trigger. Sometimes this is as simple as kindly redirecting and changing the subject. Sometimes you can manage it by removing some source of stimuli. Sometimes your best move is to just start very theatrically smashing those god damned invisible snakes that keep bothering your loved one.

In case you haven't pursued it, maybe try to get an example of the thing bothering her or see if she can talk about a place that she preferred and why. Good luck.
My mother lives in the land of make belief. She has Lewy Body Dementia and it’s a living hell...! Hallucinations 24/7... the meds only work maybe 50% of the time!! 🥵😢
 Dad had some vivid and wild hallucinations to the point that when we called, he would report he was stuck in the dentist's office when you could hear the usual announcements from the home in the background.  He'd also regularly report he was arrested and in jail for an argument with the staff when they'd report he was a sweetheart.  

They worked on balancing his meds and got rid of the wild hallucinations, but he still has some convincing and vivid encounters with an imaginary staff member who steals things, doesn't serve him his food, and doesn't give him his mail.  There is no use arguing against it because this delusion is so deeply rooted that you'll never convince him otherwise.  

The only way we've found to handle it with the least stress on everyone is to just let him talk about it and change the subject as quickly as we can.  Sometimes, we'll have to tell him that we will ""check on it"" to settle him down, but he'll forget that pretty quickly, just as he'll forget the delusion quickly.
My wife believed animals were in our condo and that our grandkids were outside looking for her.  She believes her brother had his legs amputated.  Her doctor prescribed her 25 ml of Seroquel at bedtime and as needed during the day.  The hallucinations and delusions stopped within  a day and her condition vastly improved.",2022-02-28 12:27:44,GenXKaren,t3ktzq
Dementia,I'm tired.,"Just a vent. I cant talk to people in RL so internet strangers it is.

I work full time, I have a business to run, and with COVID, it's been real tough. 
We also take care of our grandmother who has dementia and we have people who help, but she can be so abusive that we have to be present all the time to calm her down.
I am so tired. I feel stagnant, my days are not progressive because I lack sleep. The stress of maintaining the business and sustaining my family is really getting to me. 

She doesn't sleep. She wants to go to the bathroom all the time. Especially if she has an episode, she'll go every second. 
We'll prepare for her to go back to bed and once on the bed, she'll argue to go bathroom.
She needs the assistance to take her because she's so weak from the lack of sleep and just overall she's at that age. 
She refuses to wear diapers. 
Shes so mean, and when she doesn't get her way - the guilt tripping is so heartbreaking. She says the most vile things and I don't recognize her anymore. 

I'm on the edge, I'm so done. Im trying to be mentally tough, but I'm tired of being tough too. It's been the most hellish 3 years of my life and this is the cherry on top. 

I'm 23 and I feel so stagnant, so hopeless, exhausted and just about done. 
It's 2am and I'm at my wits end. I have to leave the to breathe.
I don't have the heart to argue with her. 

I'm just. Done.","Try the ones that look like underwear.  We have very recently started these with my MIL who lives with us, having the pretty pattern is helpful.  If you can get two colours even better.

I agree with looking into a home and definitely medication.  And does she drink a lot of coffee or tea?  It may be time to mix in decaf.  I think the caffeine is probably helpful for sharper, clearer thinking, but it also increases agitation and obviously disturbs sleep.  And is a diuretic too.
So sorry, coconut, that's really hard, I feel for you!  All the tough work and stress with this danged pandemic on top, it's a lot.  I hope y'all can find some solutions to help ease things somewhat, sounds like you really need at least a bit of respite.  Hang in there, best of luck!
Have you taken her to see a urologist??? There are medications she can take that suppress an over active nerve in her bladder
Hey, Coconut, I'm going through a pretty similar situation to yours and I'm sorry to hear you're going through this, especially at such a young age. 

This issue sounds really similar to my grandmother's behavioural and overall manic episodes that concided with her having an UTI. Once we got her on a set of antibiotics the behavioural episodes and constant bathroom trips significantly decreased and sleeping at night became a bit easier for everyone involved. Melatonin at bedtime also seemed to help.
I’m sorry you’re dealing with all of that. Is your Grandmother on medication? They should be able to calm down the abuse and give her something so she will sleep. 

My husband doesn’t wear diapers yet but I was advised to remove all of his underwear and fill his drawer with Depends. 

Can you place her in a memory care facility? It sounds like it’s time. Please don’t feel guilty about considering this option. At least, visit a few and get the paperwork done so you can place her. For example, my husband had to have a tuberculosis test and his doctor had to fill out some paperwork. 

You can also consider placing her for a week or two so you get a break. During that time while she’s in a MC facility, they might be able to adjust her meds.
I’m so sorry you are going through this right now. It’s so hard when they are nasty. Can you talk to her Dr about medication changes?  

I’m sending you lots of internet hugs
This is EXACTLY like my dad.  He will not wear pullups and gets up every 20 minutes at night to go to the bathroom.  My poor mom is at her wits end, because she has to help him to the bathroom because he can't do it himself.  He is taking 3 different kinds of sleeping pills and nothing is working.
When mom’s Alz was in full swing she was on this schedule:  Times mom got up 5/14/18
PM 9:19, 9:50, 10:25, 10:40, 11:42, 11:52, 12:04, 12:20, 12:27, 12:33, 1:19, 3:28, 3:44, 3:50, 3:57, 4:19,  5:48, 6:54 am up for the day.

I wrote those times down to show her doc but… not much help. 

A couple weeks later she was bedfast. 

OP my heart goes out to your family. Hope you get some rest along the way.  We hear you.
I see you, tired person. I am also exhausted. Definitely look into medication. It’s also worth checking for a UTI. If you can, hire a night nurse, even if it’s just for a few days; you need to sleep ❤️",2022-02-28 08:27:01,Coconut12398,t3fla5
Dementia,Dementia and frailty.....,"Hello all caretakers, or maybe also dementia sufferers, if there are any reading.

I wonder what is your experience with frailty? You know, falling when walking, being very weak, weak hands, not many muscles, having big difficulties getting up from the floor or ground etc.

Is it always a part of dementia? Can it be reversed with improving diet and exercise?

What is the bext management strategy for frailty?","I'm not sure if it's normal, but it is in our case. 
But it could also be just because of her age, she's 86.
Shes always been ok with walking, she's still walks from time to time, but we've had to assist her as she's actually fallen before.

She just walks and then all of a sudden drops. 
Shes also had a few cases of vertigo.
Hope that helps
I imagine some has to do with the medication. My grandma recently got put in a nursing home where the doctor upped her meds and she’s been confused and going downhill ever since being there. Two months ago she was walking fine and now she’s been falling and bruising. A week and a half ago she fell and broke her hip and her shoulder. Before then the nurses had to loosely restrain her to her chair when she ate because she’s very hyper and would make herself fall off and bruise. I think it’s fairly common but like the other poster, I think it also has something to do with age. She’s 88 now.
So my grandma went to PT for a bit since her last major fall resulted in hip fracture. 

The issue has become her spatial awareness is really bad so she doesn’t realize where her body is on relation to space. She also forgets to close drawers and such so she trips over those, legs on chairs, ect. 

I think part of it could be dementia but im a huge advocate for diet and exercise. Def consult with a doctor prior to changing diet or adding an exercise. I had an aunt who is “certified in keto nutrition” (she did those short online courses that let you be certified) and decided that diet would work for my grandma simply because it works for her. Obviously that’s not the way you should go about changing the diet of a 70+ year old so this resulted in her having kidney stones and having the keto flu for about a month.
My dads doctor referred us to a physical therapist who in turn gave him a bunch of balancing and strengthening excerises to do with him. 

My dad doesnt have fraility problems yet though.  It was more precautionary for us.
I work with people with dementia in their homes and from what I've seen frailty seems to always come along eventually. Eventually the brain has a hard time communicating with the body and vice versa which leads to balance and spatial awareness issues too.",2022-02-28 05:24:07,TigerGuy40,t3cig0
Dementia,Lost my grandma to vascular dementia,"I lost my grandma to vascular dementia a few days ago. I know she is in a better place because past few months she couldn't do anything and was entirely dependent on others and bedridden. I have always seen her being ill (she had a lot of health issues). She lived a long life, she was 90. She saw her great-grandson become an adult. But past few years we had been living together. The person I knew was long before she was physically gone. But there's this pain and hurt and grief in me and I don't know what to do or how to process it. Worst is, I'm all alone. I am an international student, I have been in a different country for the past few months and couldn't see her or be with her at the end. My entire family is back home. I have no friends here and no social support system whatsoever. And I miss her, even though we didn't do any 'special' things together. But all those tiny moments throughout the day made up for it - like her chair in my mom's room, giving her a bath, watching a movie with her at home every nye instead of going out, making her wear her hearing aid, lending my scarves to her because she liked them, her watching movies on my laptop with me, her making me try on her jewelry and forty year old clothes. How can I honor her memories? How does one cope with this?","I’m so sorry. I lost my grandmother to vascular dementia in 2014, and I can relate to how you feel. Things that helped me included documenting memories in a journal or with pictures. I cook her favorite foods on her birthday each year and make dessert for her, eating them myself, but putting a plate for her too. Grief takes time to work through and it is not linear.

My heart goes out to you. Toast her and never forget. Hugs.
I am sorry to hear about your grandmother. It will get better one day for sure!

One thing that has helped me with loss, is to reflect and remind myself of the things I still have. I try to practice a lot of gratitude to help with my grief. I may have loss my father, but I am grateful I have my siblings and mother in good health. I'm grateful I have this opportunity to be in school. I am grateful I'm not in Ukraine with bombs flying over me. I'm grateful I have a place to sleep tonight. It may sound a bit silly, but it worked for me! There may be a lot of depressing/stressful things happening, but there's always something to be grateful for.

Yes, your grandmother is in a better place, and she reached 90 years! That is amazing. Even though her last years may have been hard to watch, one may also be grateful that she lived such an amazing long life! And with such a loving family, with you included. Despite the hard times, she is very fortunate. This is one example of how I would try to be grateful. It may be hard at first, and maybe it won't work for you, but maybe it will. Writing down a list of all the things you are grateful for, and reading your list every morning helps!

It is normal to be sad, and it is normal to embrace it. If you need to cry that is totally alright! I think creating a diary is also a great idea.

Dementia,I don’t want to have sex with my husband,"Ok…I know this is super personal. I just don’t feel comfortable talking about this with my friends. Internet strangers it is. 

My husband has early onset FTD. We are still fairly young. He’s only 59. I’m 10 years younger. He is not the same person. His personality has changed significantly which is a symptom of his kind of dementia. 
Between that and the fact that I am basically a caretaker/ mom role for him these days, I just do not feel even slightly sexual towards him any longer. Don’t get me wrong. I love this man with my whole heart. He is the love of my life and my best friend…or was…but I just can’t. 
He has been wanting intimacy and I keep putting him off. Usually he forgets for a while until the next time it comes up. I really just can’t. No matter how much I love him I just do not feel sexual about him any longer. I can’t bring myself to have what would basically be pity sex. The idea of it just makes me…ugh. No. I just can’t. And I feel like I shouldn’t have to either. 
I feel horrible for feeling this way. None of this is his fault. It feels wrong to force him into celibacy when we previously had an active love life. But I really really do not want to do it. 
I would appreciate any advice, thoughts, etc. I’m truly at a loss as to how to proceed other than to keep putting him off and hoping he forgets about it.","I'm living this as well. It's been over 2 years since I've been intimate with my husband. We're in our 40's. He's not the same person, and when you have to help them dress, prepare all their meals, manage doctor appointments, medication, personal hygiene, etc, the desire for sex disappears. Like you, it feels like taking care of a child, and that's just not a turn-on. Add to that because you're doing all of the above plus a full-time job; there is just no energy for it. Don't feel guilty; we're all just doing our best.
I’m in this same situation with my wife. It’s been 2 years. Aside from not feeling even remotely attracted to her sexually any more, the thought of “pity sex” feels like “vulnerable adult” territory, if you know what I mean. There have been a few times when she has been doing better, and she’s more clear headed (a long ways from the old normal), but an hour later or the next morning she’s back out in left field and I’m glad I didn’t initiate anything. 

It’s emotionally exhausting being a caregiver. People say, “You’re so patient. You’re a saint.” I don’t want to be a saint!
I’m so sorry. This is an issue No one talks about, but I’m certain is NOT uncommon! Thank you for sharing this. Your feelings are valid. You don’t owe him intimacy (just like he doesn’t “owe” you to be cognitively 100% and you accept that without question. It just is. ) I can’t imagine your inner anguish. Losing your best friend and lover day by day. I see you. I’d hug you if I could (and it was ok with you) ❤️
Thank you for posting this. From all the posts here about parents with dementia, I was beginning to think I was the only one with a spouse who has dementia. I haven't had sex with my wife (or anyone) in over 15 years. I don't even have any romantic feelings for her anymore. I can't help it. Our relationship changed from an adult-adult to an adult-child relationship.
I'm with you, my 62 y.o. wife has early onset FTD. We were last intimate in July 2020. She's deteriorated a lot since then. Her hygiene is not good, I'm constantly reminding her to clean herself. That and the constant care really puts a damper on any sexual desire. Fortunately she hasn't brought it up at all. 

We finally placed her in a memory care facility at the beginning of February 2022. I think if you just deflect and distract your husband, he probably won't remember it. That seems to work with my wife when she asks to come home. 

I would also advocate you join a support group either locally or online. [Alzheimers.org](https://Alzheimers.org) has resources to get started. Hilarity for Charity was founded by Seth Rogen and his sister after their mom had Alzheimers. They offer online support groups. [wearehfc.org](https://wearehfc.org) 

Like one of the other posters, I'm not sure I can stay celibate the rest of my life. Of course that brings in it's own load of guilt and what to do or not do...
I wish I had some wisdom for you. I don't. I am in the same situation. Like your husband,  my wife isn't the same person and what you describe that you're going through is the same for me. I can usually ""tuck her into bed"" with a kiss and then say I have to go do chores (I usually leave the dirty dishes for this time).  Hang in there, you're not alone, internet stranger.
I don't have any advice for you but I just wanted to thank you for posting this. It's not something I've ever really considered as an aspect of dementia because the person I'm caring for is my mom, but this strikes me as so important and difficult, so thank you for having the courage to talk about it.
My wife 59 is entering the final stages of FTD. She initiated sex maybe five times in our long happy marriage (Catholic guilt). In the early stages around 2016/17 she started begging for it. Our lack of sex became part of her rambling conspiracy theories. We had pity sex twice, six months apart, around that time. Even though she was still fairly high functioning I just couldn’t do it anymore. I used excuses to get her off the topic. A few months later she stopped asking.

Now I am desperate for some intimacy, but I’m definitely not getting it from someone who sneaks off to pull down their diaper to urinate and defecate on the floor.

Edit: 27 minutes after posting this a scammer texted me.
This happened to one of our clients. He started to show boundary crossing behaviour with the nurses, and after an honest but difficult conversation with his wife, she agreed to have a (legal) trained sexworker take care of his needs. 

There are several ways to go about this, in this case the wife did not want to be involved with any more of the details, which is very understandable. There's funding for this in my country, and since its legal there are only a few hurdles to take. 

You do not have to cross your boundaries to meet his wishes. I'm sorry you are in this situation, it's incredibly hard.
You are definitely not alone. My husband, now almost 53, was diagnosed at age 47 with early onset Alzheimer’s. We didn’t have a great sex life anyways. But it’s been 3 years seen we’ve been intimate. I have no desire to be intimate with someone whose face is often covered in food and who repeats the same things over and over again.

Thankfully he has never made any attempt. I wish I could advise you on how but I guess you will just have to keep saying no. 

Sorry you’re going through it this.

A side note is that I have a lover who helps me out in that area. Sanctioned by my husband in a lucid moment years ago. But that is another story…
As awful as this may sound I am grateful my husband has heart disease along with his dementia so he is impotent.  He has never asked for any kind of drug to help him so I do not have to have the extra stress of him wanting to have sex.  It has been many years now and I hate knowing I will likely never have sex again (I am 71). Just do your best in putting him off, I can't imagine the trauma I would feel if my husband was wanting to have sex with me. Do you go to bed at the same time?  If so, can you delay getting into bed until he is asleep?
I work in a home for seniors, most all have dementia. If you find you want a divorce and require a place for your husband then those are the unfortunate cards you were dealt. I've seen ex husbands and wives continue to visit and bring items for their former spouse. You know they still love that person, but it's no quality life for you to be stuck in a situation that envelopes your entire life in such a way. It's awful, it sucks, it's incredibly sad, but it's your life and he isn't the person you married.
I’m right there with you.
I understand
No real advice, but I see this with my own parents as well. My dad doesn't understand that he and my mom are no longer together, and tries to be affectionate any time he sees her.
I can completely understand and empathize with your feelings. That is a tough space to be in.
could you just say you have your period?
That's understandable. I don't want to have sex with your husband either.

All joking aside, I feel for you. I wish there was something more I could say, some sage advice, but all I have is this stupid joke and sympathy.
I believe no person owes anyone sex. Please be kind to yourself. Love has many levels and you are loving him but do not have a sexual relationship with a person who is essentially child like in many ways.
Update: I want to thank everyone for their comments and suggestions. I think it really helped just to hear I’m not horrible for feeling this way. 

My solution this far is to blame menopause. I’m close enough to that age so I’ve said that it’s the hormones messing with me and killing desire..that I’m sure one things level off we will be back on track. That’s is all me and I’m going to the doctor to talk about hormone replacement. It’s worked pretty well. Thank goodness. 

I feel like a total dirt bag for lying to him like this but as those of us who deal with this disease find out…the kind lie is a necessity in caring for dementia.",2022-02-27 18:42:34,London2129,t31695
Dementia,Afraid to Visit my Father in Hospital...,"Some time ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/srbdmb/im_new_but_joined_some_time_ago_im_not_normally/) here about my father's accelerating downward spiral, but because of so much going on... I haven't been able to reply to any of the kind posts people wrote.

To update... My father was discharged from hospital with full live-in home care support last Wednesday morning. At first, things seemed to be OK, but then, on Thursday night I got a call from the Community Care people... My father's care worker, in a frightened panic, had called them because my father was raging that he'd stolen cheques... I was asked to call my father in an attempt to talk him down. Knowing how well my last effort went when he was extremely agitated, while still in hospital, I didn't have high hopes... As I expected, I was unable to calm my father down, and then he started accusing me of theft before slamming down the phone. I called back the Community Care people, and described my lack of success... Long story short, the hospital paramedics and police were called in.  Since then, my father has been in hospital, and his Community Care nurse is stridently urging that he be kept in hospital until a nursing home bed becomes available; I hope the hospital accepts her recommendation. For one, there's no way they are going to send live-in care givers after that, and two, my father is entirely incapable of being alone. Moreover, there's NO WAY I'm able to have him live with me; that leaves the hospital. What makes me angry and frustrated is that EVERYONE, including my father's hospital care team, thought something like this could happen, to the point of outlining, to me, the measures that would be taken if it did. He should NEVER have been discharged in the first place!

Yesterday, my father's hospital nurse called, because my father was ""confused,"" and wanted to speak to me about ""his missing things."" Namely, his wallet, cheques, money etc. I pressed the nurse for details (because I've seen this movie twice now), and he conceded that my father was indeed agitated again.. I replied that if I spoke with my father, it would only make matters worse, and requested they not call to ask if I can talk him down when he's agitated.

The thing is... I want to visit my father... but I'm very apprehensive. Yes, I can call in advance to find out what kind of a frame my father is in, and yes, I can ask again at the front desk of his floor before going in, but... as everyone knows... dementia patients, especially those prone to aggression, are very unpredictable... On one hand, I want to see my father, but on the other, I'm afraid of risking the chance that I'll set him off... I just don't know how to handle this, and I don't know how to respond to his accusations. I'm very aware that when somebody with dementia is having delusions you should go along with them.... This, though... how the Hell do I respond to that?","Have you spoken to your father's attending physician at all? What are their ideas for helping your father not feel so scared/anxious/agitated? It sounds like it may be time for some anti-anxiety medications, so that your father can be safely cared for by others, and also so he won't feel so frightened of what's happening around him. He is most certainly experiencing this because of his cognitive impairment--he is scared because things are changing around him and he has no knowledge or recollection of those changes.

Whether or not you want to visit is entirely up to you. If you go to visit earlier in the day, you may catch him when he's much calmer and not so agitated. Typically with dementia patients, agitation starts to happen later in the day (called ""sundowning"".) Or wait until your father's anxiety is being managed by medications first.
This is entirely my personal experience with my grandmother - she stayed at home with me, my parents, and a nurse. Every few weeks she would complain about the nurse stealing a black coloured wallet of hers, which in reality, she never had. To keep her calm, we would help her and pretend to look for it, talk to the nurse (she was aware that the wallet doesn't exist and didn't mind playing along) in front of her and slowly we would start to distract her. Eventually (sometimes in a few minutes, sometimes in a few hours) she would forget about the wallet. It is something you can try if your father did not actually have any cheques and is confused.
Its awful, I'm sorry.  My Dads in a home (sent there by the hospital) and has sundowners pretty bad some days.  I can still calm him down.  But I've learned over time.  If he's genuinely scared I'll stay on the phone.  But when it switches to anger I'm done because I'll get nowhere, he just gets angrier.  I get exactly what you're saying here.  

You might take the time to tell or write your perspective of your father for the staff if you think it will help them look after him better.  But don't let them guilt you because you KNOW your father.  And they are being paid to look after him.  It can take some time for them to sort out the right medications to calm him and also to find the best times to give them.",2022-02-27 16:01:40,WickedWenchOfTheWest,t2xqs5
Dementia,I’m pissed.,My grandma is the one with dementia but last night my grandpa got mad over a potato and   starting say fuck them kids they don’t know what the F… they are doing. He got ecola like 4 years ago and isn’t right in the head. I hate him all he cares about is himself. He bought a brand new computer and my grandma has been asking for a new bed for 5 years. How selfish of him.I hope karma catches up to him so bad. 😔😔,"A friend’s grandparents both developed dementia, and oddly it progressed at the same pace for both of them. Once they were finally moved to a care home and the family was able to start de-hoarding the house, they discovered a huge mold infestation. Their doctor felt this could definitely have contributed, and explained why they both became symptomatic at the same time, deteriorated at the same time.

I’m not saying it’s mold, but that you should explore every possibility. Maybe the e-coli infection left lasting damage, who knows? Get him to the doctor. Try speaking with his doctor privately ahead of time, if possible.",2022-02-27 14:16:19,Global_Extent_3407,t2vhm0
Dementia,"Delusions, paranoia, carrying around 100 bags. Help.",My moms on all the meds. She’s mid-later stage. Living w my sister. Convinced ghosts are stealing her things. Bawls over it daily.

StRtinf to be too scared to go outside. Go anywhere. Cuz “they’ll” steal her stuff. Help.,"If there's a sharp uptake in behaviors, you might want to get her checked for a UTI. When Mom rapidly escalated it was always a UTI. She'd settle back down after getting it treated.
There are a ton of meds for dementia. In my experience, none of them really work other than in a very fleeting capacity to delay the inevitable progression, which really sucks.  

A combination of trial and error with mood stabilizers/anti-depressants and specific techniques to redirect and de-escalate is probably going to be your best bet.

Memory loss is only one manifestation of dementia, which generally equates to different parts of of the brain progressively dying for various reasons.  Depending on the type and severity of the specific dementia all kinds of things, besides or in addition to memory loss, are impacted.  I’ve seen people lose the ability to talk, to feel emotions and lose very particular motor functions.  The physiological manifestations of dementia are almost endless.  Basically, if you’ve seen one type of dementia, you’ve seen one type of dementia; and dementia is an umbrella term that is used to describe over 120 different afflictions.

You can’t treat the cause, or even effectively slow the progression, except for maybe alcohol induced dementia, but you can try to alleviate the symptoms.  Dementia care is all about trying to preserve quality of life through whatever means might work with the the particular person and particular manifestation of dementia.

It really is a horrible disease and I’m so sorry your having to deal with it.
What “meds” is she on? I had the constant battle of my mom packing up her stuff to leave.. I ditched the suitcases in the house.
My dad was doing stuff like that and I have them discontinued the Seroquel. They substituted Buspar instead and he was still having delusions and anxiety Etc so I told them to stop that as well. It's only been a few days but he seems much more calm and less worried definitely less delusional. I know that doctors like to prescribe those types of medicines in an attempt to control those types of behavior but in my little bit of experience, it seems to make them worse. When you ask the doctor to help they just want to increase the dose which makes things worse and worse. If you look at the common side effects and contraindications of those types of Medicine, they are not indicated for people with dementia and the side effects are often anxiety, panic disorders, hallucinations, dizziness, confusion, Etc. Ask your doctor if you can try just decreasing the dosages to see if it makes any difference at all? I feel like what we did is working for my dad, I hope you can find something that works for your mother.
Is it possible one or more of her medications are causing hallucinations? My dad was on one that certainly helped his memory but he ""saw people "" that weren't there.
Tell doc to increase dosage on the anti-anxiety med. The right music can calm anxiety. A routine, structured day with little variation can be calming to one suffering from dementia.

Dementia,“Cold symptoms” for last year,My grandmother who has had dementia for the last two years and is rapidly getting worse has been saying she has a cold everyday for the last year. She is constantly wiping her nose that is not runny and just feels run down. We’ve decided it is just one of her things that she focuses on whether it’s real or not. Is “being sick” a common thing dementia patients dwell on?,"Could she have dust or plant pollen allergies?  If she does a supplement called quercetin which comes in capsules has helped me a lot!!

Dementia,What would change if you knew it was the last time they recognised you?,"Laying against him. A bonus day. I don't know how many remain, so I cling to what I can.

Dawn brings light, and renewed hope. This could be the day he recovers. The day he remembers himself.  And me. Us.

The last time we were together seems so long ago.  Unknowing how scarce the future would become,  that last day of us passed by as if it was normal.  So precious,  yet unremarked. Its loss not mourned until it was too late. Lover, I cry now, I thought you were coming back.

Those days since, well we've been moving around each other so carefully.   Like in those shops; you look. But don't touch.  The distance between each touch grows longer,  even as we talk and live and enter our deadly routine for the day.  We see each other clearly.  There are no walls or distance the eye can understand. But we are locked away. My heart reaches, but the brain says no, hold on.

Every day at dawn I think this could be it.  Last night's touch could've been the start of our renewal.   I missed the day it ended,  but I'll forever mark the day it returned.   The eagerness grows, yet that bright spark,  not nurtured,  fades. But it's early.  There's still so much time. Hold on.

Routine routine.  If it's done then look for more.   Maybe we got through yesterday, last week, last month,  because the routine kept us bound.  Today's routine may find the key.  And unlock his heart again.  Busy. Work.  Hurry up. What next. 

He's back. Be careful spark,  not too bright.  It might be the hope pushing him away.  Shhh. How was it, I hear you asking me... sad lover, can you see?  Did the day bring your prize?  Did you glimpse his true heart again? 

Maybe. Just...maybe.  But I did get one thing.  It's enough for right now.   One more night.   I lay beside him. Hold on.","'Be careful spark. Not too bright'. Really hit me. Absolutely beautiful x
Routine routine. If it's done look for more. Is very relatable in a never ending,never enough way for this sickness. All of what you written is painfully beautiful. Sorry you and your loved one is going through this 😢
Night before last, he rolled over and threw his heavy arm around me. I hate that, and always have. But I left his arm there anyway. I couldn’t bear to move out from under it.
Powerful, true, heartbreaking.  I'm with you, I fear the day he doesn't see me anymore.
The forgetting who I am for brief moments, is starting to happen more frequently.
Thank you for sharing this. You have managed to capture the most torturous, horrible moment so eloquently, making it beautiful.
Beautiful—hang in there OP!  This is the most painful process.

Dementia,Why I like bin day,"First time poster here, and I thought my first post would be a teary, exhausted plea for help. That's how I feel most of the time caring for Mum. I've never really liked her, and she wasn't the best parent.

On to why I like bin day. Today is the day I go to Mum's house and put out the bins. For my tidy soul I do like to fill it up with junk. Each week I insist we throw two things away. Today was a win! We threw out a broken toilet seat and a bucket of very old tennis balls AND I was allowed to take the plastic Christmas tree away (as long as I donate it).

Now we can stand in the doorway of the shed and for some reason I just feel like today was a good day.","It's always good to read of a positive - any positive - and thank you for sharing. Good on you for still being there for your mom.
Good for you!!  When going through a rough time having something productive to do makes the day go faster, and makes you feel like you accomplished SOMETHING.  Little victories.
> ""a broken toilet seat and a bucket of very old tennis balls""

But you never know when you're going to need them! What if an aging tennis player visits and wants to relive their glory days, then out of frustration nicks your toilet seat, eh?
Ha ha! Go you! Take the bin day win!
I have the opposite problem. My mom wants to throw everything she doesn't own away and replace it with shiny new plastic crap.
Everytime is visit my mom, I take out her trash and usually grab a few things along the way. Currently her home is filled with old paperbacks and magazines and she will NOT let me give them away or donate them to the library at her assisted living facility.

Dementia,Could I have mild cognitive impairment?,"I'm 23 years old, obese, have high cholesterol, and have anxiety/depression. In September, I accidentally ate a THC edible. This led to the deterioration of my mental health.

I don't recreationally do any substances and don't drink. My paternal grandmother passed away from dementia and if I'm not mistaken, so did my paternal grandfather. Do I have MCI and could this go away or is this permanent? Thank you for your help.","It sounds like you might want to try talking to a doctor. Sometimes depression can cause a lot of the symptoms you mentioned.
Honestly this sounds like anxiety and depression. You should be evaluated and treated for these.
The good news is that it's almost 100% certain that your cognitive impairments are completely reversible.  The bad news is that you'll have to take responsibility for your health and work to repair it.  Listen to what the professionals have told you and make a healthy lifestyle your top priority.  Eat healthy food, exercise, and get 8 hours of sleep a night. Also, follow the course of treatment given to you by your physician and psychologist. Do this for six months.  It's almost a certainty that you'll feel better.  When that happens, take a moment to feel grateful.
I have the same thing, too. You are too young to develop dementia.  If you did, it would be considered so rare you’d be a case report in a medical journal. Mine is due to depression and anxiety and not taking care of myself the way I should. I’m a size six and don’t have cholesterol issues so what we have in common is depression/anxiety and that will definitely cause the mental fog
Were you close to your grandparents? You may be suffering from grief and identifying with the pain and tribulations they went through (dementia). Depression of some kind is likely in any case.
Dude eating an edible months ago doesn’t deteriorate your mental health. Sounds like you a grappling with school and the weight it puts on, coupled with anxiety over dementia  on your paternal side. Really you are dealing likely with depression and anxiety. You should seek attention of a medical professional.

If you want to relive some anxiety, go take a dna test from 23 and me and do the medical review, which includes the enzyme for late onset Alzheimer’s.  It’s $200 but man did I relive some stress knowing I didn’t have the markers since both my mom and abuela had it.
Oh my, I can totally understand your worry! Please see your doctor and don’t let them brush you off. There are lots of things that can cause cognitive impairment, and a lot of them are treatable!
You can have MCI at that age for a host of reasons. But also brains can heal given the right conditions. ❤",2022-02-26 21:25:42,foreignleandrip,t2dmze

We have a keyed deadbolt (both inside and outside) on our front door- we keep the keys hooked over a wall protector attached to the closet by the front door (high enough up that my MIL doesn’t have access to it but we can unlock the door when needed). We found out the hard way that you can’t keep the keys in the deadbolt when MIL is staying at our home- she may have severe dementia but I’ll be darned if she didn’t unlock the deadbolt and make a (very short) run for it! #dementia adventures
Search ""Confounding Door Locks"", they have one which doesn't require a key, just a certain way to open.  I would never use a lock which you would need a key to open from the inside, doesn't seem safe in an emergency.

Dementia,My dad is no longer suffering,"It’s been a month to the day since he passed. I couldn’t bring myself to talk about it before but it just dawned on me that it’s been a month. A complete blur of a month.


He had Lewy body and it was awful. He fought hard until the very end. He was always so strong and seemed invincible even during his delusions. But he’s not suffering anymore. Although I am angry that dementia robbed us of his final 2 years. He was here but he really wasn’t. 


I appreciate this sub so much. I learned a lot from the posts and it was comforting talking to people who understood how it felt.


Wishing everyone here the strength to care for their loved ones battling this awful disease. May you find comfort and cherish the lucid moments.","I'm very sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is very tough and sad. Losing one over and over is probably the hardest thing I had to endure. 

Take care of yourself and I hope you allow yourself to grieve.
I can’t imagine what you’ve been going through, and I’m so sorry that you lost your dear dad. I know it’s just words on a screen, but I’m sending you so much love. Thank you for taking the time to share comfort and support with all of us. May you also find comfort and peace. 💗💗💗
I am so sorry you lost your dad.  You have every right to feel angry- dementia robbed him, and you, of so much.  Be proud of the man he was, who did his best despite an awful diagnosis.  

Nobody can replace your dad- it’s a hard loss and I am truly sorry.
I’m sorry. It gets easier, but it takes a long time. My mother passed in August from Vascular dementia.  I felt full on exhaustion both mentally and physically. I was shocked that I felt so much grief after her death. I had grieved every loss along the way and I was glad she was no longer suffering. I also felt lost. I was so focused on her care for two years. I say all this just to say I understand and to reassure you that bit by bit it will get easier.
Lewy Body is so hard. I’m glad my dad never forgot who we were but the hallucinations were nearly non-stop the last few months.
I’m very sorry for your loss. Dementia is such a cruel illness. I hope you and your family find comfort in the fact that your father’s struggle has ended and that he is in a better place. Sending lots of love.
I’m so sorry he - and you - had to go through this. Gentle hugs to you.
Take your time to glue all the pieces back! 💪
My sincere condolences to you. 

Dementia sucks

My dad passed from dementia in June. We took care of him 24/7 for 2 1/2 years at home. He deserved every minute of our care. I miss him something fierce, but he left us quite awhile ago
I'm so sorry for your loss x
Losing my dad is the worst thing I've ever experienced.
I lost my Mom on Monday and feeling relief that she doesn’t have to suffer any longer. Watching her die was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.",2022-02-26 09:46:22,anitabelle,t1yot1
Dementia,"Both Parents Dementia, Violence, Looking For Advice...","Both of my parents at age 69 have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I'm 32 and an only child, single, no kids.  I already have POA.

They live in the country, with few family members around. I work full time remotely and can work from their place, but it's getting more difficult and stressful.  

I have to remind them to take medications, fill out their weekly pill boxes, clean, and go with them to appointments. If I don't help them with food they will just eat cereal and ice cream. There are few resources around and their neurologist is 1.5 hours away, which can take almost my whole working day when I take them. 

Dad has gotten more aggressive and they have both hurt each other several times. Mostly grabbing or pushing, I haven't seen actual punching. A few nights ago dad pushed mom and she fell on her face, busting her lip and getting a bloody nose. He was immediately apologetic and said it won't happen again but I know it's probably just a matter of time. I told them if it happens again I will have them separated. It's all starting to affect my mental well being. Both of their families blame me when I'm not there watching them 24 hours a day, but of course none of them have offered to take one of them in. 

They are still very independent in some ways so I think it's too early to consider placing them somewhere. They both still drive, mom likes to go shopping, dad likes to meet friends at the diner. That said, mom's short term memory is almost completely gone. She rarely can remember what happened the day before.  

I've hired someone to help clean. When I'm not here my cousin helps with their medications, but I can't expect her to do everything. I tried asking the county DSS, they said they would have to be put on a waiting list to get any type of home aid. I called to larger cities but most wouldn't service this area. 

In addition to working full time I'm also taking my architecture registration exams, so you can imagine how difficult it is to try and keep an eye on them, work, study, and do everything for them. I'm afraid that we couldn't afford a live-in caretaker but that's the only solution that I feel would work. Is there anything I'm missing here in terms of options? 

Thank you.","Not to be nosy, and this may be a dumb question. but has their neurologist recommended that they may be suitable for Palliative Care? I’m currently in a struggle to decide whether we need to get guardianship of my grandfather. And we asked that he be seen by Palliative Care to get an outside opinion about how bad off he is and what our options for care are? They do an assessment and give you a numerical score as to what level of care that they require.
This isn't sustainable for you, and it's not going to get easier. Caring for one person is too much work for one person. It's impossible to care for two. 

How much do you know about the disease process and what to expect next?
IDK if it’s something available in your area, but hopefully it helps. I’m in a similar boat right now, and it’s so hard to find info on what to do to help them. Wishing you the best!
My mom is similar but lives alone. We hired a sitter to come in several hours a day and got hospice on board to see her a couple of times a week. The sitter adds up but hospice is free. It's not nearly enough but more than she wants and every little bit helps take some weight off of you.
I'm going to be blunt: I think you need to look for an assisted living with a memory care unit. Caring for one person with dementia eventually becomes a 24/7 job which you cannot, CANNOT do without round-the-clock help. Caring for two won't be possible. This goes doubly if they're violent. That kind of behavior isn't manageable. All it takes is one outburst and someone is in the hospital. Or dead. And if it's you, who takes care of them then?

Work will also become impossible. Their behavior can easily be relentlessly disruptive. My dad would wander the house ranting, raving, screaming, taking things apart, etc. I once came out from a Zoom work meeting to find him trying to cut his hand off with kitchen shears. He believed it was rotting and he had to take it off. It took the rest of the afternoon to calm him down and get the shears away from him. Afterwards, I was so exhausted that I couldn't get any more work done, and in any case, it was time to do dinner, get him to eat, get him to take his meds (another 1-2 hour ordeal), get him into bed, etc. And that's another factor - between the confusion, paranoia, fear, and anger, any type of dementia caregiving takes a looooooooooooooooong time and a lot of patience. We could barely handle my dad between me, my mom, and a full time caregiver. 

You can't handle two of them. You can't. It has nothing to do with you or your love or willingness. It's just literally not possible for a human being to do. Best to put plans in place now than to have to get them into a facility in a hurry because the wheels have fallen off the wagon.
What medication are they on? Memantine may prove beneficial. Do your parents have respite from one another, ie activities and occupation apart out with the home? Might be helpful to clarify what country you’re in so people can give more specific responses.
Oh gosh so sorry, that sound hard for you all, I feel for you!.   Have you contacted your appropriate area dementia .org &/ alzheimers .org?   Here down in Aust they have tons of expert experienced resources, counselling, telephone help-lines, mini-workshops, literature, etc etc etc.  They'd be the ones capable of advising you options to investigate.   Best of luck!
So Sorry you're going through this..

That they both still drive seems super scarey to me...
Why don’t you put them in assisted living with a memory care unit that they can transition into?
it’s time for them to be placed in care homes. One patient is hard enough. And they are injuring each other. each injury advances the dementia, as the body has to divert resources from the brainpower it does have. you’ve got not just one but two powder kegs.

The only part I can really speak to is regarding the criticism from other family members. F ‘em! They get to have an opinion when they contribute to the care. Otherwise, they need to shut up.

We we’re able to keep my mom at home for the last few weeks of her life. I did everything I was physically, emotionally, and financially capable of doing. Yet, I received a constant barrage of criticism from several of her friends. My husband reminded me that until those people spent the night with her, or helped her on and off the toilet, or paid the $7K/week… they don’t get a say in her care.",2022-02-25 15:52:15,bucheonsi,t1e7kq
Dementia,Not sure what to do…,Moved grandma to a long term facility a couple weeks ago. It became increasingly difficult to care for her during the night time and she had foot injury. Family has been checking in on her constantly at the facility. Every time we visit red flags come up. Today we overheard a work say she’ll beat a resident if she doesn’t take her pills. They haven’t been checking her blood sugar and often times she’s been pushed aside to the corner to sit all alone. There always seems to be a lack of workers among other things. I want to take her out of that facility but I don’t know what to do. She was getting better care at home from family even though we were burnt out. It seems so cruel to ship her off to some care home to be abused by strangers until she dies. I just want to care for her and make her comfortable but I’m out of options any thoughts or positive vibes would be much appreciated thank you.,"This is where we are as a society. We either ruin any quality of life we currently have, quit jobs, neglect families and commitments to care for a loved one. Or experience the stress of leaving them in the care of others at a facility that is running with such minimal and underpaid staffing that they can't possibly be expected to be attentive. When I first found out the was one single doctor that oversaw the entire rehab facility while they were full time employed at their own practice, I was amazed that it was allowed never mind common practice. They came once a week at night and it was a joke. So I have decided to give up my life to care for my elder because at least I am not worried about how they are being cared for.
It might just be a crummy facility, but make sure that everything you need done (such as checking blood sugar) is written in her care plan. You should be having a meeting soon to go over that care plan. If it's a nursing facility, you can look at the federal Medicare inspections online and see what infractions or complaints they may have, and also their staffing ratios compared to other facilities (though these can sometimes be fudged). If it's non-medical assisted living or memory care, those inspections are done by the state and should also be available for you to review. I don't believe a facility can provide the same level of care as loving and devoted caregivers at home, but you should be able to do better than this and not feel that you've abandoned her in a neglectful place.",2022-02-25 15:44:14,nuppypuppy,t1e186
Dementia,Abif and high blood pressure,Anyone here have experience with adding heart medications to an already fragile mind?

Dementia,Can talking to yourself out loud be a symptom of dementia?,"I know many of us talk aloud to ourselves in our daily lives w/o suffering from cognitive decline. But I live with my mother, who suffers from some form of dementia (working on getting a diagnosis) and she talks to herself constantly (when she’s not parked in front of the tv). Usually she’s just narrating to herself what she’s doing, ie if she’s boiling eggs she’ll say “now it looks like they’re done. Time to run them under cold water” etcetera. I have to have a white noise machine running sometimes so I’m not distracted by it. I just wanted to see if other people w dementia sometimes exhibit this behavior?","I’m not sure if what you described is a dementia related behaviour. Too much input needs output = talking to oneself. She could also be worried about something and trying to distract herself with verbal chatter- ask her if something is bothering her. She is lonely.
My grandma does this as well. In her case though, I know she’s hallucinating and talking to people I don’t see. 

Many times she talks in a whisper. 

She will also cut me off and tell me to be quiet so she can hear these people I cannot see. 

When I ask her what they’re saying, she’ll tell me and then say I need to get my ears checked.
Yes, it's a coping mechanism for your LO. I've found it was very comforting for Mum as it kept her focused and present. Until she couldn't. But she would still mutter and chat asleep or not. Whatever it was/is, it was always hilarious and ended her up in fits of giggles. 

I talk to myself and always did as a child. 'just getting out my pencil case'.. Hmm, I choose this colour ',' 
I'd quietly and audibly narrate my day. It was a coping mechanism and still is.
You will come across many things that will urk you during this time.
Never beat yourself up, you're learning how to cope too.
I know this is an old post but maybe it’s her way of still doing stuff herself rather than a symptom. Like she talks herself through cooking so she remembers what to do next.",2022-02-25 12:12:35,SuchMatter1884,t192tx
Dementia,Invasion of the Brain Snatchers,"If Dementia/Alzheimer’s were a horror movie, that would be the title. 

Bit by bit this disease robs our loved ones’ brains and leaves a body that appears to be them but isn’t.","Agreed. It if funny too that when someone still looks ok, people think they are fine. My siblings see a clean, fresh clothes person in their regular chair doing reading the paper but they don't spend enough time to notice the papers pages never turn. They are not there for the confusions and anger and that is hard too.
I feel this. The shell looks the same, but the being inside is an alien trying unsuccessfully to mimic a human.
I agree! It's hard watching someone you know decline, like they're becoming someone else or just an empty shell as another commenter put it.

There actually is a horror movie about an elderly woman with Alzheimers called 'The Taking of Deborah Logan,' but it's about spirit/demonic possession.
I know that feeling so well....

These days, I'm grappling with the reality that there's increasingly little of my father left in there... he has declined so very rapidly over the past month...Yet, he's still aware enough to know he has essentially lost it, and he has threatened self-harm. A part of me feels that I've lost him already... and that it would be a blessing to him.. if it ended sooner, rather than later...

Thankfully my mom died just before COVID got a foothold here, but any infection or injury will make dementia worse. Sometimes they recover a bit but other times it's just lost.
I’ve heard similar declines happen after surgery/anesthesia.  Inflammation and they get worse.
Yes same here … I’ve read about hospital delirium and makes sense to me that it’s what my gma had happen to her
my grandma had a grand mal seizure and is no longer able to walk after covid. truly
horrific.
My family members without dementia had cognitive issues after recovering from Covid so I can only imagine how much worse it would be for someone with dementia.
My dad was in the hospital just before COVID lockdowns. We took turns staying with him 24/7 for 5 days, he had unspecified fever and infection.
It was awful even with us there. He was given low dose iv Ativan. The nurses were kind but we understood it was a safety issue for them, him and us.",2022-02-24 23:52:57,babyj48,t0vbdq

Dementia sucks
Our dad died June 5th
It’s a horrible disease
Sorry you’re going through it 💞
My mom went downhill pretty quickly after a steady decline and died last fall. I was her POA/caregiver (even though she was in assisted living, I handled a lot and visited a lot) and after she died there was relief of course and a huge void. As her executor, settling everything has kept me busy and her body’s death off my mind.  What I realized is that I mourned years ago, for several years, watching my mom disappear.  My mom was gone before her body passed.  Remember your uncle as he was before this evil disease took over.
Sleep, exercise and taking time for yourself
I'm sorry

&#x200B;

Remember that when it is all over, you don't have to figure out What's Next right away. Give yourself some time to rest and recover. You've been through the wringer the past few years.
It is so horrible.  My FIL is taking care of my MIL who has Alzheimer's, and he said that she was asking him to take her home to her mother's house.  Her mother died over 30 years ago.  My FIL is struggling and is refusing any help because he thinks anyone who will come in will steal everything in the house.  <insert eye roll here>

EDIT TO ADD:  Take some time for yourself.  There is no need to rush to figure out what's next.

Dementia,Is it better to lie?,"My Grandmother (who didn’t have dementia) just passed away. My grandfather has dementia and it has gotten worse since she passed. He asks where she is about every 2 hours. My mom has been telling him she died and he has to relive that heartbreak over and over. 

My mom insists this is best for him but I disagree, I think she should lie and tell him she’s at the store and redirect the conversation. She’s very upset I even suggested this, so what’s everyone’s opinion? Do you lie or continue to tell the truth?

Edit to add: apparently a grief counselor told her to never lie to him 😑","No it's not best to torture him with reliving that pain over and over. I've never wore understood how people can believe that.

With my mom, when she asked where my dad was, I'd just tell her, ""Right where you left him"" which was 100% true but not where she thought she left him. It satisfied her because to her it meant Dad was home watching TV and didn't feel like traveling to see her. 

Saying something like, ""She's not at home right now"" hopefully will satisfy him without ""lying""... Although compassionate lies are considered by most to be acceptable, to keep dementia patients from reliving painful events or going through something upsetting for no good reason.
Lie. It’s the compassionate thing to do.

(I lie to my wife who has dementia every day for the reason you mention.)

It kills me but it provides her some relief.
It's called therapeutic lying and as mentioned by others here, is the compassionate approach. People living with dementia have memory loss. And as such can not retain new information. Think of it as lying to the dementia not your grandfather. When he asks about his wife you can reply by saying...are you looking for her because you want to tell her something or you want to be near her? Provide a choice and then redirect based on his answer. Reminisce and talk about happy thoughts. 
Therapeutic lying has some limitations...do not embellish or make promises. So you could say ""grandma isn't here right now. Was there something you wanted to tell her or you just wanted to be near?"" Do not go on a say something like...she'll visit tomorrow, etc. Because that is not kind. Hope this helps.
My dad was diagnosed 22 years ago, I made the mistake of trying to make him “realize” that he was mistaken about everything. So I had the bright idea to take him to my grandparents grave to prove to him that they were gone. I learned a very hard lesson that day and also inadvertently tore my dads heart out. 

When he realized that they were gone and when he realized he was losing his mind. He was totally defeated and I felt so terrible, it wasn’t my intention. It was like it was his first time realizing they were gone and realizing his diagnosis again

So in short

Yes! LIE!
I think of it as they're living in a parallel world inside their own head, their reality is not the same as our reality.  By working within that realm I'm not lying, I'm joining their reality.

And really, what's the point of trying to force what I 'know' is true in my world, when that world no longer exists for them? It's needless pain and sorrow that can easily be avoided by a small adjustment on my part. 

But it is something that some in my family really struggle with and they have a hard time seeing that as what's best, especially if you've been raised to believe strongly in honesty as a virtue. Trying to get them to understand they need to learn a new set of rules specific to living with dementia is challenging.
In dementia care we are trained to lie about things like this. The reason being that those with dementia only have their emotions with them and current thoughts. You put their emotions first, and it is not fair to put them through this tormenting cycle of reliving that news. I highly recommend looking up reputable sources on training for caregiving with those with dementia and presenting these findings to your mom.
Absolutely lie if that spares the trauma to both sides.  There's no use in pushing the truth when it brings repeated pain.  I avoid talking much about mom for the same reason - after 65 years with mom, he usually breaks down if I talk about her.  To spare the pain, it's easier to let him bring her up when and if he does.
I work at a nursing home, and “lying” is honestly my go to when it comes to this sort of stuff. It’s the most humane thing to do
I worked in a memory care ward and the only thing that ever came from the residents being told the truth was them being devastated for the rest of the day. No reason to hurt them with knowledge they're just going to forget in the morning. Lie to him so he doesn't spend every day learning over and over again that he just lost the love of his life.
My mum was at the stage where we needed to tell her. My dad was such an integral part of her day-to-day and she needed answers. Eventually, after a year she's accepted that he's gone, but I've reinforced the positive aspects of their relationship and focused on gratitude for him. She still waits for him every day until she remembers he's gone, but reminiscing helps her cope. It's very individual to be honest. The stage she's at allows her to retain some recent knowledge of events. So she has some peace, but we're a year in. Grief amplifies the dementia response and she's had a hard time processing it. 

If lying is maintaining the peace he feels and he can't process the reality, it's a kindness. 

I'm so sorry for your loss.
Why not say it differently? Is he religious? If so, she’s visiting old friends… (dead ones, but leave this out). Not religious, just say she’s not available.
This same thing happened to my grandpa. He would ask many times a day about my grandma after she died. At first everyone told him she died snd it was like starting the grieving process over for him every time. It made him do upset and was very sad. It got to the point that instead of giving him feel destroyed every day we would tell him she was fine and that’s all it took to ease his mind. In the end it was the kinder option for him. Nothing is gained by them being so upset.
I’ll just say she’s out to the supermarket and will be back soon. There’s no point because he would just ask again and again, it’s so painful for him.
I think lying is the easy call.  What is gained? I know it feels attend, but we did this with our mother, both with dad, who had passed a few years before but she started forgetting this and asking where he was, and with our brother who we lost after the point when she would have been able to process it.  It was tough to not tell Mom her eldest child had died, but it was the right thing to do.  She would not have been able to actually mourn him and would have just learned about it over and over (if, at that point, she was alert and oriented enough to remember him)
Yes
LIE! LIE!
My mother would cry about her parents all the time. An SSRI (Lexipro) helped a lot. The dose is just 25% of a typical dose because of side effects (increased confusing, poorer physical coordination), but it took the edge off of anxiety and sadness for her.
My cousin passed away just a few months ago, leaving her son to care for her 95 year old mother.  He was doing the same thing. Every time she asked where her daughter was, he told her that she’d passed.  He told me she deserved to know. I didn’t agree then, and I don’t agree now. I think it’s cruel to make them relive the loss over and over. When she asked me I told her she was at the store.
My dad often asks where ""mother"" is. I don't know if he means his mom or my mom. The answer is the same, though. She moved back to Washington. Lie, lie, lie.
Yes, the Alzheimer’s support person on the ALZ connect hotline mentioned something like “strategic lying” or “therapeutic lying”. 

My mom keeps asking about my dad and I end up retelling the whole story (who he was, how they met, how he died etc). Like you - I’m not comfortable “therapeutic lying” for this yet - so usually I just say “I don’t feel like talking about it right now”, and that works (especially if we went over it a few times already that hour / day).
My grandmother often asks where her cat is. He hides and avoids her because she pulls his tail and fur (unintentionally, she's just trying to pet him).

But we just tell her he's sleeping under the bed and not to wake him, because if she thinks he's missing it sets her off for the rest of the day.
You might be able to finnese your response like ""She isn't here right now.""  ""No, I don't know when she'll be back.""  ""Look!  A hummingbird!""
If he is having to ask every two hours or so he is not capable of retaining the new information. It does him no good. Did you ever have a separate vacation house anywhere or have separate family vacations? If do you could say she's gone to the beach/mountains/wherever with one of her relatives. Or if he's lost a sense of time and doesnt know thst nightime=time to be at home maybe say she's at work or shopping.
I agree with most others who are recommending lying.

However, I don’t think we should judge your mom for her decision. One of my core fundamental values is honesty. We didn’t even do Santa because we didn’t want that dishonesty. 

Having to deal with my spouse with Alzheimer’s and trying to reconcile that the idea of lying is okay has been/still is a HUGE issue.

Especially with teens at home who I am trying to teach the same value of truth overriding discomfort, etc.

So maybe your mom has the same belief and/or struggle. It isn’t easy and whatever she chooses, whether you agree or not, is something to support. Have you discussed it with her (as to why she wants to tell the truth)?",2022-02-24 16:22:33,Paprmoon7,t0lsli
Dementia,Help needed. Grandfather getting kicked from Florida MemoryCare facility due to violence.,"Cross posting from /r/alzheimers. Last month my mother moved her father into memorycare down in Florida. He had been living with my aunt and uncle at their house with my grandmother (his wife) in the West Palm Beach area, but it got to a breaking point of not being able to care for him. Today we were told he is being kicked out after physically assaulting a nurse for a 2nd time resulting in the nurse being sent to a hospital. My mother is scrambling to find a new facility that can care for him, as moving him back into my aunt's house is just out of the question. Does anyone have recommendations in Florida, specifically near the Palm Beach area for dementia/alzheimer patient living facilities that may get violent?","For the short term, to get his behavior under control, he does need to be in a geriatric psych facility. Several of the patients in the memory care that my mom was in were referred there more than once. They're sent to determine what meds will control their negative behaviors the best without completely drugging them.
It sounds like grandpa may need his medications adjusted. What has his attending physician suggested? A short stay in a geropsych facility to help figure out a way to help him stay calm may be the next step.
Same thing happened to my sister in Colorado who is also on Seroquel.

We found a memory care facility that had the ability to give medications 24/7.  Her first facility could only give medications twice a day and could not give any “as needed” medications. Sometimes my sister would refuse at the designated time and so she would go without her meds including the Seroquel. 

At the new facility the staff had the ability to give meds when needed and they could also administer “as needed” additional meds if she began to get combative. But that hasn’t been needed.

The new facility also has a relationship with the local geriatric psych ward at the local hospital.

I don’t know how it works in Florida, but I would bet there are memory care facilities that offer a higher level of care that can better deal with the challenges of violent residents.

Good luck to you and your family.

Dementia,Mom is now in memory care and is declining quickly. My heart is breaking.,"It’s been several months since I posted in here. 
We made the difficult decision to place Mom in a care facility on 12/16. We had been on a waiting list and had passed on two previous openings. 

Things were unraveling quickly and we knew “it was time” and I have no regrets as I know I was mentally as well as physically at my limit. My hair was literally starting to fall out from the stress of her daily care needs. 

Sadly she is not transitioning well - she does have some good days but she sundowns badly. They are still trying to find a medication cocktail that helps keep her calm but doesn’t have her “snowed” all the time. 

She was able to  walk when she left home but now is unable to and uses a wheelchair. She struggles to even stand up to go to the toilet. 

i visit as often as I can, she is always happy to see me but is sad when I leave. They say she calls out for me often. 

Her hospice nurse thinks that as rapidly as she is declining, that it wont be long.  

I know you can all relate when i say that I don't want to lose my mom but this sloe bleed is absolute hell on earth. 

All I can do now is love her as much as i possibly can and pray for peace for her and for us. 

Tremendous appreciation to everyone in this group.  it has been a God send to me.","We missed a chance to get Mom into memory care and save declined rapidly anyway. At the time my siblings and I said that if we had gotten her into a facility we would have blamed it for a decline that really was just the disease.  You clearly have been doing all you can for your mom and you breaking down would not have helped her.  I hope you and she find peace
Cruelly and at the same time morbidly encouraging, if she's rapidly declining, her sufferings (and yours) ""won't last long."" 

Did you take care of her papers/estate in healthier times? I really should do that stuff while my own parents have all their heads...
I'm sorry it has been hard for you and her.

Unfortunately declines can happen quickly even at home. One month my grandma was toileting herself pretty well with gentle reminders to go. The next she was soiling herself without realizing it. 
We are also at the point of finding a facility because we just can't keep doing it. You have done what you need for her and yourself. Now when you visit you can be present with her. 

The end closing in is always hard and dementia makes it harder. Trapped somewhere between here and gone. 
Give yourself grace during this hard time.
My heart goes out to you. Unfortunately, we have to make decisions for our loved ones based on our own needs and capabilities as well as theirs. Then we get to spend time and energy wondering if we made the right choice. Ugh, so hard, so unfair. I wish you peace.
I'm so sorry. I hope you have peace and your decision and know that you've done all that you can do.
My hope is that you can truly enjoy being with her by leaving the caretaking to the caretakers. I know easier said than done. But having that mind set has worked for me.
occupational therapist on a dementia unit here- thank you for making the decisions to allow your mom to pass with dignity & as comfortably as possible. you’re doing everything right. don’t forget to take care of you.
Hugs 🤗
❤️‍🩹
I understand how you feel. I'm sorry.
I am giving you a big internet hug right now. I went through something similar, and my heart still breaks over it all, now that she's passed (over a year ago). You're doing the right thing; I wish you lots and lots of strength during this time.
I hear you! Going through  it also with my mom, it's killing me
They leave us in small tiny moments. 
OP, time heals & memories remain.  Comfort and kindness blessings to you.
I remember feeling the same way towards the end with my mom - I hated losing her, but I hated watching her slowly waste away to this unrecognizable shell just as much. You have done all you can for her and it has clearly been an act of love. Hoping for peace and comfort for you.",2022-02-24 11:50:37,realblondee,t0fjfp
Dementia,How are you supposed to react?,"My grandma was diagnosed with early on-set a while ago. I'm not really sure how to react. I tried asking for advice and people told me that ""oh maybe she'll remember you"" or she would if i loved her, or that sometimes dementia patients remember things you wouldn't expect.

I know it's not easy for other people to comfort me or help me, but in that moment I felt so much like that ""advice"" was absolute bullshit. It felt like they were trying to feed me some romanticised version of dementia. I know that there are ups and downs with dementia and i'm not trying to take away the little silver linings people with dementia/caring for someone with dementia find. In that moment I just didn't want to hear about the bright side I guess. I don't really know how to cope. It feels like someone dumped a huge pile of information on me and now I look at her wondering how much is going.","Ohh, so sorry, it's horrid & hard to get that diagnosis early on, sucks.  It can hit people like a kind of grieving, shock, can take some processing, for feelings & thoughts to settle.  It's shit, huh.   Go with yr process, just try not to wallow in it too long I suppose.  When you're ready have a search around dementia .orgs & alzheimers .orgs, tons of great resources, info, etc. 

 My mum got diagnosis more than 10 yrs ago she still knows who everybody is.  Can't remember what anyone said just a few minutes ago, or that there's a pandemic on & why she's gotta wear facemask on the bus.  Keeps asking where's the dog who died 20 yrs ago already.   Still loves reading her old Shakespeare, can't follow a James Bond movie past "" good guys are trying to catch bad guys & everybody is double-crossing"".  But sure, many lose memory faster.  Sorry, OP, it sucks - is what it is eh!   \*  hugs  \*
So overwhelming for all involved.  Take time to just absorb this diagnosis then start reading up on the disease, not on forums, on medical sites.  The thing about dementia is it has it's own path with each person so you can get a generalized idea of what is to come but not really any kind of time frame.  Each person with dementia is different so each will have a different path.  The only thing you can do is get educated then just try to roll with what is happening.  My husband was diagnosed about 4 years ago so I understand what is happening to you and the confusion with information overload.  Good luck and I am sorry this is something impacting you and your family.
I’m sorry that you have to deal with that. In my experience, the thing that is really hard is that the more the disease progresses, the more you have to grieve little (or big) part of the person. It’s years of progressively loosing them. 

I don’t know if it could help you, but I found this grid in a paper about dementia. https://www.fhca.org/members/qi/clinadmin/global.pdf 

It gives an idea of things you can expect, but everyone is different and the disease is not so linear. Also, for the “recognizing” or “not recognizing” situation, it’s not so clear cut. My great aunt had a lot if trouble recognizing my father after the first year of pandemic since they did not see each other. But it got better now. And I see her every day or every other day and on a bad day, she can randomly confuse me with someone she just spoke on the phone with or a nurse, but will otherwise never have that problem on a good day (when her anxiety, sleep, and eating is under control). 

So no matter how much you love her or she loves you, it won’t make a difference. I hope you can come to term with the diagnosis and enjoy the moments you have with her. And don’t forget to get your own support system in place to help you deal with all that. ❤️
There's no right answer here.  Everyone's different and so how to cope is going to be personal to each of us.  I am still having a hard time that my mother remembers my ex-wife, current wife, my kids, my in-laws but often doesn't remember me!  Nice right?!  During other times she comes over out of the blue and treats my like she always had growing up; a window of clarity.  She knows who I am and remembers everything.  I try not to take it personally but $hit, my ex-wife?!  She still knows I am a familiar person and most of the time that I may or may not be her son.  She will often ask how many children she and I had together or ask if I am her husband.  

The point is - you can't compare the details or get comfort from someone who is going through it or others who have not.  You just need to relate to the feelings and find your own comfort there.  It can be really depressing but remember you are not alone in your feelings and the natural reaction from people is to try to be positive... and it often comes across as superficial bullshit but likely they care about you.  

I wish you peace, love and comfort friend...  I know I need it too.
I think it's hard for people to know what to say, especially if they haven't dealt with someone they love having dementia. The best way to ""react"" is to be yourself - you sound like a wonderful, loving grandchild. Coping with it depends on how you usually deal with adversity - some people research the heck out of it (me),  some go into denial, and some people just roll with it. There's so many ways to ""handle"" this - and the disease manifests itself so differently in each person. It's not a predictable thing. 

One thing I'm doing is just being grateful for every moment I get with my mother, even if things are really different and challenging. She hasn't forgotten my name yet, but it will probably happen. She knows I love her, and even if she doesn't know my name she knows she's safe with me. That's really all that matters.
It’s just like rest of the real world, you are not in control of what is going to happen, but you are in control of how you respond. My mom has dementia/Alzheimer’s, can’t remember what happened 20 min ago but remembers her family. This can be good and bad. If something is missing, must be me who stole it. At some point you have to acknowledge she is not the grandma you know, but you can still treat her as a friend and bring her joy, even if it’s just few minutes at a time.
With my mom, sometimes she thinks I'm someone else, but it's always someone she loves. Her sister, or my brother, etc. I'll take it. 

Try to remain calm and cheerful with her, tough as that is. She doesn't know it's the 30th time she's asked the same set of questions today. And it's not her fault she got caught in that loop. 

Try not to argue or contradict unless it's truly important. Try to join her in her reality, if you can. My mother is currently obsessed with her driver's license expiring.  She keeps saying she wants to be the driver tomorrow. I say, ""great idea, mama."" She's forgotten by the next day. She says, I really need to study the rules of the road so I can be ready for my test. I say, ""okay, whenever you're ready we can go take the test."" I know she's never going to pass even the vision test, let alone the road test. But I don't need to argue with her for the next six weeks about it. It would only upset us both.
My grandmother doesn’t always remember me. Sometimes she does sometimes she needs reminding. I was sad at first but I got used to it. Give her a lot of attention and love, even if she doesn’t really remember ; she sort of still does. I can’t explain it but I can tell my grandmother finds me familiar and is comfortable with me even on the days she doesn’t really remember me. It’s like her body , instincts tell hers that she knows me. You will understand what I mean once you experienced it.",2022-02-24 05:16:51,dumbass_disease,t07m88
Dementia,“I’ve faced my biggest fear. So why worry?”: Wendy Mitchell on living in the moment with young-onset dementia,,"My husband got dementia in his late 40s; he's 58 now. There is no cure; it does eat away. 
I lied to myself, thinking that the disease wasn't that bad; it is bad. I feel bad for her because she's probably not doing that well. You adapt to the shitty situation; now, I'm looking for a nursing home for him.
“People with dementia can teach those without it so much about enjoying their life!” she laughed. “I was as guilty as anyone when I was working: I wished for the weekend, I wished for the end of the day, I wished for the next holiday. You’re wishing your life away. The only certainty we have in this life is this moment, no one knows what the next moment will bring. So enjoy it.”  


Incredibly inspiring, and an unusual angle that you don't often read about it.
Good to know. 
everyone’s fucking miserable until our brains start to decay.",2022-02-24 04:43:08,she_wrote,t073bc
Dementia,I feel so guilty and i don't know what to do,"My mother (58 f) has dementia. I(24f) live abroad and this is the first time i am visiting her after her diagnosis. She was a bit lost the last time I came but wasn't properly diagnosed.

My father is her primary caretaker, my brother lives nearby. They both help her around. She is primarily in her early stages, can read and hold a conversation properly, for the most part. Is a bit lost and forgets things easily. 

When I am here i try to give her brain exercises that stimulate her. I am not sure even if they help her but make her a bit happy, and seems to make her a bit foccused. I leave next week and i feel so guilty. 

I don't know if i should stay here and take care of her. But i do know that staying here makes me depressed and i don't really take care of myself much. I have gained a couple of kgs in the past month. I am not good at working from here, which i have been doing, and have been lagging behind.
 
I don't know if i should leave my job, leave my life there and take care of her. I don't even know if it will actually make any difference. I can't help but feel guilty about leaving her here and getting on the flight next week.","I understand why you feel bad but leaving your job and life in order to care for your Mom is DEFINITELY not the right choice. You are too young, and this time in your life is too critical, for you to do such a thing plus, it’s not really necessary and it won’t change the outcome. I can’t imagine any mother wanting her child to do this. You can’t escape the pain and unfairness of this situation, but continuing on with your life will keep it from completely devastating you plus it will allow you to remain a daughter on your visits. When you become a caregiver, you stop being able to just be a daughter and I think your Mom really needs a non-caregiver loving and sweet presence in her life and that’s just what your role will be.
Yeh OP, so sorry, I get it, and I feel for you!    Yr dad is caring for yr mum, she's in her place, and you have a life somewhere else.  I was also overseas for many years after my mums diagnosis.  I visited every year for a couple months, called often & sent actual postcards & hard-copy photos regularly.   Surely yr mum wouldn't expect you to give up yr life & move back home, she'd want you to live yr best life.  She could be ok for years yet.  Yr dad is with her, & yr bro is nearby.   Go, get on that plane, don't feel guilty about that.     \* hugs \*
You are so young as is your mother, to be dealing with this, but it happens. I was in my fifties when my mom started having symptoms (60 now.) But I was still working in a very demanding job. I live about 4 hours away by car and would routinely make a short trip to visit every couple of months. It was never enough for my mom. She always thought I should move closer, but she understood I liked my job and I was successful, plus my husband (now 69) has slowly been losing his vision for the past few years and needed me. My dad was my mom’s caregiver until he died last year at 94.  He always insisted he could care for my mom and did until he passed. But I had to retire early due to health issues, but visited more often afterwards due to both my parents starting to have serious falls. Sorry for rambling but my point is, caring for a loved one with dementia is demanding, especially emotionally. I completely agree with the person who said your role is to be the happy face she sees, especially when things get more difficult. Make it a point to have regular discussions with your father and brother so you know how they are coping and if your help might be needed for them in the times to come.
Phone calls. You could still do memory games and keep her engaged. This time could also give your Dad a break.
Don't do it; being a caregiver, my life has gone to shit, mentally and physically.  It's a draining process with dementia. Don't uproot your whole life; the hole you fall into is deep and dark.
My grandmother has middle stage dementia, I moved back home for a month to be with her. Then covid happened , a month turned into 16 months , I’m married with no kids in another country 12 hours away. It was a nightmare with rollercoaster emotions , lots of anger and guilt because I felt I didn’t really help at the time but I actually did. ( Story for another day ) Guilt because I kept telling my husband that I was going to be back soon but i just kept delaying my flight. I didn’t see my husband for 16 months. I felt that a divorce was coming. It was a ridiculous time! I’m back home now and my grandmother is more or less stabilized. I’m really glad I stayed as long as i did and it didn’t ruin my marriage. I didn’t regret any of it. At the time , I was really unsure of my decision because there were other people taking care of her too. I kept telling myself I won’t regret this and to push through. I was right. But it’s different for everyone. Make a decision and make your peace. It feel like your decision makes more of an impact for you more than your mum. I speak to my grandmother on the phone every few days since I’ve been back. Also it’s not too late to move when she’s in the middle stage when your dad would probably need more help. Feel free to pm if you need to talk to someone.
If I had a choice I wouldn't do it. I'm around your age (25F) and I've been my dad's caretaker for \~4-5 years while my mom goes off to work. I haven't been able to graduate because I can't take classes, and I don't have a social life at all. I agree with the phone calls and socializing, I think your mom would really be happy about that -- and like bonbong said you can always move back when your family really needs the help.",2022-02-24 01:50:54,awesomeness_A,t04e6c
Dementia,Today wasn’t a great day,"for me but my aunt did fairly well. She got appropriately dressed by herself (it’s cold here today). Originally came out without socks but realized what she had done and came back out wearing with matching socks. The slippers didn’t match but they are the same style and similar colors so I called it a win. 

Me? Not so much. The awful animal noise at 3 am woke me up and I still think it sounded like a chihuahua had fallen off of the 6 foot fence and broke 2 legs. I went outside to check but couldn’t find anything. Maybe someone hit a dog on the street behind us?

I love the improvements taking Nameda is making for her. It’s not something I expected but with those improvements come dangers - like turning on the oven before she left the kitchen, opening the front door and saying she wants to go for a walk (I have an motion detection alarm) and trying to wash her clothes while I took a quick shower because I woke up 2 hours late because of said chihuahua screams. Walking with clothes dangling from her arms means she could trip while going down the 2 steps to the washing machine. Early bedtime for me tonight. Thanks for listening. Needed to vent.","🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽lost our dad to dementia in June. We had padlocks on the doors to keep him from random outside jaunts. He was faster than a speeding bullet easing out of the house…

Dementia,What do you think ?,"Back info: my mom is 67- the past two years she has drastically changed. For about four months she just straight up raged—screaming at us, if her phone didn’t work (bc she wasn’t operating it correctly) came and and threw it screaming up and down that she got sold a bad phone..I could go on and on. At this time she was also decreasing seraquil under doc supervision so we weren’t sure if rage was from that or could she possibly have dementia. She ended up getting in a car accident, which she does not take responsibility for however she must have gotten flagged by the dmv because she had to get tested for dementia, pass road test etc. she ended up passing it all and the memory tests came up more as red flags for dementia in the future if continues her lifestyle.

Fast forward 1 year later- the aggression is way better but she still is suspicious—she stopped her therapy (only went twice) bc her doc had her Credit card number and she claims she never gave it to him…
She looked at me and thought I was my aunt, twice. Was calling my husband by my uncles name. Asking same questions over and over. She didn’t sleep well for the last three days and this happened along w a UTI.

Oddly enough she is normal about three weeks out of the Month and that fourth week is confusion, agitating, perseverating on small things.
She also likes her pain medication.
I guess what I am asking is does this sound like dementia? Writing it out it does to me, just need more input any advise appreciated!

Also when she is in that state of mind she constantly is eating sugar…anyone else see the at correlation?","Even though brain fog does happen with menopause. yes, red flags. Multiple things you said track. Even down to the extreme sweet tooth which is a thing with Alzheimer’s patients. 

I assume when you say “called me by aunt’s name” did she immediately correct herself? (my mom has been calling me by her sister’s name, and then correcting herself, since i was as kid). Or like she literally thought you were a different person?

Aricept and Zoloft could help with her symptoms. 

Sadly if it is incurable dementia. The name of the game is damage control. 

Engaging in financial planning so that she’ll be eligible for Medicaid long term care (if USA). 

Planning for where will she live eventually. Because every fall and injury/hospitalization basically monopolizes the patient’s body’s energy, and accelerates the dementia. 

It is when patients live at home in their older house or split-level, which requires stairs and driving a car to functionally leave the house, that they become really isolated. Then if they don’t socialize; they forget how to, faster.

Checking her hearing as well. if she has hearing loss and it is not addressed with hearing aids, the dementia will happen more rapidly. Same issue, where it makes socializing more complicated less enjoyable, so it just doesn’t happen. 

If she moves into an accessible flat (roll-in shower, bidet toilet to prevent UTI) or a senior community in a walkable neighborhood with shops nearby, and has an aide to help cook and clean.. she can socialize, run low-risk errands to feel busy, and have a relatively normal-feeling life for many years.",2022-02-23 17:06:19,Acceptable_Box_6236,sztfla
Dementia,It seems like as soon as I come to terms with my moms symptoms there are new terrible ones added to the list,"My mom seems to be going down hill at a pretty rapid and consistent pace. I feel like I’m constantly stuck in a phase of mourning if that makes sense? I get used to the fact that she has difficulty with speech, then bam she starts having hallucinations. I think the hallucinations have to be the worst of it, then on top of them she’s no longer recognizing my family members. I know it’s only a matter of time before she constantly doesn’t know who we are. Things are only going to get worse and worse until the very end, and that starts an entirely new mourning period on top of all the bits and pieces of her I’ve lost throughout the years. In a way I feel like there will never be relief from the grip my moms dementia has on me","I am going through the same grieving process with my wife. Also the good days and bad days messes with me.
I'm in the same boat, OP.  It's really such a depressing struggle, isn't it?    


We understand what you're going through. My mom is declining very quickly too.  Come vent here anytime. We got you.
This might be a long one. Sorry. 
My father recently passed away, he had a mild form of parkinsons so had limited mobility, but he was a spry mother fucker. he took care of my mom, who in her late 60s developed alzheimers. they pretty much hid how bad it was. my dad became ill in september and passed away in october. i am a doctor, my only other family in this country aside from m+d is my sister, who, is a normal human being who is not in the medical field. my dad went from being able to take care of himself, to me bringing him home in a wheelchair, he was very deconditioned. he went from being able to eat, to not being able to drink or swallow as he went through the stages of dying. while i know what to expect, nothing prepared me for it. it was even worse for my sister. whenever we made an adjustment to the plan, every day, every hour was different. we went from him sleeping in his bed, to a hospice bed, to becoming incontinent, to being bed bound and me and my sister doing his at home hospice care. you can imagine. i had to really coach her through expectations and just being able to handle what was happening with him, while taking care of my mom who was very distressed as to why my dad wasnt eating. this was while moving them from NY to FL in the middle of his illness into my sisters house bc we recognized that they were not able to take care of themselves. my mother requires care 24/7. she is still ambulatory, but needs help getting dressed, showering, redirecting, eating/cutting food. you name it. its also heartbreaking to know that even though i talked to them every day, and was the sibling hwlping them through everything, my mother has no idea who i am. she does not understand why i can only visit on weekends, she doesnt understand i work full time etc. i took my mom to my apartment (i also recenly relocated to FL, temporarily, without my husband) and was so proud to share with her that their sacrifices to come to america were not lost, that we finally ""made it"". of course, she is not able to recognize that. she just kept asking me where we were, who i was, and if i was going to hurt her and kept asking me to go back to my sisters house because she was afraid she would get lost. 
its heartbreaking. 
sorry for the wall of text. this is a lot. hang in there. 
this is a horrible disease.
I feel this so deeply. Yes. Exactly this. Death by a thousand losses, and a grief to go with each. I’m trying to come to terms with the realization that it won’t end until her death however many years from now, and that tsunami of mounting grief until the wave crests is almost unbearable to contemplate. So, I’m just trying not to add to it as best I can.
I've cried so much and I always wonder if I'll have any tears when it's over😞 you are definitely not alone
Last April I was finally able to visit my parents after all of 2020 spent talking to them via the phone due to Covid. My dad had lost weight and was very tired. Understandable after caring for my mom who has Alzheimer’s. She had gone downhill so much in one year. Then my dad died a week later and I was mourning both my parents while taking care of my mom for three weeks until she was able to get into a memory care facility. So much of her had been lost already. And like the others here, I mourn a little more with each wisp of my mother that disappears when the disease progresses. I also wonder if I will have any tears left when she passes. I have told my husband if he sees me smile at her memorial he’ll know I am thinking of all the happy memories I have of her and that I know she is herself once again and she’s with my dad. Prayers for all of you and your loved ones. Let’s pray they find a cure for these awful diseases.
I truly believe there is never any relief at any time when dealing with this AWFUL DISEASE!!!!! There seems to be so many different layers! Like peeling an onion and you never stop crying. (No pun intended) I do have to agree that the hallucinations have to be the hardest to deal with as there’s no reality to them what so ever! Gosh, I can go on and on about this disease! I’ve been documenting my mother’s changes and behaviours like she’s some kind of science experiment!!! Ugh..🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m so EXHAUSTED!
Man. i feel you. my grandmother is now bedridden and on hospice for almost 6 weeks now. A few weeks ago, she was no longer able to consistently hold a sandwich and bring it to her mouth (when she says she wants to eat). 

Just today, she was drinking from a cup with a straw and did not have the energy to suck the liquid all the way up the straw. we had to cut the straw to one-third, and put the drink in a little sample cup, hold it to her mouth the whole time, and refill that a few times.  

So now someone has to bend over and spoon feed her and hold up a mini cup up to her mouth… even mealtime is not a shared pleasure at all,  it used to at least compensate for the horrible experiences of diaper changing. 

trying to make her feel comfy like there is no rush for any task, while also trying to actually get all the pragmatics done within a business day, while also trying to “enjoy” or appreciate the end, and mourning your own relationship… it is really hard to do all at once!!!!
The behavioral ones are the worst because it doesn’t even feel like the same person minus a few details. It’s not like they forgot who you are; but just accept your answer and roll with it. It’s not like the movies that show a graceful fading away, or cute videos that go viral, where they don’t recognize adult you, but feel happy to meet you all grownup.

No, their brain knows that something is not right, that it doesn’t feel comfortable or confident, it doesn’t know reality what it can trust anymore. and the anger gets directed at those spending day to day with them. They can feel like they are being gaslighted. “*This person didn’t use to hang around me every day, now you are, I didn’t used to feel so disoriented, now I do. therefore this family member there every day must be the cause of my problems, not a result.” *

gosh I am really sorry for dumping on you. I can delete the comment if it seems like i’m dog piling and stressing others out by reading this
You are not alone!
Yes, x100. We are constantly grieving with dementia. I can tell when my mom is on the precipice of another loss. Hold on loosely.
I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this.

My dad begun to show signs around this time last year, and died in December due to the rapid pace of his dementia. I didn't realise I was in a constant state of grief and gratefulness  until he passed. Now I really appreciate the time I had with him, and I even miss the difficult moments of caring for him.

Obviously everyone's relationship is different, and the way their parents etc react to dementia differs with each case. However I want you to know you aren't alone, and please take the time to also take care of yourself when you can. 

Document any moments that you know you'll appreciate in the future, remember to take pictures and videos, and enjoy each other's company when you can. 

*Wierdly enough my dad ended up sharing a lot of his past memories that he had never shared before(I'm assuming because of the hallucinations)
I lost my dad to cancer about 8 weeks ago after almost 2yrs of near 24/7 caretaking, and I found myself separating my emotions so that I could focus on what was I front of me. 

Unfortunately this was also while caring for my mother simultaneously so I was dealing with her forgetting why dad was sick, etc...I had to constantly remind her that he had cancer. 

""Why are at going to chemo?"" Cancer.

""Why are we having so many appointments?"" New treatments.

""What's wrong with my husband/your dad?"" He's dying, I'm sorry.

Every.single.day. It was heartbreak for me on all fronts because I am not a callous person at all. So much so that the only way I could be efficient with both caretaking tasks was by sacrificing my own mental health and emotion. 

My point for you is this: My experience led me to take on the concept of anticipatory grief, and to be honest it gave me a level of peace that I needed in order to get stuff done. I'm an engineer so I started just ""looking at the data"" on my dad whenever we got new news, and I would tell myself he is not getting better (he was stage 4 by the time he was diagnosed) and I needed to prepare to take over the family for him. Same with my mom...new habits, increased anxiety, whatever. It's all just data that's giving me what I need to anticipate and accept that her decline is imminent and I need to prepare. It helps me delineate between what's worth my time and what isn't. I capitalize on every lucid moment she has and just enjoy her company, and if she isn't lucid and lashes out at me I just tell myself ""you've prepared for this, it's not her it's the disease"".

This shit is rough for all parties involved. I'm sorry that you're going through it but know that there are others out there going through something similar and we're all there for each other.",2022-02-23 16:48:44,_constantly_eating_,szt01o
Dementia,Question about durable POA,I was able to get my grandmother to willingly sign POA paperwork on a good day and have it notarized. What do I need to do with it other than get copies? Probate office?,"Have an electronic copy in your email. When my mom had to go into the hospital or see a new dr, being able to email the POA right then and there so they had proof I could make decisions made everything a lot easier.
Varies by state. What you need to do is get an attorney involved to ensure the paperwork is correct and will hold up and they'll let you know where it needs to go.
Make sure that the places you will need to use it, such as her bank, will accept it.
Usually there's two poas signed in front of two witnesses...that's how my Dad did his. It was in his lawyers office and they stamped the back of every page - as photocopies will not be accepted by some...notably his bank.
Social security does not accept POA, so there is another process there.  Bless you for taking care of her.",2022-02-23 14:55:24,R60Z33,szqb6s
Dementia,Suggestions,My grandma thinks that my  clothes and shoes I wear are hers is there anything I can say that won't make her mad?,"idk. It’s hard to say what does and doesn’t upset them.

Dementia,"""Your treating me like a child""","My father gets upset and tells me that I am treating him like a child. He's in the early stages of dementia. He still has the ability to: get dressed, get ready in the morning, shower, use bathroom, handle money, most life skills. At this point he does not have a license, I do the cooking and cleaning and driving and reminding. What usually instigates this statement is when he says he is feeling dizzy/has low blood pressure. I ask him to sit down or take it easy. Sometimes not even 10 minutes later he wants to: Do yardwork outside, take a walk around the block outside

 Out of fear for his safety I have to try to convince him not to do [insert strenuous outdoor activity here]. He has no history of falls, luckily. It makes me feel terrible, as I believe I have good intentions. Any advice on this? Deflecting onto another topic doesn't seem to be a solution. He will remember that he wanted to do [insert strenuous outdoor activity here]. My only other solution might be bringing in someone like a nurse or carer who doesn't have a relation to him like I do. But that seems expensive for what I need out of it.","What happens if he goes for a walk or starts working in the yard?  Maybe it's OK to just keep an eye on him and assist him if he over-exerts himself, rather than stop him from doing it at all.
Could you do a less strenuous version of his desires — maybe go for a low-key walk around the block with him? Or is that not feasible? (I can think of a number of reasons why it wouldn't be, or maybe the desire would persist every 10 minutes anyway.)
Take a page out of the Teepa Snow playbook and apologize. Tell him you are sorry for treating him like a child, but you are worried about him and don't want him to get hurt. If he is feeling dizzy try giving him electro lights, Gatorade or Propel, and a salty snack. Then he can go for a walk or rake leaves.
I empathise. My dad has called me, crying, asking to be picked up because he couldn't walk 200m down the road. He's also thrown a fit because I told him he shouldn't walk 2km (10x further!!) without his walking frame because what if something happens.


I think, especially as the daughter, a lot of dementia patients dismiss us. My dad is a proud Boomer man. He doesn't need me to help him - until he does, and then I'm a bad person if I can't/don't.
""No, I'm treating you like a XX-year-old man, you need to take it easy *because* you are not a kid anymore.""  

A female version of that sometimes works with Grandma.
Does the dizzy only happen when he's standing up?",2022-02-23 12:58:32,Easy_Consequence_848,sznl0j
Dementia,Tips for taking blood sugar from a non-cooperative late stage Alzheimer's family member?,"The doctor has taken my grandfather off the diabetes meds (Metformin, Glypizide), and so we have to check his blood sugar more than we have been, and more frequently than the hospice nurse visits. 

Today went ok, but he was *not* happy about the finger prick. I'm picturing a day when he won't even give me his finger.","I work as a visiting hospice registered nurse case manager. Unless the doctor or family has a concern for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia or maybe trouble to see the symptoms and the cash to problem early we try to let families know to just stop checking the blood sugar or maybe check here and there. I do recommend discussing this issue with your hospice nurse.
[deleted]
You may want to get a professional to help you or increase visits to include the checking of his blood sugar. 

My grandma is very specific about who she listens to. If her doctor tells her to drink water, she’ll ignore him but if her grandkids tell her, she listens. But if she needs medication she refuses to listen to and take it from anyone but a doctor (A normal example of that is she won’t even take Advil for a headache). 

There’s not a straight answer but I wish you the best.
See if you can get a cgm. The freestyle libre is the one we use and it’s awesome. I just wave my phone by the sensor to get a reading and change the sensor every two weeks.
Hi- I am a type 1 diabetic (I use a cgm AND finger sticks) and my 89-year-old MIL who has severe dementia is a type 2 diabetic (she uses finger sticks). She HATED finger sticks when I used her lancet device (jerking hand away/showing fear and agitation). I started using my lancet device on her (with new, sterile lancet inserted), and she was MUCH more comfortable with the process (I ended up ordering one for her because it worked so much better for her regarding acceptance- unfortunately my lancet device is no longer made but I was able to find a substitute that was nearly identical- I got her the E-Z Pull &Click Lancing Device on Amazon). One of the biggest shockers I discovered was that her former device was set on the hardest/deepest puncture setting, so no wonder she hated that device (another in-law who rotates MIL care with us originally got the former device and used that setting for her mom)! Even when I changed the puncture setting for the original device she was negatively conditioned even to the sight of it! So I tested the new device on myself and adjusted it to the minimally-needed depth for MIL- that worked out so much better! The cgm is a wonderful tool for me (I use the Dexcom g6), but I don’t know how dementia patients would respond to it- you would definitely need to place it in an area where it couldn’t be removed by the patient (maybe back of the arm or on the back of the hip). Also, inserting a new sensor every 10 days (......or 20 if you can manage to restart it through a hack) might prove challenging/upsetting for the patient, and the “alert alarms” for high and low blood sugar levels on the receiver could be frightening for the patient if they go off (the receiver needs to be within a certain distance from the cgm to be able to record blood sugar levels). It might not be impossible to use with dementia patients, but it is also not without its own difficulties. I wish you good luck!
What helped with my grandmother was distraction - letting her watch TV, one person talks to her and another person tests her sugar levels, putting on noise canceling headphones and letting her get busy in listening to the music",2022-02-23 11:51:26,NumberFiveAlive,szm093

Dementia,"Paranoia, delusions, and aggression in a memory care unit.","My grandfather (Papa) has alzheimer's. My mom has POA. Papa is currently in an Assisted Living/Memory Care facility. 

Recently, he's started having delusions that ""someone"" is out to kill his kids or himself and is calling my mother literally 20+ times a day in a panic. He's also threatened to punch staff at the facility for telling him he has to leash his dog. My mom said he has his ""meltdowns"" in the afternoon. It sounds like he is highly agitated and getting aggressive. So much so that the facility has told my mom that something will have to change or he cannot live there anymore. To say my mom is stressed out is an understatement.

My mom has had Papa tested for a UTI and a couple other things. That's the first thing we thought of, but those tests came back normal. I believe he is on Zoloft currently, and I want to say something for high blood pressure as well. 

I think there's a concern for my mom with ignoring the phone calls that he'll get more agitated if she doesn't answer, and redirect his anger to the staff. But she is at her wit's end. 

So I have two questions: What can she say to him on these phone calls to calm him down, if anything? And does anyone have any medication (or other type of) advice?","I would tell her to tell him that something along the lines of she talked to the police and they assigned units outside of everyone's houses etc. To protect them no one is going to hurt anyone. If she can find out who he is worried about tell him that the police found them and took them away everyone is safe. 
And as far as medication goes. My grandmother was going through the same thing and hospice prescribed Depakote, and xanax. It has helped a TON! Also another thing to consider is pain. They often don't have the ability to express their pains or discomforts which can lead to  odd behaviors. Including those behaviors that you have listed above. You may also want try adding a daily dose of Tylenol to his meds morning and evening to help ease anything he might be experiencing and unable to tell anyone about.  One of the hospice nurses told me about a year long study she did in a dementia memory care facility. During that time they were studying the effects of unmanaged pain. 8-10 patients who began pain managment regime were able to slowly get off the anti psychotic meds because their moods were more stabilized. So something to think about as well. I would also ask the facility how he has been sleeping. Lack of proper sleep can also drive those behaviors as well. Trazadone is a medication used to help sleep. ( recently added this for my grandmother as well) it's like night and day she's still obviously suffering the cognitive decline but the aggression, restlessness, paranoia etc is basically gone at this point because of the new meds that we have added through hospice. 
I'm so sorry you guys are going through this. Please keep your heads up.
Your mom needs to have him evaluated by his PCP. She should also ask for a referral to a geriatric psychiatrist. This also sounds like sundowning since it starts in the late afternoon. Maybe family can call him before he escalates and come up with a fib? Police investigating, alarm system installed - hard to say what might work. It will be trial and error.
Is it possible that it's time to move him from assisted living to a long term care facility?",2022-02-23 09:34:40,valdra,sziwt6
Dementia,My Grandma Is Losing It...,"So, we have noticed small things with her in 2019. After my papa (her husband) died it just got worse.. She was talking to herself in the beginning about stuff and we picked up on that. Now she just makes no sense whatsoever and it's hard to be around her because she is so mean if you have a different opinion. I have worked around people with dementia and I rolled with what they're seeing from day to day, but this is a family member. I wasn't too close with my grandma to begin with, but this is really making it hard. She doesn't want to go anywhere with my mother and I anymore. She has been very mean about her religion. She uses papa (the one person I was closest to and the one male figure I had to a dad) to get us to convert to Christianity saying that we obviously don't love him because we are going to hell. I'm glad he doesn't have to see his wife like this. It would make him sad. It's been rough.

She tried to run away to California to marry some guy. She stopped that. She is too lucid to be taken to a hospital without trying to run away again. We are trying to keep her as safe as possible, but it's so hard because this woman can be so stubborn. I love her, but it's been hard to be around her. Yesterday she told us that she is ""taking a stand against dementia, diabetes, my food allergy, and many more genetics passed down in the family."" She has diabetes and she believes she is getting healed. I am worried she will stop taking medication because she hears a voice in her head telling her to stop taking them because she is all better. She freaks out at me when my food is touching sealed containers of my allergen.

She isn't the woman she used to be and it's been hard to deal with. She won't listen to my mom and I because she only listens to men. She doesn't care if it's important advice, she will only listen if it's from a man. She used to listen before it got this bad. Now she is following my uncle who has only two good brain cells and despite this woman having issues falling asleep, memory, and she is hallucinating; he gives her the keys to his car. He doesn't listen to us so she is getting really bad advice from a man who has no idea how to take care of himself without his mother being there. He told us he does not care about what happens to his mother if she gets hurt or hurts someone else. She has gotten into small accidents on the road with NO idea how they happened. My uncle also says that ALL people with dementia and Alzheimer's are the same, so she cannot have dementia because she isn't acting like the people at the home or like my papa. I am worried about her. I'm tired of him not caring about her. She stopped taking showers. She smells like a barn.. I have no idea how to tell her to take a shower because we have tried a lot of things!! Including just telling her to try taking a bath in the evening to relax. I'm just out of ideas.. It's making me sad seeing her deteriorating like this and so fast!",,2022-02-23 02:26:02,LilMissBunny69,szbg9w
Dementia,"Mom has Lewy and won’t give me POA. Thanks, Capgras.","First time posting here. It’s only been about two weeks since my mom got diagnosed with DLB after having a psychotic episode, and every moment since then has been a struggle. She regularly has hallucinations and delusions, but refuses to believe they aren’t real. 

She just admitted to us tonight that the reason she’s been so adamantly against giving me POA is because sometimes I am possessed by one of the demons that she sees and now she doesn’t trust me anymore. So I guess now we’re going to have to try to get guardianship over her instead, before she tries to give POA to god knows who.","[deleted]
Ugh, sorry you are in this boat. DLB is a beast. Guardianship can take a year and unlike a POA it requires her to be too incapacitated to manage her own affairs (and judges want it to be irrefutable, i.e. extremely obvious and bad). I can only imagine her reaction when she gets notice from the court of your petition - it will play right into her hallucinations. Hopefully, you can find a good geriatric psychiatrist to start treating symptoms.",2022-02-23 01:03:59,TheAgentKaye,sza2z3
Dementia,Has anyone ever gotten better?,"Not completely cured, just managed their symptoms and became a little better and managed to stay there.","OP.. don’t for a second think they will get better. They won’t. THERE IS NO CURE, just managed expectations.

I dropped the ineffective “meds” and placed my mother on an antidepressant to manage mood swings. This was the best decision I made. I know she is still going to decline but at least I don’t have a moody parent to care for and can reason with her. 

She took a fall in January and my stepson found her in front of the her house. She spent a week in the hospital with a concussion and swelling around the brain. She then spent a 3 weeks at a skilled nursing facility. Since she has been home physically therapy and occupational therapy have been a godsend to keep her somewhat independent, however this is just delaying the inevitable. Manage expectations.
Dementias are all terminal. There are diseases that mimic the symptoms and those cause deleriums which can be treated and sometimes cured.
My aunt suddenly got much worse but she’s been doing remarkably better since she’s been taking Nameda for 2 weeks. She’s talking in complete sentences and we’re actually having conversations again in the mornings. She’s less talkative in the afternoon and evening as she gets tired but she will begin taking a 2nd Nameda pill in another 10 days so we are hopeful.
No :( unfortunately it is a degenerative disease. Certain meds like Aricept (donepezil) and Nameda (memantine) can help slow down the process, but won’t cure the disease itself.
My grandma had huge swings early on. She had long periods of normalcy and lived independently till age 93. At times, she did so well I thought she was misdiagnosed and that I ruined her life unnecessarily. But no, it didn’t last too long.
Unfortunately no. Dementia is called the shrinking brain disease. There are medications that may slow the progression but that’s temporary. It only gets worse. We took care of our dad at home 2 1/2 years 24/7, he died in June on hospice care
My husband scored 13/30 on the MMSE right after we got married. Now he scores around 22/30. Good medical care and home support definitely helps. 

I put him in an adult day center and it’s stimulating his brain in ways that I can’t do at home. He would watch TV all day. 

However, as others have said, this disease is terminal. He is declining. Most of my support group friends have lost their loved one after a fall. That’s my biggest concern as my husband’s eyesight and peripheral vision aren’t good.
There is a brain stimulation study where there is a small group of people who got better after having mild cognitive impairment. T don’t know how it happened though. There hasn’t been anything similar reported for dementia unfortunately.
Of course, all the time. However, I must preface this by saying it depends on what is causing the dementia. “Dementia” is just a classification based on symptoms that include memory loss, difficulty in planning events, etc. and varies in severity. If it’s caused by a mild concussion or alcoholism, it can be reversed. However, if the dementia is caused by diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Lewey Bodies, then unfortunately it is progressive with no current treatment that is approved that offers reversal.
My dad was pretty stable for about 6 years after diagnosis.  He declined, slowly but surely, but was able to be  pretty independent.  However, about 15 months ago, he started declining at a much faster pace.  Even as recently as 4 months ago, he could take his dog for a walk on his own (although we had a gps device in his pocket, “just in case”.  Now he really can’t function at all without help and direction.  😪
I've been looking after my mother for 3.5 years and in that time it seems like she had improved. When I started caring for her she didn't talk and didn't walk much, now she can talk and read, go for walks and can do simple tasks again. She hasn't got much of her memory back yet, though I'm working on it. When she starts getting her short term memory back I'll provide my solution in full. She's around stage 5 or 6 on the alzheimer's chart.
No. Unfortunately it’s all downhill except in very rare cases when the cause of the dementia is curable or treatable.
To be fair, my mum has. Mainly because she's now in full time care, is no longer drinking and eats at regular times etc. 

Because she was an alcoholic all her life, her assessment period before going into care was extremely lengthy. I was told this is because alcoholism can cause an illness very like dementia. So they need to assess over months without alcohol to make sure it is in fact dementia and not this other temporary, alcohol related thing.

My mum will continue to deteriorate though, just maybe a bit slower now.
Unfortunately not. 
All dementia is terminal and very unpredictable. They can last up to 20 years after diagnosis or a few months and all in between.
They put mum on all kinds of meds to 'manage' it but it does very little.
I eliminated those completely and chose to ask her geriatrician to put her on anti depression and anxiety meds. I took care of her for 6 years with alzheimers. She's just recently gone into permanent care due to my health decline.
She was much 'easier' to manage and give her some quality of life while just on those meds. She's a happy little content lady now.
My mom is on Namenda. It’s a degenerative disease and won’t ever improve, like COPD. They don’t heal from it unfortunately. She’s a bit more lucid now but she started hitting people and staff. There’s a give and take with every medication.",2022-02-23 00:32:59,awesomeness_A,sz9i99
Dementia,Driving dilemma,"My 75 year old mom still lives at home independently (with regular help from my sister, me and family friends). She was officially diagnosed earlier this month with dementia — a diagnosis we knew was coming for more than a year. 

She lives (for now, alone) in our family home, in the same neighborhood for 50 years, since she was 25 years old. She is very private and extremely independent; she insists on doing everything herself. She has has never really even had a cleaning service in her home even though she has the resources. She increasingly struggles with word recall, can’t hold a full conversation like she used to, doesn’t complete projects, rarely cooks, no longer calls people, has donated inordinate amounts of money to random causes, receives piles of fundraising solicitations each day, and has been financially scammed numerous times over the past 18 months. She can no longer operate a computer or use an iPhone to call an Uber.

How do we begin transitioning her to not driving anymore? Her close friend confided in me that he witnessed her mistaking the brake for the gear shift. In another incident, her car broke down while I was with her, and she was not fully able to explain to the driver from the towing company what had happened. She goes to the grocery store, church and other local errands.

Is it better to wait a while longer, or forcibly take her keys and risk she will feel betrayed?

My hope is that her doctor, at the next appointment in three weeks, will submit the paperwork to the California DMV notifying them that she has had a dementia diagnosis.

But how long does this process last, and what is involved?
Will her license just be cut off? Or will she be asked to come in and re-test?

My sister and I feel it is better to take a chance and wait for the doctor’s decision, as it is better for her to channel her negative reactions at the doctor than at us. Would welcome thoughts and advice.","Don’t wait. What if she kills someone? Call her doctor, share this information them make an appointment for her. Ask the doctor be the bad guy who tells her she can’t drive. Don’t wait. She could run over some little kid tomorrow.

My aunt is going thru the same thing. I took her keys before she was officially diagnosed  and told her if she wants to drive, she has to take that AAA driving school and pass their test.
Don't wait.  Disconnect the battery cables immediately.  Taking their license often does nothing if they have access to a working car, they'll just drive anyway and then you have the nightmare of an accident with an uninsured, unlicensed driver (been there, done that, paid the not-so-small fortune).  Someone will have to enforce the driving ban and I guarantee that it won't be the police or the doctor but you.  Waiting to avoid conflict won't work here.
Don't wait. My mom went for breakfast at IHOP, this was during covid so it was pick up only. Well she got lost and I got a call from border patrol at 4 am that she was at the Canadian border about 2.5  hours away in a pretty remote part of WA state. One wrong turn and she could've been lost in the wilderness. Picked her up and the food was still there in her back seat Un eaten almost 24 hrs later.
[deleted]
You think it's better to take a chance that she gets in an accident *with someone else* and maybe hurts or kills them?* 

You don't have to get into a power struggle with her by taking away the keys. You can disconnect the battery so it won't start when she gets in it. You leave a little note inside it where the mechanic will see it, saying she has dementia and should not drive, and to please tell her they are waiting for a part to make repairs. Best would be if they could tow it to their shop and park it until she's past the driving urge. There's a whole subreddit here somewhere that discusses this but I am not sure where. Maybe a search will turn it up. Mechanics encounter this often enough they write about it on reddit.
We also live in California and discovered with my dad that doctors are mandated to report to the DMV certain diagnoses:  Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, etc (see California Health & Safety Code Section 103900).  My dad got a letter from the DMV notifying him that a report was made and summoning him for evaluation (written and driving test).  He was furious and threatened to go to the media to report this invasion of his privacy (LOL!).  We were delighted since it took the decision out of his or our hands.  Needless to say, he did not pass the test - actually, he passed the written test (after being further quizzed orally by the DMV test giver) but he failed the driving test.  To be honest, we thought he would be safe enough driving with restrictions (no freeway, no nights, within 5 mile radius of house…) and we applied for a restricted license for him.  However, the evaluation was scheduled for 4 months in the future and, by then, he had accepted his non-driving status and had kind of forgotten about driving.  If his doctor doesn’t report him on his own, you might want to call the office and suggest it.

We found a great service that helped him for the next year or so that he was living independently.  It is called GoGo Grandparent.  My dad couldn’t order an Uber or taxi because he couldn’t operate the phone apps.  GGG is a phone-based service that acts as an intermediary between the car service and the passenger.  He would call them and they had his records so knew where he lived, etc.  Say he wanted to go to church.  He would call them and they would order an Uber or Lyft.  They would tell the driver that the passenger was elderly and needed additional help (make sure that they are dropped off at the exact address for example).  They would tell my dad that “Julio in a white Camry is in your driveway”.  After church, he would call them and they would already know where to pick him up.  They would make all the payments and then charge my Dad’s on file credit card.  I think they add something like 10 cents a mile as their fee.  Every time he called them, I would get a text.  I then got updated texts when he was picked up, dropped off, etc.  Of course, the elderly passenger does still need to be able to make a voice call. My dad lost that ability a while back so this service would no longer works for him, but it was a godsend for about a year and a half, and helped the transition from being able to drive independently.
Absolutely do not wait. She is a liability for herself and others on the road. She will be come in to test, and pass an in person behind the wheel test, but it is time to take the keys or at best, remove the batter cable so the cad doesn’t start. 

It’s also time to arrange the financial house by getting a POA. My mother was forced to give up driving because her license just expired and couldn’t pass the test. On reflection she couldn’t pass the test because her dementia had started.

Do not wait for the doctor. If anything the doctor should reinforce the decision and ask to speak to the nursing staff ahead of time and send in the paperwork ahead of time. It’s for her own good, and others on the road.
Being able to remain ""on her side"" and shift the blame to the MD/the DMV/rules is much better for you. Women probably handle it better than men, but this is usually not a ""transition"" or a ""one and done"" change. They are forced to stop driving completely and immediately with no exception and then there are angry arguments about it for months as they attempt to continue to drive. Unless your Mom voluntarily decides to give up her license and stop driving, she'll go in for a test after the DMV gets notification from her MD. You'll have to wait for them to respond to the doctor's letter and then wait for appointment scheduling. But once she gets the initial letter from the DMV, or even notice from the MD of his plan, I think you have a good opportunity to repeatedly tell her ""the law says you're not allowed to drive until you get the okay from the DMV"" and then cite all the bad things that can happen to her if she's caught (name a large fine and jail time). Can you make yourself available to go places with her until that time in order to minimize her driving?  Depending on your situation, you could do something to the car (such as unhook a battery cable) to make it non-functional and then play dumb and delay when she seeks your assistance to get it repaired. If she's still able to contact someone for a repair herself, that won't work. Another option is borrowing her car and then telling her you had an accident or something else is wrong with it and give excuses to delay giving it back to her.  You can't just take her keys or take her car unless you have legal documentation that shows you have a right to do that (if you think she could cause a stink and contact the police as some parents do...)

It sounds like it's equally important to stop her access to her finances. Hopefully you are taking care of that now? A huge amount of irreversible damage, that affects her future care and wellbeing, can be done in a small amount of time if you don't jump on that quickly. Again, you need to be POA or legal guardian.
I went through something similar. It’s very difficult.

I would not count on the doctor just sending off a form to the DMV to revoke the license. Hopefully it will be that easy for you. But, if there is any confusion with the doctor on the matter,  I would specifically ask for an “occupational therapy driving evaluation“. This is a formal test of cognitive function as well as reaction time. I had one done for my mother one and it was done at one of the rehabilitation hospitals. It was an out-of-pocket expense for me.

That will help everyone with a more objective evaluation of the situation. To get the ball rolling. I’m sure she will fail. Mine did too.

After that, I agree with all the comments above. I personally removed the car from her vicinity but told her it was not sold and she can have it as soon as she “gets better“ and can pass the test. Oh yes, she was very angry that she failed the test. She was even angrier that she said she didn’t understand that she wasn’t going to be able to drive afterwards. Whatever. I did this because I know I would not be able to with myself if she killed her self or somebody else on the road.

Good luck.
I'm in a similar place with my 84 (turns 85 in March) mother. She's lives alone and has been independent up until a fall in November, which resulted in a brief ICU stay for a small brain bleed, that resolved on its own. This started the process of getting her a closer doctor (she had been going to one that relocated too far away, but liked her and kept going) and then a Neuro consult. The Neurologist diagnosed her with Dementia, ordered an MRI and has also recommended a full Neuropsych workup, but I'm not sure I want to put my mom through that. She lives alone in a 3-level Townhome, actually moves around really well (yeah, I know the fall makes it sound otherwise), keeps the house clean, cooks, and drives to her local errands (Groceries, Drug Store, Church, and even does a longer ""visiting the graves"" weekly). I'm checking-in daily via phone and weekly in-person to sort her pill-box, check her food, pay her bills, throw out junk mail, etc. - she still uses a computer (I'm in IT and it's locked-down HARD), cell phone, and her land-line.

Anyway, that all sounds good, but she has been getting worse. She used to volunteer at a hospital, but they stopped that after the November fall and didn't try going back until last week, then insists she was ""just visiting"". Her driving has only ever been an issue if/when she need to go anywhere ""new"" - I take her to these things. Her car has NAV and she still knows how to use it - mainly the ""Go Home"" button, in case she get's lost. She actually drives really well (I've followed her a few times to church to see), but it's a ticking clock...I know she needs to stop. Her license comes-up for renewal in March and will require a road test, so she may not pass it...or she probably will. The Neurologist wouldn't agree to outright pull her driving, just told her to limit that - which we have.

Unrelated, we are looking at assisted living and she is mostly receptive to the idea...since she craves being around other people and feeling useful. This is so hard.
I had that same exact problem in California. Told the Doctor, and he submitted a form to the DMV. The DMV then sent my Dad a letter that he had 30 days to come in for a test, or his license would be suspended. He hid the letter and I let it hide (lol). 

When his license was suspended, we were able to stop him from driving by simply taking his keys. He no longer had the understanding to get around that. About a year later, I was going to the DMV to deal with some of his car registration issues and he insisted I take him. I did. In between his ranting and raving at the DMV counter, the person helping us felt sorry for me and took care of all my problems. And Dad, sadly, never was able to get his license or drive again.

Over time, their world gets smaller and smaller. It feels like we are doing it to them, but in reality, it is inevitable. Good luck and take time for yourself.
I hate to put it in a financial way, but one bad accident and resulting lawsuit could wipe out her remaining resources and then where would you be?",2022-02-22 23:40:54,apatheticpurple,sz8hwa
Dementia,Finding Clinical Trials More Easily,"Hi all!

We are a group of graduate students at Stanford looking to better understand patients' experiences with clinical trials.

Specifically, we’re working on a project that aims to match people with trials more quickly and easily than many of the existing, cumbersome methods.

We’ve created a survey (below) that we hope gives you the chance to voice your own experiences finding therapies that work. We know that living with any disease or chronic condition is exhausting (never mind finding a trial), so we’re extremely grateful for the time you take to fill out this survey.

Of course, your privacy is extremely important, so all information is collected anonymously (unless you choose to provide your email for followup). Please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Dementia,for those dealing with a loved one with dementia,"this might be long, but ig its bc im really passionate abt it. I am an activity assistant at an assisted living community for elders with dementia, and have been for almost three years. My job is to engage them in meaningful activities basically to keep their brains awake and running and hope to slow the process. Spending full days with these residents, talking to them and playing games with them among other things, they've become my family. my second set of grandparents. I love them, and they love me too, and don't ever fail to express that to me. it is so incredibly rewarding.

The worst part, however, is easily when they pass away. I cry so hard. I think about them everyday, I'm almost tearing up now just thinking about them. I mourn for their families, they knew it was coming, but it always feels too soon when its a loved one. Sometimes you never know when your last goodbye will be. The disease is scary, and unpredictable. 

But, if you have a loved one with dementia, here is some advice for you. When someone has dementia, it means their brain is decaying, and somewhat shrinking. There are certain things that can increase your risk of getting dementia, such as mental illness, alcohol abuse, etc. To care for someone with dementia, you need empathy, patience, and compassion. 

one thing I've noticed is that, when I ask a resident ""Can you help me?"" they almost always are willing to help. they want to feel useful. sometimes they are aware of having dementia sometimes they are not, but regardless, they want to feel as though they have a purpose still. helping to fold napkins or laundry, organizing silverware, drying the clean dishes, measuring the flour when we bake cookies, they are typically willing to help out. it makes them feel good. 

you cannot lose your patience and take it out on them. sometimes you have to just walk away for a moment and take a deep breathe, and try again. approach them warmly with a smile. keep them occupied, books, magazines, puzzles, crosswords. step into their world and help them to reminisce. ask them about their morals and values and beliefs. ask them what their opinion is on something. compliment them. it can help to slow the decline. not many people have time for this, and then turn to nursing homes and assisted living communities. it sort of depends. 

families tend to be in denial quite often, and it's most likely because they don't know much about the disease itself. research helps. 

the takeaway, as I said before, is to have patience, and put yourself in their shoes. when they need help to be showered or toileted, they start to lose their sense of dignity. we don't know how that feels, but that doesn't mean we can't make an effort to get a better understanding of what they are going through.

and if you do decide to turn to an assisted living community, really do your research fo find the place that fits best for your loved one.

thanks for reading, if anyone has questions I may have an answer.","> My job is to engage them in meaningful activities basically to keep their brains awake and running and hope to slow the process.  

I admire you and others who have the patience and energy to do this on a consistent basis. I love my mother, but the last thing I want at this stage is to slow the process. I may be callous and selfish, but I truly feel like her passing will be a massive relief both for her and for the people who love her.
I admire you as well. 

One thing I would like to point out, though, is that choosing this work and doing a fabulous job of it, is not the same as living with someone who is your spouse/relative/parent. You get to go home. You can concentrate on them full heartedly when you are there because that is your job. Caregivers must work, raise children, make meals, pay bills, run a household on their own, AND take care of that person.

Sometimes compassion is short.

I’m not meaning to sound witchy. Maybe I’m too embroiled in it currently to see what you are seeing.

I am very glad you are out there and so caring. When my husband is ready for a nursing home I pray he has someone with your strength and respect caring for him. Thank you for what you do!
Oh, wow. Your post really pisses me off. I know you mean well. Let me explain.

I’ve worked with older adults who have dementia for the majority of my career. I’ve also been caring for my mom who has dementia for the past 4.5 years; she lives with us. So I know the difference between working with people who have dementia and being a caregiver for a person with dementia.

Do you really think family caregivers don’t know the dementia 101 information you posted? We live this daily. We need support - real support. Not some sanctimonious professional coming here to tell us “you cannot lose your patience and take it out on them.” Save it for your staff in-service. It’s great that you have a rewarding job that you love. The world needs people like you…but don’t come here and preach to caregivers who live this life 24/7. Don’t give us trite advice to “have patience.” It’s condescending as fuck.
Thank you. As one who lost their father to Alzheimer's and am seeing early signs of cognitive impairment, it's heartening to know people like yourself are in the trenches. Again, thank you for being there, and for sharing.
Thank you. Appreciate these words. Watching my mother navigates life with dementia in an aged care facility is heartbreaking. I wish to be there to care for her..
Thank you. 
I visit my grandma at her home on tuesdays with my toddler. My aunt lives with grandma and is a care taker, but also a hoarder from before I was even born… or at least since I was like 8, and I’m 30 now. 

My aunt got mad at me for moving some things around while I was there, mostly because my kid was grabbing everything. I brought some pictures of grandma with my kid, decorated her spot with them and some pretty rocks My kid found in the house. 
I come back and they’re gone. It’s a double whammy at that house and it’s bad. I am sad. 

Grandma tries, I ask her some questions about what she liked when she was a kid. I have my kid ask her her favorite colors and animals. Is there something common in your experience that people with dementia like to talk about? She will just read something random, like the name of an outdoor light fixture that’s in the kitchen(hoard), and say “it’s a good show” (like… the box is a good show??)


I don’t want her to sit around and watch tv. I’m going to try and do more outside stuff with her once it gets warmer. I wanted to bake strawberry shortcake and food with her but the kitchen is a messy hoard. I’m going to try and see if her home aid will bring her to my house or something, so we can bake or paint or something. I’m just incredibly sad, and new to it all.
I yelled at my dad once before I knew he had it. I still feel guilty even though I know he doesn't remember. He lives in a facility now and thanks to you and people like you who have the patience to do that job. We were thinking of keeping him home but his day-to-day experience is enhanced because of caring people like you. I really can't thank you enough.
Thank you so much for what you do.
Everything you said is true. We took care of our dad for 2 1/2 years in his home, round the clock. There are five of us. We kept him engaged doing anything for as long as we could. Rides to the carwash, down state street, thru the park. His barber came to the house to cut his hair. The deacons came every first Sunday, until covid, to pray with him and serve communion. My sister's stylist would come to do her hair and she would give daddy a shampoo also. We sang, we watched family feud (for some reason he loved it), anything we could think of until the disease finally took him away

You have truly found your calling

Dementia,reducing shadowing/codependency? (crossposting my own post from Alz),"my mother was codependent with my father before he passed away.  they both exhibited narcissistic behaviors as well.  she gained some friends before her dementia really increased, and then she effectively stopped all of those relationships because of paranoia.

So now she shadows me (i’ve lived with her since my father passed away) and is just continuing her codependent behavior with me.

this might seem a silly question if i read it myself, but when you’re in the situation sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees.

is the only way for me to reduce her shadowing and codependent behavior (toward me anyway) by removing myself physically from her presence?

i want to ask for some companion care help to start coming by, with the idea that a) it’s another person and b) they might take her on outings to meet even more people.  but i have the feeling that while she still has me to concentrate on, she won’t give other people a chance.  she also already dismissed adult day care centers as “babysitting”.

i want to stay home and get things done.  but should i be looking into moving out instead?  it seems so drastic, but…?

TIA.  bless you all for hanging in there.","Your mom probably feels safe around you. Dementia is very confusing and it must be so difficult to live with it, constant uncertainty, the paranoia, everything changes around you and you have no Control about it. Also, it’s a disease that gets continually worse, so removing yourself from her will not help her, she cannot adapt to this Situation or learn new skills.

So you need to make sure she feels safe, that means a strict routine, daily activities to keep her busy, companionship. 

I think it’s a very good idea to get assistance because caring for dementia patients can be very draining. 

I wish you all the best!
I know it seems drastic but it may be the only way you can live a halfway normal life.  Both my father and my MIL would happily absorb as much of my life that I didn't actively and aggressively defend.",2022-02-22 07:13:32,gromit5,sym6no
Dementia,Advice and Strategies to help resettle loved one short-term (6-8 weeks),"As in the title, looking for some tips to help re-settle my dad for a short term stay somewhere else. As in my post history, I am pregnant but it's looking increasingly likely that the birth will be a C-section. This, on top of several other factors, has me 100% convinced that I can't have my dad here for 6-8 weeks after the birth while baby and I recover. I won't be able to provide the care that he needs, and it isn't feasible to have strangers in and out of my home helping with him during that vulnerable time.  


So he will be resettled somewhere temporarily for 6-8 weeks.  


Has anyone had to relocate their loved one for a short term stay? I'd really appreciate tips and hints and help on how I break the news to him and then how to make the transition as stress-free as possible. I know it'll involve meltdowns, but I'm hoping they're only minor and subside after a few days. He's pretty hung up on the idea of getting some steroids to try and help his ""auto-immune disease"" (because he's back to being in denial about it being dementia) but his GP thankfully will not prescribe them, and I've been very firm that he won't be doing illegal drugs in my house so maybe that's an angle I could suggest? Unsure.  


Thanks in advance x","Yes, I've used respite care for 30 days and then again for 60+ days. My advice is to have minimal discussion about it and if possible, to use an excuse that he can't refute. For instance, I would not say it's because you won't have the time or energy to give him care because he may just insist he can take care of himself and it will turn into a back and forth conversation/argument.  Maybe you will need his bedroom for a couple weeks for a nurse and then it gets extended... Put blame on others whenever possible: ""The doctor said I'll need a nurse for 2 weeks and made me schedule it through her office."" ""The nursing agency requires.... or doesn't allow..."" etc. Also, I would wait until shortly before he's going to go to the new place to mention it to him. And stress that it's only temporary.

(I don't understand your idea about the steroids?)

P.S. Expect angry phone calls demanding that you come get him, or saying that he is leaving or walking home, etc. Be prepared to block his calls with the caregiver knowing how to reach you in an emergency.",2022-02-21 22:15:20,ParentalAnalysis,sycuqn

Dementia,Update on Mom and questions,"Last year my father died unexpectedly (May 2021) and we put Mom in memory care. It was a little difficult at first and she had a severe UTI but recovered but lost her mobility. She forgot who I was so I did not speak to her for a few months but would talk to the staff to keep informed about how she was doing. Then she was put in the care of a wonderful nurse practitioner who worked with dementia patients. She changed Mom’s medications and it was like the sun peaking through the clouds.  Bits and pieces of my mom would shine through the haze of her forgotten memories. We began to talk frequently on the phone and I was able to visit once between multiple lockdowns due to covid cases in the facility. FYI, all staff and residents are fully vaccinated and staff are tested twice a week. About a month ago Mom tested positive for covid but had no symptoms or discomfort. There was one more suspected UTI but the trip to the ER confirmed no UIT but her bladder was very full and the doctor speculated this may be a very early sign of end of life. She now has an external catheter and the staff say she seems happy and is eating. She does sleep quite a bit. But the biggest change is she cannot say many words before lapsing into gibberish. She will say I love you, and sometimes respond with “I love you more…” which she knows is funny. But she calls all of the male staff Russ or Jeff (my dad and brother) and the female staff by my name or Mom. Conversations are short because I think she gets frustrated not being able to converse.

Question for all the caregivers, family and professional:
She has had Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia for 4-5 years at least. What stage would you say she is at, and how much time do you think she has? I love her so much and hate to see her like this, and I know what the end is like. I need to sit down with my brother and start preparing him for the loss of our mother. Thank you all and blessings to each of you for all your care and understanding.","It's hard to say when ""it's time."" Even my grandma's hospice team tell me it's difficult to tell since there are so many variables. In terms of what stage, again, difficult to say, but I would say at least mid-stages.

Right now my grandmother is in late-stages and sleeps a lot--20+ hours a day, and doesn't eat much. She went a week without eating or drinking recently, and is now eating maybe 1-2 tablespoons of food each day.

My dad and I have been ready for this for many years as her symptoms onset about 10 years ago. Just take your time. There is no rush to do anything. It's okay to start mourning now...I've been mourning the loss of my grandmother for the past 2 years, and I will mourn her loss when she passes. If her wishes were to have a funeral/memorial, you can start planning now so that you're not overwhelmed later on. Beyond that, I wouldn't worry.
I'm not really sure about your question, but your story here makes me feel better about how I'm handling my mom in memory care.  It took her about 8 months before she settled in - she would call me several times a week and yell at me for ""putting her there"" (a hospital ER visit did, not me) and to tell me what a terrible daughter I was.  I did visit her a couple of times - the latest visit being in September, and she was finally off that train after about 8 months, however she thinks she is still living in her old apartment building.  I keep tabs on her through the staff because I'm afraid if I visit, it will disrupt her routine, and throw her into being angry again.  The last time I spoke with the social worker there, she said that she thinks that my mom thinks my brother & I are still young children.  To be honest, we never really had that mother/daughter bond, but it still makes me feel guilty.
I’m a clinical nurse supervisor who works with many memory care residents. Unfortunately there is no good timeline. 

It’s very frustrating and hard, but just cherish all the time you can. I’ve had residents stay in the stage your mom seems to be in for 1-2 years and I’ve had some pass in less than 3 months. Each person is so different and you never really know. I would recommend getting a hospice consultation as they are a great resource.",2022-02-21 15:25:01,AbFab_Fab,sy3fl4
Dementia,Diagnosis and Treatment,"Good afternoon.  From the observable behavior of my mother (85), when compared to the DSM4 TR details of this disease my mother exhibits several patterns of behavior consistent with this diagnosis.  Below is a snapshot of these behaviours:

1.  Irrational thoughts or ideas.  Some paranoia that do not coincide with rational explanations. 
2.  Hallucinations and other manifestations of voices.  She has said she speaks with her dead relatives and that she has conversations with Jesus.  
3.  Delirium or confusion of basic ideas or thoughts.  Conversations have become very tenuous and have to surround things she understands.  
4.  Outbursts and tantrums.  When excited she will have a positive/negative outburst.  If denied what she wants she will verbally abuse you until she gets her way, may stomp her feet, or have a full melt down until she passes out.  
5.  Emotional instability.  She can wake up in a good mood or just begin crying over a simple problem.  
6.   Irregular sleep pattern.
7.  Wandering outside during irregular hours.  

With this very basic description, am I in the right direction that this is a qualifying behaviour?  Second, how do I go about getting her formally diagnosed to confirm?  My father is her enabler and protector, thus he will cater and support this behavior no matter the cost.   

Ultimately I really want my mother to be safe but it feels as though her behavior is getting more and more out of control.   Having her wandering around at 3am outside in 20 degree weather is not safe for her.   

Any feedback would be welcomed.  Thanks.","Sounds like you need to have her PCP look at her ASAP. You may have to make up excuses (required by insurer, general checkup, a worrying spot on the back of her neck that nobody but you happens to be able to see.) Call ahead to the doc office, let them know what it's really about. 

The clincher for me is 3 a.m. strolls in 20°, as well as stuff that sounds like danger to self or others. Although—I know plenty of folks who talk to Jesus, and I myself have talked to people on the Other Side. 

Could be dementia. Could also be UTI or other bio issues. Could be meds interaction. But it needs to be attended to.

Dementia,58 yo husband showing a significant decline MCI - but is he a faker?,"There is no easy way to tell this story. I have been married to the same man for a little over 30 years. It hasn't been a bad marriage but it has always been a very needy one, on his part. My husband's mother was also an emotionally needy person. I didn't see this quality in my husband until I was well into the thick of our marriage. We've had a good life together, but his neediness has been exhausting over the years. Add to this he is not exactly a ""go-getter."" I think his mother's self-focus left him feeling alone in childhood & he essentially never grew up. Step in me pragmatic Mary Poppins. Take care of everything. Make things better for everyone. I'm not as nice as Mary Poppins though and as I get older I'm bitter.

The reason I say all this is because I'm now dealing with a situation I can't handle. My husband, I'll call him Winston, was diagnosed about 7 years ago with serious dementia and was told he needs to get his affairs in order soon. It was devastating news, of course. But the catch is, it was not provided by a reliable neurologist. We later found out that he was somewhat of a licensed practicing quack.  (a story for another time). Long story short his diagnosis was rebuffed by many other trusted doctors and neurologists who confirmed over and over that my Winston was not in cognitive decline and in fact, he was a relatively healthy man for his age and situation. 

So, good news, you'd think, right? Well not for Winston, he couldn't shake out that original diagnosis and settled himself into a funk and self-pity. He almost immediately start focusing on everyday absent-mindedness or slow recall to sure signs that he was in the mental decline the quack doctor said he was.  I was left to manage everything in our married life. Income, finances, children, medical and mental care for our family and extended family. Winston, in the meantime, became a couch potato, making his incorrect diagnosis a self-fulling prophecy. 

However, there is more to this story. Winston did not like to work. He never did. He did not want any responsibility in life. He was the jovial life of the party. Everyone loved Winston, he was good for laughing and up for anything fun. This is part of what attracted me to him when I was young. I came from a stoic hard-working family with very little time for fun or affection, and Winston showed me a world I never knew existed. He was a way out of my tough demanding family that displayed little support and caring for each other.  It was fun for a long time until it came time to really be an adult. Winston could not do it. He drifted from job to job. Winston often got promoted quickly because he was so charming and witty management loved him, but in a short time, they realized that was all he was and he end up getting fired, over and over. I kept us afloat all those years. I was a good worker, just as I was raised to be. I paid the bills and got us through rough times. I found Winston job after job that he'd eventually lose. I took care of the house, the repairs, the care of the children all the adult work.  I had to threaten Winston I'd leave him just to get him to mow the yard and take out the trash on a regular basis.

I always knew when Winston's current job wasn't going well because suddenly he'd be ill. He'd start calling in sick over nothing. That was usually the beginning of the end for every job. If I was ever sick, he was sicker, no matter if it was a simple headache or pneumonia. He was sicker because not to be would mean he would be in charge and have to manage things until I got better. 

So now Winston seems to have MCI and I don't know if he really does. After years of this, I think he's just trying to get out of holding down a job, helping me around the house. His job is not difficult and it provides a reasonable income and needed health insurance. He managed to keep this job for 7 years since his false diagnosis. 

I don't know what to do, and sadly I don't want to take care of him. He's drained the life out of me. I'm older now and not in great health. I'd like to take care of myself instead of him. Our kids are grown adults, and they seldom connect with us. I understand why, we have a sad home now, with little hope of a good outcome. I dream of just leaving Winston and starting a new life somewhere far away from all of this, but I know the burden of his care will fall on the children. Why should they have to deal with Winston when it was my choice to marry him all those years ago?

I don't know if he has MCI or not, but he knows I'm fed up. My compassion is running out and I'm not sure if he deserves the compassion I've given him. He does seem to be getting worse, at least when he's around me. He can't seem to manage the simplest tasks I ask him to do from holding up a curtain rod for two seconds to shoveling a short sidewalk. 

I'm lost and I don't know what my next step should be, but this can't go on. I've alluded to some of the problems with Winston to my close family and friends, but not wanting to burden them and be the ""Debbie Downer,"" I keep most of these feelings to myself. 

If you've read this far, thanks. I don't know what I expect in terms of help or support, but I'm not able to go to support groups without Winston. I work full time and in my free time, Winston is there and behaves in a way that makes me feel like I can't leave him alone.","[deleted]
This sounds like such a shitty situation.  Sorry you’re having to deal with it.  You deserve better.  

My dad dealt with something similar and he chose to stay until the bitter end.  Sadly he got cancer and passed away while still married. I regret he wasn’t able to have some time with better quality of life (ie without Mom) before he died. 

I am grateful for Dad having borne the burden for so long. But also it turned out that having to step up and manage mom’s business affairs and severe mental health problems has led to some good outcomes.  I had to become stronger and more capable to be effective with Mom and to protect myself and my family of creation. I took mom for a Neuropsych evaluation and confirmed it was largely mental illness and not dementia.  Mom finally had to go for inpatient mental health treatment and get her meds adjusted to something workable. 

Your kids are adults so they can make their own choices about how much to help out their dad.  It could be that they end up cutting him off, or maybe one decides to keep helping him.  

As for you, I would like to recommend getting a therapist to help work through all of this.  Perhaps you can take a “vacation” by living elsewhere (nearby) for a little while, and see if that helps you get some clarity and perspective. Who knows, it might help shock your husband into realizing you can’t go through life being exclusively a burden and then expect your loved ones to just suck it up forever.
Oof, this is such a tough situation, and I'm sorry you have to deal with all this. 

Please bear in mind, of course, that I don't know you, I'm in no way a qualified professional, and this is just my opinion, but I think you should not take care of Winston, both for your own sake and for his. The ""for your sake"" part is obvious, but the other part is that you are going to find it incredibly difficult to take *good* care of him when you are also actively resenting him (for good reason - this isn't a diss on you!). You won't *intend* to do a bad job, but caregiver burnout is a problem even in the best of circumstances. And in these circumstances, you don't even *want* to do this, so you're going to get aggravated or get burned out more quickly - or you may just stop caring, which won't be good for him. He will get better care from professionals - and he will also likely respond better to professionals as well. He's used to ignoring you, clearly, so you will have one hell of a time trying to, for example, get him to take his medication, let alone get him to see a doctor. These things will be medically necessary, so having professionals deal with him is going to be better for his actual health.   

Here's what I'd suggest, but I don't know if it works with your family dynamic. You say the kids don't stay in touch much, but it doesn't sound like there's bad blood there, just distance. I would talk to the kids about this. Find a way to do it where Winston can't hear you (or read what you're writing, if you do it over email or text). And then tell the kids a modified version of what you've told us here, focusing specifically on the fact that you do *not* want this to fall on them, but you are not willing to sacrifice more of your life for a man who doesn't seem to value you. I'd maybe write some of this out beforehand or practice with a friend or something, because what you *don't* want is for this to become a vent session about all the shit Winston has pulled on you over the years. You'll really want to stay focused, you don't want to tear him down but you do want to deal with the reality that you are already at your breaking point and it's only going to get worse. 

Go into the conversation already having made your decision. Do not let the kids guilt you into staying on to take care of him. Again: That is bad for both you *and* him. (Honestly I'm guessing your kids may share some of your frustrations with their father, assuming he's always been like this, and will likely understand where you're coming from.) Give them concrete examples of his problematic behavior. Do your best to do this without value judgment (you won't be able to do that 100%, but making the effort here is what matters, because it will absolutely help your kids hear you).  

If one of the kids wants to take this on (which seems unlikely), encourage them to do research on what it will take. Tell them to look at forums like this one or caregiver support groups, so they know what they're getting into. Give them a specific limited time for this to happen, and say you'll revisit this in a month or so. 

If the kids all agree they don't want this to be their problem either, great, you're all on the same page, so you start making concrete plans and talking about possibilities. If you cannot get a power of attorney over your husband (it sounds like he's well enough to be considered of sound mind enough for a court), you won't be able to make him do anything, so it may be that you have to leave him and move out of the house, at least for now. Honestly, I'd put it to him this way: Either you are so debilitated by this that you need to give me POA, or you are capable of caring for yourself and I can leave. I wouldn't advocate this in most cases, but most cases don't involve a husband who's also probably been faking it for a while. If you genuinely think he's going to harm himself, call Adult Protective Services. If his insurance allows it, 

It sounds like you have focused on his needs and taken care of him for most of your married life. You have put more than enough energy and work into him, and he's never reciprocated. **You have a right to take care of yourself and focus on your own needs. And you have that right regardless of what is going on with him.** 

Good luck. Please update us with what you decide to do (or post more questions, that's cool too!).
At this point, it doesn't really matter whether he's faking it or not, or whether or not it is his fault or something he is allowing to happen, or willing into existence. A healthy brain doesn't stay healthy without stimulation which he doesn't seem interested in regardless.   *Your* years of good health and years on this planet are finite.

Married women have shorter life expectancies than unmarried women. It is the reverse for men. 40% of family caregivers to Alzheimer's' patients DIE BEFORE THE PATIENT OF STRESS-RELATED CAUSES.

Are you going to let him steal years from your life, both NOW and on the back end?

You're going to copy all of the documentation that says there's nothing wrong with him. You're going to quietly visit an attorney. And, you're going to divorce him.

Life's too short.
I don't know whether he's faking or not.  But YOU aren't faking it.  Why not get some counseling for yourself?  Talk to a professional about how you're feeling and how you're coping with all of this.  Your mental health and wellbeing are equally as important as your husband's and you need to take care of yourself.  They might have some excellent information on how to navigate here.  Wish you well.
I don't know you, but I want to give you a hug and gentle pat pat pats on your back. From me to just you.
OP, this really sounds like he has some kind of cognitive decline. I understand that the “quack Dr.” diagnosis conflicts with the current medical opinion, but I would continue to seek the attention of specialists in neurodegeneration. The path to diagnosis is often rocky. My father went years without a diagnosis (EOAD) and my mom thought he was faking until he had to give up his car and freedom. The possible downside of gaslighting your husbands very real, degenerative illness it not worth the time you save by not continuing to seek out a good specialist who can get a correct diagnosis.",2022-02-21 13:20:52,JCuriousH,sy0ff9
Dementia,Longevity?,"I know that there is really no answer here, but would still like to get some thoughts.  My 86 yo dad lives with my sister and her husband and MIL.  We are reaching a point where that will need to change and have started investigating memory care facilities.  My dad has a beloved elderly dog and any placement would have to allow him to keep his dog.  We’ve found several but they are very top end and, therefore, expensive.  Dad doesn’t have a ton of money but has about $400,000 from sale of his house.  Plus he gets about $2400 monthly in social security.  The place we liked the best will cost around $11,000/month and that will likely increase as his care needs increase.

So, what we are trying to evaluate is how long likely he is to live, as his resources will allow him about 3.5-4 years (we are figuring that us kids will contribute about $1000-1500 per month).  Dad is 86 and probably at about stage 5, but with some signs of decline beyond that.  Other than the Alzheimer’s, he is quite healthy:  no real heart disease, ok blood pressure, eats like a teenage boy, able to walk a couple of miles (with company)…

I know no one can predict, but what are some thoughts about the likelihood of him lasting 4 more years.  (Of course, if he has run out of money by that time, most likely he will be pretty bedridden and out of it and he won’t have the dog, so we could probably move him somewhere where he would be covered by medicaid, right?).","As you said, no one can predict but... based on my own experience with a stage 5 elderly man with great longevity genes, I think your chances are good that his money may see him through the end of his life. The move itself may hasten the dementia. However, I might look at another option besides planning to move him to a Medicaid facility at the end of 4 years: once the dog as passed, and depending on how Dad is doing and what you think of this top end place, you might move him to another very nice facility that agrees to accept Medicaid only after a certain period of time of private pay (such as 1-2 years). This  would relieve some stress about the future and would also insure that he is in the best facility possible should he outlive his money. You might not be at all happy with your choice of Medicaid facilities in So Cal regardless how how aware he is. $200,000 of private pay before Medicaid kicks in could make a big difference.
Look into facilities that may allow him to switch to an elderly waiver or Medicaid waiver(each state is different). My facility requires 1 year of private pay and then they can switch to the elderly waiver whenever they are out of money. 

The harder part may be finding somewhere that accepts the dog to live there full time. Most facilities around here don’t let animals live there unless the resident is able to care for them. If they are service animals that’s a different story of course.
The dog is definitely the challenge, especially since he is a 75 lb golden retriever. The two places we’ve toured will allow, although of course there is an extra fee for that. I appreciate the suggestions about looking at facilities that allow us to convert to Medicaid potentially down the road. We’ll mention that to the advisor who is helping us. We plan to have an updated exam by his neurologist to get a more informed diagnosis of his current stage. He has not seen a neurologist in a while, at least not in person.
This is a fair and necessary question. You're trying to conserve resources. I'd ask his doctor for a best-guess ballpark idea of life expectancy taking into account age, dementia, and other medical issues. Doctors are asked this regularly and should not evade the question.
Can you keep him at home and hire home health aides to come in?  That would sure cost less than 11K",2022-02-21 12:34:37,KeekyPep,sxz9ip

But basically we called the cops when a situation got out of control and told them they needed a mental evaluation.

Don’t know where you are with your situation, but remember you can’t pause your life for very long. Start making strong pushes to resume your life and get your LO the real help they need.
There will always be a nursing facility willing to take them if the bill is getting paid. The facility might put them on a heavy duty dose of meds but sometimes that’s the only thing that works for these awful diseases.
What medications is that person taking?
Dad was aggressive and manic. He’s been on a tiny dose .5 mg risperidone and depakote 125mg in the am and 250 mg in pm. Lowers dopamine levels. We are however it seems advancing into stage 6 with a 3 of 30 mmse",2022-02-21 12:25:40,carolinabluebird,sxz1nh

As a registered nurse at work with dementia patients for which they are like angels and other ones were they are very difficult cases. The best case is to reach out to her primary care provider and if she’s receiving any on-site nursing such as visiting nursing or hospice to reach out to the team.

If she’s not in a terminal situation then bloodwork may be appropriate to reveal what may be causing some of the symptoms. When somebody is terminal and typically blood work doesn’t give a lot of information.

Im not sure if anyone has mentioned it but she might have a UTI
I work in memory care and most common cause is UTI like some people have mentioned. If it’s not a uti it could be dehydration.

Dementia,Grandad with Dementia,"My grandad has had Parkinson’s for as long as I can remember- it’s not genetic it was caused by chemicals from where he worked when he was younger.

The past year or so we have noticed a decline with him, it started off small, forgetting names sometimes and falling, but now we’ve hit a breaking point.

He was recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s Dementia (edit: changed from LBD after checking with my grandma on which one he was diagnosed with) in December 2021, but he was still able to do most things for himself, he could still cook and use the bathroom, have relatively okay conversations, he could still go out by himself and walk with the aid of a walking stick.

Since maybe mid Jan his decline has been slightly more rapid, with the biggest thing being incontinence. Since his diagnosis, I try to go to their house every night to help out, and spend most weekends with them, but I worry it’s not enough anymore.

In the past week, my grandad has gone from the man I knew, to what I can only describe as a shell of a man. He has declined so rapidly. He can’t dress or feed himself, he can’t speak (he mumbles but the words don’t make sense), he’s obsessed with winning money and Neil Diamond. 

I’m worried this decline has been brought on by something more than his dementia, but trying to get a GP appointment for him is difficult, whenever we call they tell us “there is nothing they can do” and tell us to “call the police and ambulance if we’re so concerned”.

I suppose this is more just getting it off my chest, but I feel the weight of the world on me right now. I work full time and spend all my free time helping my grandma because there is no other family to do it (my dad helps around work, but works long hours. My sister has no interest in helping, my aunt lives in Wales a few hundred miles away, she doesn’t work but won’t come help unless my grandparents pay for her to come help). This is so new to me, and this decline has come out of nowhere. I love my grandparents so much, and having to see my grandma cry in the bathroom, or my grandad not know who I am, breaks my heart.

My grandma is at a loss on how to handle this, what to do, where we go from here. We have got in touch with so many different people for help and now it’s just a waiting game. We’re looking in to carers but I feel if this decline is his new normal then a home would be a better solution for everyone, him included.

Please, if anyone can give any advice on how my grandma (his main care giver) or myself can navigate this, I welcome it. Any books, resources etc would be so appreciated.","With such a quick decline, you should see if he has a urinary tract infection.

Dementia,He thinks I'm his daughter.,"I fear my grandpa is slowly starting to think I'm his daughter and I have no one to tell this. 

He has no daughters, never had. There was never a child lost, no miscarriages. He has a few sons who all have sons other than my father. No girl grew up in his household, until I came along, first girl he raised. He retired few weeks before my birth. I am the first (and only) child he was there for everything.

Last summer he started referring to my uncles as my brothers. Each time he corrected himself. ""Your brother, I mean your uncle..."" It's fine, brother is a broad term in his language, elderly people use it for everyone. 

These slips started increasing, last month he called my older cousin ""your nephew"". Didn't realize for some time. Whenever I'm in the country I stay with them to take the load off my grandma. Whole month, he referred to her as ""your mother"".  

He doesn't talk much. He loves them and sits with them. But God knows why, he is so chatty with me. He always talked to me more, but now he is taking notes of things to tell me. He sits next to me and talks to me, no matter where we are. That's why others don't realise, and won't believe me. Some of them hadn't even believed me when I said ""this isn't just getting older, it's dementia"".

I don't know what to do with this, I'm scared to know what it means. I just needed to get this off my chest.","I hear ya.  My mother keeps asking how many kids we have together.
They seem to go backwards through life during dementia. He seems to be very comfortable with you so likes to chat to you. I think you are right. It does look like dementia. Everyone in time will see it too. He probably ought to see an elderly care doctor though
This happened with my great-aunt as she got older and began losing her eyesight. Her main memories of me were as a little kid (we moved cross country when I was 11) but her memories of my mother carried through into mom-as-an-adult, so when I would visit her, she pretty much thought I was my mom. I always just figured that my voice cued a memory of my mom at my age, when everybody was young, and my great-aunt was happy to be in the place of her favorite memories for a while... plus, I got all the dirt on my grandmother. All good, really.
I'm completely serious here, but it may come off as a smart-allecky answer... he may think you're one of his sons. A lady I was in a dementia support group with was constantly being mistaken by her husband for one of his fellow cricket players. Complete with locker room talk. She went with it because reorienting him was more upsetting for him than being mistaken for someone else was for her.

&#x200B;

Just go with it, enjoy the time you have with him. You're a good kid for coming to help take the load off your grandma, there are very few out there who are willing to do that sort of thing.
It could be similar to what I’m starting to experience.  My grandmother has progressed to the point that she can’t accept my sister and I aster her grandkids.

My sister?  She’s now my father’s ex-wife.

Me?  When she doesn’t think I’m my father (she never thinks my sister is my ex, though) she knows I’m family.  She thinks of me as a son.  But… she doesn’t know where I came from.  Adopted?  Married into the family?  She doesn’t worry on how often, but she knows I’m family somehow and defaults to one of her kids.
I think just play along with it. Denying these kind of things usually makes them more agitated. My grandma would often confuse me for being my mom (we do look similar), and wouldn't recognize my mom at all at times.",2022-02-21 04:44:34,reallynotsohappy,sxpppg
Dementia,Bio-mom with Dementia,"I'm going to do you all a favor and preface this by saying this is gonna be long. Like, really freaking long. I'll try to keep the cursing to a minimum, but I am me and I curse a crap tin in real life.


ALSO: Mods, if this rant/question/seeking support isn't applicable for the subreddit, please remove or whatever.


As the title states, my bio mother has dementia. Whelp, she also has Parkinson's, alzheimer's, high BP, diabetes, and a slew of other health concerns/conditions. My brother and I (we're really the only ones to care for her, or that she can actively depend on) have been battling her for the better part of three, maybe four years, when she was diagnosed with early onset. This last year has seen a decline in her health, mental stability, inclination to take the necessary medication, clean her apartment, the list goes on. My guess is we're watch the last year of her life. The downward spiral for the last six months has been extremely dramatic. She fights damn near everything. Not physically, yet, but that time is drawing near. And, before any of you ask, she has qualified for caregivers, but only 20hrs a month, lest she, or someone else pay for more assistance. That's not gonna happen. Brother doesn't have that kind of income and I just got layed off. She refuses to pay for it, saying she ""needs"" all her money. Bro and I cannot keep this up. 24/7 care is fast approaching.


The thing I'm struggling the most with is that her and I have never been close (at least not since I was a 16 yo kid) and I still feel obligated to take care of her.. Shit happed, caused a divide, and we've never recovered. To actually say I hate the woman wouldn't be too far off the mark. And I still stop by and care for her five days out of the week. Through all the yelling, the arguments, the ""get the fuck out of my house"", the disrespect, all of it. It just drains me. And it isn't fair to her, either. She's quite clearly not herself. I try very hard not to take out my frustrations on her, but I slip up occasionally. It's been our dynamic for damn near two decades. Toxic, I am well aware. Part of the reason why, after becoming an adult, I never visited unless it was a family gathering. Neither of us are good for each other on normal conditions. Less so when she is becoming a worse human due to diseases wrecking her grey matter. I feel shitty and guilty all the damn time because of how I feel towards the woman, and I'm just saturated by all the bs she puts my little brother and I through. I know it's not going to get better. I know it's going to get worse. The brother and I tell that to each other now, almost as some kind of screwed up mantra. She wasn't a kind person to us before all of this, and it's become worse, as many of you on here have experienced. But we do for her what we can because we still care. At the end of the day, she gave birth to me. Physically raised me to be a healthy kid. Didn't do much mentally, but hey.... 


The culmination of all of this is that we reached a breaking point this last week. Bio mom went off on me for whatever reason, I had a REALLY shitty day, and I lost my cool on her. I stormed out of her apartment to the sound of her, yet again, yelling at me to ""never come by again"". I have come to my limit, and I don't know how to walk away. How to tell the family that I just can't anymore. They'll shun me, but that isn't an issue. My issue is that she'll be lacking the extra couple of hour a day that I could have been there for her. That now it'll all fall upon my brother again, minus the ONE HOUR she has a caregiver around, if she doesn't fire that person like she did the two before that a year ago. I just don't know anymore.


Sorry for the poor grammar and punctuation. My thoughts are literally everywhere this week. There's a lot going on.","Hey there

I'm sorry. We've all been there and it's awful. 

Dementia is a no-win battle. All you can do is choose which way you will lose. Do you choose the guilt of not helping? The exhaustion, financial price and lost opportunities of care giving? The damage to family relationships based on whatever decision you make or don't make?

&#x200B;

There is literally no way to win. So you make the best decisions you can, and you live with the terrible consequences. Dementia has many victims, including the family of the dementia patient.
Take a break. It's ok. Caregiving is so crazy hard and so stressful for everyone, and if you're not starting from a good point to begin with, it's 1000x harder. 

Give yourself a week or two. Talk to your brother about why you need one. As for the rest of the family - what are they doing to help? Let them come by and deal with her for a while. Tell them you need a break and would appreciate their help for a few days... and if they bail, well, then they're not going to shun you for doing the same thing. And if they do help out, they'll get why you couldn't handle it. 

And then after a week or two, when you've had a chance to calm down, think through what makes the most sense for your sanity and her care. Not sure where in the world you are, but if it's the US, there's usually a local dept on aging that will help you find care for her and can recommend steps towards getting her into a home. That sounds like the next best step for everyone. 

Good luck and all the best.
The very first thing you need to do is get the family to an Elder Attorney.  You need to get legal papers sorted so someone has a financial POA in place so extra care can be paid out of her funds.  Second..........this disease is madness, take a break and then try going back slowly.  You can only do your best, you have to save some sanity for yourself. You have to get the rest of the family involved, perhaps get them to agree to some kind of schedule that won't put the majority of the care on any one or two people.  Good luck.
Your writing/formation of your thoughts are superb. Good job!

Taking a break is a must. Focus on GF and her family for a week. See how you fell about bio mom after that. 

Lets talk about something else for a while. Like: wow! the temps are going to be very very low the next few mornings!! Like: are your daffodils and other bulbs coming up? Like: do you have a pet and if so, what is it like? That kinda stuff...

His short term memory maybe in the last 6 months had been declining, then my aunt passed away from liver disease at 67. My grandfather since then has been declining in his memory, ability to eat, and ability to hold his bodily functions.

He refused to wear the depends underwear provided. I’m so sorry this is happening. And, most recently, my grandfather woke up yesterday and ended up soiling his clothes. While attempting to put the clothes in the dryer instead of the washer, he ended up falling on his stomach with nothing on. My mom is witnessing all of this, trying to help him up, trying to tell him that he put the clothes in dryer instead of the washer. She called me crying her eyes out about all of this while my uncle tried to call me to ask me if o could help. My family is against putting him in a senior assisted living facility but I feel that may need to be the case. I told my my mom to call 911 if he fell, but she had excuses for not calling (they’ll put him back in bed and he’ll stay there all day again, there’s a few that may be incurred). I provided with her with local aging resources but there’s this resistance to seeking outside help. I provided her with local caregiver in-home care resources, and nothing.I have a cousin who is coming out to live in the house and take care of him but they don’t know her qualifications, she’s been wanting to move back anyway. They informed her of the situation and she’s okay to take care of my grandfather, my family’s plan was to give her money to take care of him. She doesn’t have a job, she has major health issues, and she keeps asking for money from people to help with moving expenses —my moms partner gave her $3000 and there’s a go fund me to help her move for $2000. I’m not sure why I’m posting I’m just angered by the situation, the discomfort with seeking professional help outside the family, and letting my cousin move in rent free to a house in a major Southern California City. Again, I’m not sure what I’m looking for. I think my grandfather needs to be evaluated for dementia but also depression too. I’m trying to stay out of it now because my mom and uncle need to decide what’s best but I’m sad, frustrated, shocked how fast his decline is. All I want is for him to receive the proper care from a professional. My family admits they can’t do this, they’re willing to let my cousin try but he needs to be evaluated by doctor, possibly anti-depressants, and provided with things like sunlight, socialization, and stimulation besides the TV. My friend recommended my family force my cousin to go through a certification course I’m caretaking before moving in but that’s not being considered. I feel like at this point, I need to step away and put my boundaries up with the situation and that it’s not my fight. :/","I feel for you. Dad died of Alzheimer's and I'm seeing hints of it in myself. As someone headed in your loved ones direction I can say that I would rather be eventually put in a retirement home to lessen the burden on my children.  Even so, I pray that then comes quickly when it's time.
How close are you and yours cousin? With my grandma’s dementia and her caretaker, my aunts, hoarding, my cousin is the only family member I have to talk to. 

If she’s planning on being a caretaker she NEEDS training. She will go under in a heartbeat if she also has mental health issues.
Oh, so sorry, that's very hard.  Often there is a sudden significant decline, particularly after a bereavement, accident, operation.  I feel for you, it's a sad shock to see yr grandpa decline swiftly.  

 Yeh, if nobody is listening to your input, it's like banging your head against a wall.   Certainly does not sound like a situation that an inexperienced amateur with major health problems can take care of, at all.  Sounds like absolutely, he ought to be in a care facility.   Idk about your country, but here in Aust, that would be bordering on 'elder neglect' or even 'elder abuse' sort of territory, quite serious.   I understand many people don't want to 'put relative in a home', but yr mom & uncle, I agree with you, are not doing the right thing.    Also, sometimes, it does take a crisis to get this to happen.  Such as - a fall, & ambulance need to come take him to hosptial, where he'll then get an evaluation & maybe a push to oldies facility.  

What's going on now, sounds like at best, grandpa will end up in a facility (I hope) and your cousin will get a free home.   Have you contacted your area dementia .org or alzheimers .org?  They are experienced experts, have tons of resources, info, counselling, telephone help-lines, etc etc.  Info/counselling for you, and yr mom  uncle.   Best of luck!
I am so sorry this is happening - contact the local agency on aging where your grandfather is and maybe have them put you in touch with Adult Protective Services.  I totally get it - there comes a point where they need professional help - help that we as non-medical providers cannot provide.
It's a little worrying about your cousin coming in.  I hope her heart's in it.

It's too much for any one person really.  Since the decision making seems to be out of your hands I'd just try to advocate for your Grandfather.  You could volunteer to take him to an appointment, or just visit, call, facetime as often as you can.  I'm sorry, take care.",2022-02-21 02:17:03,Classic_Willow,sxngxf
Dementia,What should I do?,My great grandmother always asked where my grandfather is. I don't know what to say. Please help me.,"Do a web search on Therapeutic Fibbing.  Anything you read will explain it so much better than I would. Most important thing is to not cause more stress or agitation with your answer. 
The first time fibbing doesn't feel quite right, but when they react more calmly than they would to the truth, you'll see the value.",2022-02-20 23:18:39,random_person007,sxkcq9
Dementia,Advice Appreciated.,"Hi all, I'm (20M) new to this sub (literally just joined) and could use advice about my Grandfather, Ash, with dementia that I care for.

To start, my Grandmother abruptly passed last April from aggressive lung cancer. She took care of all of Ash's needs and no one in the family knew the extent of his dementia till after she died. Me needing a place to live, I moved in with him to take care of meals and medication during the evenings and have been here for 8 months. 

This is where I need advice. For the first time last week he started asking about my Grandma: where is she? her car's not here? is she out driving?... I don't know how to approach this yet he has begun asking more frequently. I try to deflect; say idk; and change the subject (usually the about the Olympics rn). 

I'm looking for advice about how I should approach this, maybe just reassurance I'm doing the right thing? I think it unneeded if I bring up her death if he asks, it would only cause grief for the both of us. But otherwise, idk what to say. 

Thanks in advance🙂","I have lived my entire life believing completely in - always tell the truth (or say nothing). Then Mum got dementia and I learned to lie or, as I like to rephrase it - be creative with the truth.  You will learn to divert, to redirect, prevarricate and sadly even downright lie. It is sad but you nailed it you will do anything to avoid the anxiety and sadness that truth will bring. You are doing well so keep doing it.
I agree with your approach. Instead of idk you could try some excuses based on your knowledge of grandmother's past routine. For instance, she's visiting Aunt Lena etc. Once you hit on one he accepts, stick with it and then redirect to a new subject or activity as you have been. Comfort and reassurance is your goal.
It really depends on your grandfather and where his head is at the time. You could try telling the truth. If he starts to get agitated try to redirect to something else. I’ve worked with a client whose husband passed years ago and everyday they ask of his whereabouts. 8/10 I can usually tell them the truth and they will mostly accept it even if they don’t quite understand it. The 2/10 they won’t and you just kinda have to redirect them, or leave them to settle naturally. Sometimes there’s nothing more you can do (remember that) 

Just as a side note as you are taking on a carers role. UTI’s can severely impact a person with dementias mental state, making them worse or (loopy, increasing agitation) so always push fluids.
Turn it back on him.  If he says ""her car's not here, is she out driving?"" say ""You're right, it isn't here, where do you think she went?""  

There's no pint in telling a truth that will only cause pain.  It's not like the fact of her death was hidden from him or that telling him will prevent him from asking again.  Address the emotion behind the words, not the words themselves.",2022-02-20 21:35:39,rictor_ricks_com,sxidxl
Dementia,How to handle harsh accusations?,"I read about Theuropeutic Fibbing from the Alzheimers association and it said using white lies to guide their dementia was more beneficial than going against it. Although this has been quite affective with my nan, she has begun accusing my step brother (a loving and kind man) of stealing her grand daughter away from her because she never sees her anymore and hasn't for ""years"" (which is not at all the case, she saw her months ago before they had a baby prematurely and have been looking after it for 2 months/COVID restrictions kept all the family from seeing them). 

I tried to contest this and it went somewhat well surprisingly. But only an hour later and nothing had changed (I'm not surprised at this, but I felt I had to at least try).

What should we do?","Even if she accepts your response, she will likely have the same complaints again and again because she doesn't remember. If you've found something that works, just repeat it again as if it's the first time and then change the subject. If her granddaughter visited right now, she could go back to saying the same thing again in a few hours. That's the nature of dementia.",2022-02-20 21:33:52,TheSaltiestHam,sxicq8
Dementia,"She called her ""Mom""","My Grandma has been gone over a year now sometimes I still think of the weird things surrounding the last few months and her unexpected death... She lived alone as my Grandpa pasted away a year before her I realize she should not of lived alone and tried to explain this to my mother but I think she was in denial and also I think sometimes my grandma would hide how bad she was... Anyways the last week or so my Mom, her daughter, gave her a notebook so my grandma could write things down to remember she did them... On her death I read this notebook which only had like a page or 2 in it. Two things stood out 1. She said ""Mom"" told me to write in this notebook so I'd remember... ""Mom"" not ""Daughter"" but ""Mom""... I did ask my mom about this and she said sometimes people with dementia will refer to there caregivers as ""Mom"" or ""Dad"" which she actually referred to my brother as ""Dad"" once so her grandson... The 2nd thing is the constant ""Jesus please help me""... I think about her death here and there still because of the mystery surrounding it idk what happened only she was very confused and couldnt figure out her phone to call us for help.... This disease is horrible and its incredibly sad...","It is a horrible disease, my grandmother started to confuse people to that level only after when she was not self-sufficient for a few years. I'm a male and she confuses me for her sister, sometimes for her mother.
I’m so sorry. It is so sad.
My dad has dementia, there was a period of months where he’d call me dad
I have worked in dementia wards a long time and that is sadly very common. We had this little couple who were in their 90s, and they both had dementia. They had ten kids together but she was his mom and he was her dad",2022-02-20 21:28:58,Mamamuffin441,sxi9dl
Dementia,babies,"My mom (80) has recently been diagnosed with dementia. Since her diagnosis, things haven’t been going well and one thing that sticks out is she talks about babies all the time. Prior to 2 or 3 weeks ago, she hadn’t mentioned them at all. Now, every conversation she’ll talk about babies to an extent. I was just curious if this has happened to anyone else and if there’s a reason why? Also she’s been much more aggressive and hit my brother today (I asked what time he got there to see her and she said one time and my brother said he got there later then what she had said and she got very upset). Is that common? Thanks in advance!","Memory care places often have nurseries in them because dementia patients have their long term memories of when they were children and young parents. Talk with your mom about babies. Ask her about her own babies. You may learn some things about your mom. Flow with her own her journey. My dad sometimes sees babies at the end of his bed and he will call me, excitedly, to come see the baby! I always go and ask whose baby is it? One time he said, it’s you, dummy!
Sticking to a theme is pretty common. My mom was always kid crazy so when imagined conservations with kids happened, we kinda just went with it.

Any time someone with dementia gets contradicted it can be a 50/50 shot on them getting angry. It's better not to disagree with them. If something genuinely needs to be cleared up, do it out of their sight. You're never going to convince them they're wrong and it's just going to cause tension.
Interestingly enough, Mom’s memory care had doll babies available for the residents to hold.  Many of the women did just that, they held the dolls and talked to them. It was so sweet how they “took care” of the dolls.
Until we got my mothers meds dialed in she was hitting people with her cane. It was so unlike her. Anyway, at first the meds wiped her out but over a few weeks she bounced back. She’s so much happier now.

Another huge help is her ‘baby’. 

I bought my mom a ‘reborn’ baby doll and she loves it. This baby is her life now; you never see her without the doll (or her handbag)! She is 88 with vascular dementia and pretty far along; wants to know when her mommie is going to visit, thinks he husband who passed 14 years ago is just at the store, etc. 

I was hesitant to give her the doll (she has a strong bullshit meter) and framed it as ‘I’d bought it for the youngest granddaughter but thought the doll was too big, what do you think mom?’ We couldn’t decide so I asked if I could leave it at moms place & the granddaughter could play with it whenever she visited. Granddaughter lives far away and is never brought over to visit but mom decided to keep ‘it’ just in case.

When I visited mom the next day she’d pulled ‘baby’ out of her box and has hardly set her down for the last 3 months. Mom eats, sleeps, plays with baby all day long. I get chided for not holding her correctly or putting her too close to the edge of the chair. Staff has to get someone else to watch baby while mom gets bathed. They’ve  mentioned many times how glad they are that mom has baby.

I never know what will interest mom and have bought tons of ‘dementia’ products and am constantly searching for activities but this doll is the only thing mom is interested enough in to engage with on her own. 

Here is a link to the one I bought. 

https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B095CCGKDR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

She has the cutest face and always seems to be looking at you. She wears 0-3 month baby clothes and we’ve got a few outfits. Best $67 I’ve spent in the last year.
My grandma got to a point where she couldn't focus on any media for more than a couple of seconds and the only thing that she really enjoyed was when we put on YouTube compilations of babies laughing. She loved children and there was no story she had to follow, no characters, it didn't matter if the clips repeated, she just laughed at the cute babies giggling.
Get her a doll baby,  many places use them to help dementia patients.  Get some outfits and baby blankets and a doll aby,  that might help calm her.
They often go back to when their kids are babies and thinking they need to take care of them
My mother was given a baby doll to take care of. Sometimes, she over worries she wasn't feeding it properly. However, there were times she would sing and play with it. And during these times, her face lit up and she is one happy camper. I would suggest you go flow with her and ask her stuff about the baby..",2022-02-20 21:06:29,mangooomadness,sxhta0
Dementia,I just need help. Emotionally overwhelmed.,"I don’t think this sub is appropriate to share my full story, but I am 43/F and have two parents who are physically and mentally ill, and a disabled brother a couple years older than me. My extended family has suspected my mom has been in early stages of dementia for several years now, but she avoids doctors so hasn’t been diagnosed. Even if she does have it, I’m guessing it’s still early stages as any stories I could tell about her aren’t nearly to the degree of severity many of you have shared.

All that being said, I visited my parents and brother after a somewhat long absence yesterday and it’s apparent that their entire living situation is declining and somewhat rapidly. I just need general help talking through their specific situation to prepare myself for what is still to come. Since I believe my mom’s dementia is still rather mild, I feel like I should discuss in more detail on another sub. I tried finding “elderly/elder care” subs but they don’t appear to be active. Are there any other subs you have found helpful? If not subs, what agency could I contact via phone to get some support and advice? I don’t want to tie up Dementia/Alzheimer’s advocates as I know there are others in much greater need than me. TIA for any leads. I am in the Pacific NW, USA if that makes a difference.","Please do not think this an inappropriate place for you to be. If your mom has the beginnings of dementia, even if it’s at the mild cognitive impairment level, then this sub is for you. 

Why don’t you share with us what you’ve seen and what you think your next steps could be? There’s a lot of knowledge here, so I’ll bet we can help you. Also, do not hesitate to use the various Alzheimer’s/dementia advocates. They are there to help all of us, not just those in the advanced stages.

And: wow, you've got a lot on your plate, and a big heart. Blessings and thanks for rolling up your sleeves.

One starting point for IRL contact might be your ""area council on aging""—search online for that phrase, and add a state or county… it may take a few calls to get to the right place. 

You might also contact their health insurance provider. I know, yuck, US healthcare is a shell game, MLM, long con. But it is in their interest to keep your family from catastrophic stuff warranting emergency medical care. I'm finding out that the (politely) squeaking wheel gets the grease—like a case manager who can take an overview.

Best wishes, ❤️
You should look up your local Area Agency on Aging for help. Bring up your concerns about your mom possibly having dementia. I really can't imagine a situation where it's ""too soon"" to get help especially since it sounds like the other people in the household aren't prepared to care for her?
Small help. But can you get and would they accept Meals on Wheels? In my parent's declining years it was a godsend in terms of keeping them fed after cooking and grocery shopping became too hard

Dementia,Um... are those teeth marks?,,"I thought it was mozzarella, which I would totally understand eating like that - until I saw the subredditname. I'm sorry your loved one is doing this to themselves :(
People with dementia often experience something called agnosia. Which is the inability to recognize objects (through sight, sound, taste, etc) It is quite common and extra caution should be taken to keep things that would be unsafe out of their reach. It can be very difficult with everyday objects such as soap, because it's obviously something they would need to use. I suggest finding a creative strategy with assisting with personal care. Just being more mindful of their surroundings and what could potentially cause harm.
Uhm. . . Remember to toilet them FREQUENTLY for the next few hours. Things might get messy.
Yes, I think so….
She is in memory care and I don't think she can get out of bed, so I am really confused. The soap is hard, but was wet from my washing my hands. It wasn't as ""bitey"" looking when it was upside down. I just noticed it when I set it down.

MAYBE they could have left her in her wheelchair in front of the sink to wash her hands?

MAYBE someone else wandered into her room and it was another resident that ate the soap?
They *might* be teethmarks, but it also resembles the sort of erosion you see on a stone that has been under dripping water for years--if it was in the sink 
 and directly under a leaky faucet, for example, that could make it look like that.  

The soap also looks incredibly soft/soggy, and the shape of it around the top of the ""bite"" also looks somewhat hollowed out--those would also happen if the bar has been under dripping water for a while.  

What does the underside look like? From this angle, the ""bite"" out of the bottom looks considerably smaller than the top, and much less like a bitemark than the upper part.  

Unless your loved one has lost their sense of taste entirely, I *doubt* they're taking bites out of soap and actually eating them. It's been known to happen though, but if they have any sense of taste, they might have spit it out somewhere discreet (bathroom trash can, toilet, etc.).  Depends on the person and their background though.
Could be. Tasty.
Mice-rats eat soap, so maybe check for infestation.
take your LO to the doctors Asap. This could be very bad......",2022-02-20 13:43:36,lsharris,sx84a5
Dementia,When the healthy parent is in denial about the one with dementia,"My mom’s memory decline started slowly and has been accelerating more noticeably recently. 

Complications: I live several states away, so I am not able to be present in any daily kind of way. Everyone in the immediate family circle won’t touch it with a ten foot pole (there was one convo with dad in which he said he wants to “wait and see” what happens).  

My siblings and I decided something has to change, so I agreed to press my dad on it (with sensitivity, of course). That will be later today. Ugh.

Through some research I have found articles about addressing dementia with the actual parent who has it, but I can’t seem to find any advice about dealing with the *healthy* parent who is in denial, and how to sensitively tell them they need to get things going. 

Living far away makes me feel pretty powerless, and yet also guilty for not being vocal sooner. Thank for reading.","If they don’t have a diagnosis of dementia yet, it’s possible it’s something else. Delaying a diagnosis could have serious consequences. What if it’s something easily fixed such as a vitamin or hormone deficiency? What if it’s something like a brain tumor that could be operated on now, but would be too late in 6 months? I would try to explain to your dad that NOW is the time to figure out what is the cause and what can be done about it. If he refuses, I would make an appointment for mom, take her “out for lunch” and then take her to the doctor myself. This is how I roll. I don’t have time for people who aren’t strong enough or smart enough to do what needs to be done. Thanks to that, we have a diagnosis for my husband long before his family was willing to admit anything was amiss.
Try not to beat yourself up about this. When I talk to my dad, who wanted to “wait and see”, I point out all the scenarios where his wife showed evidence of decline. No matter what the cause, be firm and calm. Good luck.
I am in a very similar situation with my dad. His girlfriend of 5 years is apprehensive about addressing the driving situation, and his complete inability to maintain a calendar or keep in contact with people. (Not to mention hygiene and diet issues, and even just tracking with an everyday conversation).

I am 2000 miles away, and until recently I had not noticed the severity of the cognitive impairment, but as I've seen recently, my dad definitely is on a fast track to a memory care home.
My first effort will be to get added to the HIPAA form so that I can speak with his new neurologist, and hopefully get a more accurate assessment of dad's condition (he recently got a diagnosis of ""mild cognitive impairment,"" but dad can barely type an email, and he definitely should not be driving).
If there is a concise diagnosis from a physician, it can be easier to convince those we love to make changes that will ease the transition for everyone.
I'm just trying to get ahead of some precipitous event that has very bad consequences :(
In the meantime, I had a heart to heart discussion with my dad about my concerns, and offered some thoughtful suggestions to address them (none of which he remembered later, according to the GF).

It can be so draining to address these things. You are not alone.
No one wants to have to admit to this truth. It sucks. And if your default is ignoring in order to avoid conflict or difficult things then it’s only natural to extend that to situations such as this.

It also feels like sometimes a partner/spouse covers for the other so long and so often they don’t even realize how much.

A very difficult spot for you to be in. :(
I wish I had answers. And a magic wand!
Thanks to everyone who replied—it was good to read your perspectives. I made the call and laid out my concerns and reassured my dad that we (my sibs and I) are concerned and want to help. And that it’s important to get her to a doctor to find out what’s happening and get a diagnosis. 

It was incredibly awkward and a bit tense… it’s clear to me now how in denial he is. He kept saying “she’s fine” and “I’m taking care of her.” I am drained and sad. I debriefed with my brother and sister afterwards, and my brother is going to talk to him next as a follow-up later this week. We’re going to stay on this as a group, which is at least a good step forward. 

Glad I found this sub— thanks for taking the time to chime in. ❤️
My dad refuses to see my mom's mental issues too so I know what you're going through. But at some point it will become undeniable and your dad will have to accept the situation. In the mean time maybe you can get together with likeminded family members and start coming up with a care plan for her when the time comes that she needs outside help. Having a plan ready to go can ease the stress. Having a clear path forward may also help your dad accept that your mom has memory problems. Sometimes denial comes from not knowing what the   next step should be.",2022-02-20 11:18:32,electrickoalapants,sx4s8r
Dementia,Oh boy... The bathroom problem... Should my family start buying diapers for my dad?,"My father was diagnosed with dementia about 6 years ago, and the decline has been rapid. 

Over the past few months, things have gotten much worse... he's losing his balance, pacing around the house nonstop for 10 hours a day, compulsively talking in gibberish... and worst of all, he now has a habit of going to the bathroom whenever and *wherever* he wants. Until recently he was able to communicate that he needed to go, but that's no longer the case.

I've been trying to convince my mom that it's time for onesies and diapers, but she disagrees, apparently wanting to spare him some dignity. 

He DOESN'T soil *himself*, but he soils every square inch of the floor in our home. At this point, she's mopping up after him multiple times a day, and wet-vaccuming the carpet in their room every morning. I wouldn't be surprised if she devotes 10-15 hours a week cleaning up his ""accidents,"" and when *she's* not home, the job falls onto my siblings and I to clean up the mess. At this point, I think it's fair to say that our patience is wearing thin with the situation. 

I tried talking to her about it today, but she's drawing the ""diaper line"" at him defecating in his pants. Until then, she's not interested in going that route. 

I understand that cleaning up someone with a diaper is equally as difficult as mopping floors on a constant basis, but I feel like his current situation is even *less* dignified than wearing one. 

Am I wrong in my logic? Are there other steps or fixes to the situation aside from diapers? 

I moved back in with my parents (as did my siblings) specifically to help with my dad, but we're all hitting a breaking point now due to this.","You are 100% in the right. Your dad is clearly beyond the point of having any comprehension of dignity.  My observation with my mom is she reverted to toddlerhood and sadly eventually like an infant before she passed.

F*ck Dementia.
Hope this helps you in the future but when you do get the diapers,  don't call them diapers. Just call them underwear or whatever you want to besides diapers.  Saw that tip somewhere along the way and it really helped the transition for my mom when we had to remove her underwear drawer and replace them all with pampers. Good luck.  Fuck dimentia
Honestly, IMO, when it gets to that point is when the person needs to be in full-time memory care. This was the line for me when it came to caring for my dad. A family can only do so much, it's time for the professionals.

I know it's a super difficult decision to make. But it's honestly for the best of your dad. And your poor mom.

edit: my dad was very much in the stage yours is, with the pacing and the gibberish. He had a urostomy bag from bladder cancer, which I had to change out, and he would not allow any help with dressing, stopped bathing, and would make big messes in the bathroom. I think this might be a time to talk with your mom and family about full-time care. Your father has a disease, and he needs medical help. Dementia is not just loss of memory.
I started making my mom wear depends when we went on long trips just because she doesn’t know when it’s too late to ask. She just had a tumor removed from her colon so I’m not sure if it’s changed, I haven’t seen her in a month of so because of omnicron
Watch him like a hawk and keep handheld urinals everywhere so you can grab one quickly if you can’t get him to the bathroom in time. You could try a regular bathroom schedule too (bringing him to the toilet every couple hours and seeing if he’ll go.) There will still be some accidents but if you are by his side with a urinal every time he’s on the move, you should be able to reduce them. I’m not a fan of encouraging someone to urinate in their pants (diaper) if they are still continent and mobile. It’s not great for his health and hygiene either. Ripping out the carpet might be a good idea as well. These are the measures I took. It’s extremely tiring no matter what.
We had success with the incontinence underwear -- look at depends or such. Your dad can pull it on like underwear; picture on box is pretty masculine.
They make stick on pads that go into regular underwear for men.  Depending on how much liquid he puts out, that might work.  I want to say they are the Depends brand.  I found them at walmart in with the men's supplies.  Honestly, you could use women's period pads if it's not tons of liquid at a time.  They are cheaper.  I used the Always knock off brand for my dad.  The wings help hold them in place.  I just used the long end up toward the front.  
  Mom uses 'pull ups'.  But she is just told they are her underwear now and she doesn't protest.  
   Good luck, dementia sucks.
Maybe a condom catheter would help?  
They're applied just like a condom, and connected to a drainage bag:

Is it that he doesn't recognize *where* he should be relieving himself or that he can't make it to the bathroom?  If he's just pulling it out and peeing wherever he is I'm not sure diapers will even help.  My FIL would do this sometimes and our best solution was to time his bathroom trips- every hour on the hour whether he thought he needed to or not.
Pull-ups were such a sanity-saver for us while caring for my MIL- she could toilet herself sometimes......but not always (I HATED the time spent cleaning up the messes when they happened). I explained to her that the pull-ups were a new type of underwear (she has severe dementia so she didn’t challenge the “new” underwear). HOWEVER......one of her newer behaviors has been to use her bedroom wastebasket overnight as a toilet (mind you the bathroom is literally across the hall from her bedroom and prominently labeled as such). She’d pull her pull-ups down and pee in the (lined) wastebasket, sometimes even going into the bathroom afterwards to get toilet paper to wipe herself and dispose of that in the wastebasket as well, so pull-ups don’t solve the problem 100% of the time but at least most of the time. I’m thinking that a bedside portable potty might be the next course of action for her when it’s our turn to care for her again (when I was in high school my mom and I did that when my grandmother had Alzheimer’s and she would fall in the middle of the night trying to reach the bathroom). I wish you luck and hope you find a good solution!
YES to buying Depends. Does she think he feels dignity when he and his surroundings are covered in feces?
I don’t think the want for continence aides is unreasonable. And it will definitely be needed sooner rather than later. You can also get discreet styles. I’ve worked in age care with dementia for years and the saying holds true, if there is a will there’s a way, a onesie isn’t going to stop access, he will find a way to it trust me. I’d suggest a 3-4hrly toileting schedule first. If he is regularly toileted then it should reduce accidents around the house. Best of luck",2022-02-19 23:34:24,cannonfunk,swstn1
Dementia,Second mental eval,"Grandma got violent again. Scratched me up and my fiancé good while screaming at us. Couldn’t take it and called cops to have her evaluated again. 

I feel bad that I’m happy they’re keeping her at least for the weekend since nothing is open. They’re looking to put her in an I situation that’s covered by her medical/Medicare. 

Part of my feels bad cuz I know the confusion she must be feeling is out of control. On the other hand I’m angry I’m at her for doing this to us over LAUNDRY. Financially I’m better off with her here, but I’ll give so much more to just have her placed somewhere they can watch her and handle it. 

There’s no help when it comes to public resources. I feel like private institutions are ready to take them always and charge a fortune and public resources say “not our problem”.

I know I’m rambling but I’m just…. Tired.","Yikes. I'm guessing she lives with you. SO - a couple things. 

Do you have Durable Power of Attorney and/or Health Surrogate power?  That's helpful. Also - if the hospital wants to discharge her you might not feel that having her at the house is the safest option - for anyone. IF you feel that way, refuse to accept their discharging her into your care. The key phrase is ""she cannot be safe at home"". It's a hard call, but it *forces* the hospital to find a facility and place her there. 

I know this is super hard, but at some point she's going to really hurt someone or herself. It's good that you can recognize that her behavior isn't ""her"" but the disease, and thinking about how she feels is truly empathetic. Unfortunately if you're her main or only caregiver, you will have to look at the reality of the situation and make a hard call - but that call keeps her safe. 

In all honesty, she may do better in a memory care facility. My mother got the same way - combative and downright out of control - the first few weeks she was in the MC facility she was he\*\* on wheels, but once she settled into a routine and actually took her meds and ate her meals and went to bed, she found a peace that she couldn't have at home. 

I hope things get better for you soon. You've been a wonderful help to your grandmother. Take care.
God I feel you on the no public resources. It's a fucking nightmare or pay $5k minimum a month.   


I'm so sorry this happened to you guys. Take care of yourself, take it easy, and don't feel bad! <3
If she has gotten this bad, she needs medication ASAP. Her behaviors have gotten dangerous for her and for you. I’d start by taking her to the doctor. Getting her behaviors under control will help her immensely to get into a nursing home.
I am so so sorry that this happened to you and your fiancé. I can only imagine the mix of emotions that you’re sitting with right now. And your empathy for your grandmother comes out loud & clear. 
I just want to let you know that your anger is justified, even if your grandmother isn’t in her right mind. No one deserves abuse EVER. Given your circumstances, you did what you needed to do, and all three of you are currently safer for it. Good for you for thinking on your feet and making what I’m sure was a hard call. 
I wish I had answers for you, solutions, something. All I have is words of support. You’re absolutely right; the system we currently have is seriously lacking when it comes to proper, dignified, affordable care for our beloved elders. Hoping you and your fiancé can find some peace tonight, and that there is a more gentle compassionate resolution in sight for your grandmother. I don’t know your story but I know you are amazing for coming this far and caring for her for this long. 💗
((virtual hug)) our dad had dementia and we decided to take care of him at home, which fortunately, my siblings and I were able to do. We considered a facility but the cost was too much. It would have eaten up all his $$ and would have to sell his home before Medicaid would kick in. So we rotated staying with him on his home for 2 1/2 years, he died in June. We had to learn to separate him from the disease. He would sundown pretty bad, so his doctor prescribed low dose Ativan for him at night, he could be a handful and he and whomever was there needed sleep. 

Dementia sicks
Sorry this happened. What was suggested above i.e. ""refusing"" to accommodate her  with you again should force the local hospital/government to look for a facility for her..I can imagine how you feel, just know it's the disease that's making her violent..be at peace with yourself that you're doing all the best you can. I feel you..",2022-02-19 19:21:56,TranceNNy,swo08b
Dementia,Alzheimer's Disease Treatments,"The following quote is probably the key to treating Alzheimer's disease:

""The inflammatory mediator peroxynitrite, when generated in excess, may damage cells by oxidizing and nitrating cellular components. Defense against this reactive species may be at the level of prevention of the formation of peroxynitrite, at the level of interception, or at the level of repair of damage caused by peroxynitrite.""

Nearly all the approved and prospective treatments for Alzheimer's disease limit the production of peroxynitrite.  It is like turning down the faucet on a sink with a stopper, you are only slowing the sink from filling up.  On the other hand, if your turn down the faucet and partially lift up the stopper, you stabilize the amount of water in the sink.  In Alzheimer's disease it is the difference between slowing down the progression of the disease and largely stabilizing it.

If you combine conventional treatments for Alzheimer's disease (such as Aricept and Namenda) that only slow down the formation of peroxynitrite with certain herbs that also scavenge and reverse part of the damage caused by peroxynitrite, the results are always better.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5729264/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5729264/)

[https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/15/2/174](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/15/2/174)

There are currently two drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease that inhibit, scavenge, and partially reverse the damage done by peroxynitrite.  One is Trappsol Cyclo which is now in a phase two clinical trial.  The other is Anavex 2-73 which is in a phase 3 clinical trial.  The initial results are limited (especially for Trappsol Cyclo), but suggest that this approach to treating Alzheimer's disease is very promising.

Dementia,FTD runs in my family and it terrifies me,"My dad was diagnosed with FTD when he was 55 or 56 and passed away at 58. His dad had it too in his 50’s. They have a MAPT mutation that I have a 50% chance of inheriting. I’m about to turn 24. 

I’ve went through waves since learning about my genetic risk of copious research into everything I can find about this until I can think of something to get it off my mind, to spiraling again. Whenever I see someone healthy in their 50’s or later, a part of me feels jealous.

I don’t want to get tested yet, but I will some day. What was keeping me calm was the idea that most scientists are cautiously optimistic there will be at least SOMETHING in 30 years, but now I’m terrified that although for MAPT mutations there is a strong correlation between individual age of onset with mean family age of onset, that I could end up getting this even earlier — in my 30’s or 40’s. Who knows. And I’m worried that because FTD is a less popular dementia than Alzheimer’s that it won’t get the attention it deserves.

It makes me worried that it’ll make it harder to find a partner and get married and have children, although there are ways to have children out there without risking giving the baby the gene. 

I’m constantly reading about the current research on this all, desperately hoping a breakthrough will be had and there will be some treatment for me before it’s too late if I have this.

I think about being a burden to my future partner and kids. Would I be better off dead than a massive financial and emotional burden? 

I just wish there was a treatment for this or something. I’m terrified.","Same here. My mom has it now. I’m 48
idk if my mom specifically had ftd or what but she was affected at a very young age. had to retire in her 30s because she couldn’t remember things anymore, moved into a nursing home before 50 while i was still in high school. i’ve basically sworn off having children out of fear i will end up like my mom and will ruin their lives. 

i get so worried about falling ill. i strongly believe in a wfpb diet for treatment and prevention of most diseases. i made the switch almost a year ago and feel great. it also lessens my health anxiety since i know i’m putting good things in my body. exercise is important too! our lifestyle plays a major part in either activating these genes or letting them remain dormant.

i’m sorry you’re dealing with this in your 20s. it can be very isolating since no one really understands what it’s like to have a parent like this at such a young age.
So sorry you have to deal with this. I carry the C9orf72 expansion. Participating in research is empowering for many and in the US the ALLFTD study recruits at risk people in our families to study. It also ensures you are in regular touch with a neurologist who is an expert in this field.

Dementia,could my stepdad's problem with constantly being a victim of scams be an addiction and not necessarily dementia?,"hello everyone.

my stepdad, (85), has been a victim of scams and it has gotten worse for the past few years. he has a landline, he gets phone calls from scammers asking him to send them money so he can claim his million dollar prize and all the typical scams.

it has brought so much stress to the entire family, especially to my mom (55)

we tried to help in whatever way we could. we tried call blocking, disconnecting the wires of the phone s when the phone ring (pretty much all the calls he gets these days are from scammers and for some weird reason he loves talking to them) but after a few months, when he seemed to have mellowed down, he calls the phone company to reinstate the service or deactivate the features and we're back to square 1. he doesn't have any more money to give. he gets the monthly social security or pension i think, and he just gives them all away. he buys vanilla cards. out of his desperation, he even started borrowing money from friends, and even random people. when he's off to send money to these scammers, he gets very restless and irritable you can't talk him out of it. he even gets really upset.

other than this, he's okay. i mean he's not as sharp as before but he's okay. you can still talk to him. he still remember important dates and appointments. he cleans the yard. etc. 

for years we've been sure that he has dementia, for which based on a test his doctor did to him, he does have early onset dementia but i still want him to see a different doctor which i am pretty sure he would resist to that idea but that's a different story. but yeah, today, i was speaking with my mom, she brought up ""addiction"". she reached out to someone in the VA to seek out help and instead, she was told that what could my stepdad be going through is addiction. now, i am not exactly sure what you'd call an addiction to constantly falling victim for scams.

but it got me thinking, what if my stepdad is? i remember when him and my mom met and he was still alright, about 12 yrs ago, he was even still teaching in school that time, he already had a history of giving money to what seemed like scams, such as resorts, vacation packages, and whatnot.

sorry for the long post, but could there be a possibility that we're treating the wrong condition here? should we be seeking out a therapist for addiction or rehab perhaps? or do you guys think this is just a  plain classic symptom of dementia?

we just don't know what to do with the phones anymore :C

i appreciate any help i could get here or suggestions on how to deal with scammers. and im sure my mom would be very grateful as well. thank you.","There's no reason it can't be both, my dad was very susceptible to scammers as he loved having his ego stroked.  He was into every MLM on the block long before he got dementia.  Getting the phones in her name and putting all of the scam blocks on them she can find sounds like her best option.  She might also consider turning the ring off and just sending everything to voice mail.  Make it clear to everyone that if they want a swift response they should call her cellphone.
This was happening with one of my moms patients. Her husband was stealing her money and giving it to money laundering shit. Idk he was messed up. Somehow they seized his income- so he could only spend what was allowed. It was a social security thing. Idk really because my moms patient died and he was sent to assisted living. For all I know he could still be doing it.
My dad did this early in his dementia journey. Every phone call, publishers clearinghouse, etc. he would order packages and give his personal info to anyone who called. The packages we would return to sender through the post office. When he dropped and broke his phone I got him a new one but under my plan and I set it up for him. No voicemail, only numbers on the favorites list rang through. He keeps his phone with him and looks at it all day every day but has forgotten how to do anything except text. Text was and is still the worst. I go into my phone account daily and look at his text record for outgoing text numbers. Anything that isn’t one of his family numbers gets blocked. He isn’t the wiser. It’s a lot of work but nothing has gotten through in awhile and he hasn’t gotten angry with me the way he did when I was trying to get him to stop sending money and giving out his info to strangers
I don't know about addiction, but wonder if it is loneliness. How much contact does he have with people?
My dad this this and helped us figure out how bad his dementia was. The braces and junk commercials on tv somehow started calling him. One day I got to his house and there were boxes of ""braces"" with claims filed to Medicare. Medicare stated when they got the invoices the claims would be denied automatically as the companies were on the ""fraud list"". From the invoice I called the three companies and one said UPS would pick up their box the next day. The second sent a return label to my email but would not pay. The third said I would have to pay out pocket to return them. It cost $72 to return the junk. We also found out drug addicts were coming to the house, and he would give them $20. It turns out they knew my dad, they were former members of his church. They knew his phone number (same for 50 years) and would call to make sure he was home alone. We all happened to be there when they called, and we reported them to the police. All of these factored in our decision that we would move in with him, rotating days, which we did for 2 1/2 years until he passed in June.
There is a huge thread on a wildly popular social media site, where there is a private group for Dem. In this instance, the Pub Clear House was the issue. Daily calls, daily mail, daily ordering by the mom. Dozens of ppl chimed in about similar cases and suggestions. It was mind boggling to what extent these solicitors do to the elderly. Simply horrendous...
My mother got involved with the Jehovah’s Witnesses some years ago. In hindsight, I suspect she must have had significant vascular dementia during that time. At the time I had chalked it up to depression. JW is basically a MLM scam with religious window dressing.
Yeah it seems like the dementia might be exacerbating some sort of “gambling” addiction
My wife has dementia and had this problem. I eventually had to get rid of our land line. She can handle a cell phone ok, and I set it so only people on her contact list can get through. (and I'm happy to add people to her contacts, as needed) This solved the problem of scammers and telemarketers.",2022-02-19 12:23:28,annaleecage,swf1u7
Dementia,Lucid days,Is it normal to have days with surprising lucidity? My LO with Vascular Dementia (Stage 6) has had a few days this week where it feels like the fog has lifted a bit.,"I feel like it goes from moment to moment, I wish it could last a whole day!
Dementia can be weird.  My husband has dementia with his Parkinson's.  Sometimes he doesn't know what day it is, or whether it's night or day, but he makes perfect sense if we discuss political issues or something else that was on the news.   I've always been terrible with directions, and no matter what his mental status happens to be, when we're in the car, he's still the best navigator I've ever known.  (He doesn't drive, of course.)  We have days when I'm depressed because I've lost the man I married, and then other days when he's so much like his former self I want to freeze time.  He can usually pull himself together for at least a couple of hours if we have company.  So, yes, there can be days with more lucidity than others.  Sorry you are dealing with this.  Every difficult time in my life previous to this seems to pale in comparison.",2022-02-19 01:24:36,Famoggy,sw3d9u
Dementia,my grandma has dementia (in some form or another) and i just really need advice,"to make a long story short my grandma got a uti and got some surgery and it's been a downward spiral ever since. my sister and i are the primary caregivers since my mom works but (and i know its awful to say) i am exhausted. before she was a worrier but now it's worst when mixed with confusion, she keeps going off without her walker and that can get her hurt, i don't know what to do and i could just really use from advice on what best to do.","
Let's begin with there is nothing awful or shameful about being exhausted. It is exhausting taking care of someone with Dementia. The confusion and anxiety lead to a whole different lvl of difficulty. It's OK to feel that way.
       I feel I can speak for everyone on this subreddit who is taking care of a loved one with Dementia that we are ALL right there with you. Totally and utterly exhausted.
           To start with I would get in contact with her Doctor and see if they can prescribe something for the anxiety. There are lots of options out there. It's only going to help. Once the cognitive state changes and they become confused, unsure of where they are when they are. Etc. That leads to unrealistic worries, anxiety, stress and restlessness that are hard to overcome because it's next to impossible to reason with them at that point. ( they are living in altered reality, and you can't convince them otherwise).
The best things to do in this situation is distract. Crafts, games, put on her favorite music, movies, go for a walk do hee hair paint nails anything you can think of.  Have her help you with something. Dishes, folding laundry. Etc. Keeping them busy and engaged are very helpful in those moments.  
     ""Baby proof"". Put those baby locks on the tops of doors so she can't go out of the house without help. If you have stairs get a tall baby gate with a swinging door. Make sure its wall mounted ( screwed into the wall). Maybe attatch bells to it so if she is trying to open it you can hear it and get there ASAP. 
Make sure walkways are clear rugs corners are down flat etc. To minimize the chances of tripping and falling. You get it. 
    Decorate her walker. Get stickers,paint,stick on gems whatever you can think of. Make it a project do it together maybe. Or surprise her.   Making it look pretty or fancy , unique will probably  help because it won't just look like any old walker If that makes sense.  It will intice her (hopefully) to use it more. 
     There's activity books you can get on Amazon or just online. Busy pillows ( you could honestly make one of those yourself if you wanted)  just search activities for Dementia patients and a bunch of stuff will pop up. 
  Consider seeing if she qualifies for hospice. Or palliative care. Her doctor will be able to tell you and if she does then that will only add another layer of resources and support for ALL of you. 
And this last part is very important. Take time for yourself. It's easy to get burnt out. Trust me. I know. You have to remember that you matter too eventhough your world is basically revolving around her and her needs, wants and safety you have to take care of yourself. 
Im sorry you are going through this. Its not easy. I hope some of this helps.  You found the right place to get lots of info, advice and just support in general. 
 Sending strength and love your way. Hang in there. It's tough but you've got this.
Never feel guilty. There is no one right way dealing with a dementia person. Each case is different and it’s mentally demanding. Nothing will ever feel completed because it constantly changes with them. Never feel ashamed to put them into a home if the care requirement is larger than you can support. There are plenty of other ways to support them if they are in a home. In saying that in the mean time, just redirection, pushing fluids to prevent ITI’s and improving mobility, plus encouragement of walker use. Sometimes there’s not much more you can do. You have to accept that falls are a possibility. You can only ever do your best and if you have done that than there can be no guilt left to felt.",2022-02-19 01:23:12,Melodic-Ad-2541,sw3chz
Dementia,newly diagnosed family--advice or kind words?,"Hi all. My mom has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia at the age of 73 and is struggling badly with the diagnosis and her changing cognitive ability. She is likely experiencing some sundowner-like symptoms. She is crying a lot, often in the evenings, repeating things like ""I just want to be me"". 

She's always been a powerhouse in the family, thinking of herself as a bit of a matriarch--always caring for others, taking care of house and home, etc. Very ""in control"" of herself and, in her eyes, her family. That said, she's clearly not coping with me needing to take over handling the finances, or my sibling and I doing more around the house. I've tried to get her to talk about what she's feeling. I imagine there is a grieving process involved here, voluntary or involuntary, for all of us. 

She's also been a caretaker for our father for a few years now--he is not in good shape physically, and we are faced with the fact that we will need to move them out of their house and into a place that is equipped to care for them. My wife and live out of state, but I'm within a day's drive and am spending more time with my parents as I can. My sibling lives in here in the same town with them.

Last week, her doc told her that this could be the most difficult time of her illness because she is still alert enough to be aware of it and of her mental struggles. She even hinted that things would get easier when she is no longer cognitively aware enough to know of her illness. I don't know the truth of that, but I'm reaching out here, with tears in my eyes, asking for kind words and any advice.","I am so sorry. I’m in a similar boat with my 74 yr old mom. Perhaps the dr can recommend a therapist to help her discuss this sensitive topic? She sounds strong and stoic… she may not want to “burden you” with being her therapist on top of all else.

*big hugs*
I am so sorry. We lost our dad to dementia in June. We were able to, the 5 of us, to take care of him 24/7 for 2 1/2 years in his home. I wish o could say how we coped during that period, but by the time we realized he had a problem, he was far down the road. He hid it well until we figured out he wasn’ eating, he would put our plate in the microwave and forget it was there. Then we started comparing symptoms and a neurologist confirmed it. She tried aricept but it was too late. Fortunately while I mother was alive, they both signed POA and POH paperwork so I was able to handle his business w/o any problems

Dementia sucks
Ohh, so sorry, that's hard for you all, and sad.   Go check out your area dementia .org & alzheimers .org, tons of expert experienced resources, tips & advice, counselling, fact-sheets, management strategies, telephone help-lines, etc - everything for memory-loss issues for the memory-lossed and their families / friends / carers.   

Yes, it's generally true I think - gets perhaps somewhat easier for themselves when they lose that ability to recognize that their mental faculties are slipping / have slipped - they're happily oblivious, blundering through life.   So sorry, it's tough.   Best of luck!
Ugh. Sorry about the terrible diagnosis. Yes, it is true that most (not all) people with dementia lose awareness of their deficits. I don't think I would want anyone to tell me that if I had dementia because it would be terrifying to think that I would be that ""out of it"".  Unfortunately, that often brings a new set of challenges for the caregiver since the person thinks there is nothing wrong with them and everyone else is lying, just wants to take their money, etc. If you like to read, good sources of helpful info are ""Understanding the Dementia Experience"" by Jennifer Ghent Fuller (you can find a free copy online) and the book ""The 36 hour day"". Hang in there.
My dad (62) is still very much in denial of his diagnosis most days.  


To you and your mum, I won't lie and say it gets easier but some days will still be good days. Remember to put you first.
You may be able to get her on an antidepressant or mood stabilizer. My grandma takes a very low dose of Citalopram once a day. She tends to have anger issues (did so before her diagnosis in life) and it has leveled her out. But I do believe they go through grief even if they aren't actively aware. I watched my grandma process it and it took years. She stayed in anger a long time (hence the meds). Counseling is not a bad idea if she is up to it. Earlier in the day is better for those conversations because of sun-downing or just general mental exhaustion. Routines help too. You're all going to grieve a long the way. Depending on how rapid the decline is. It's a hard journey.
I would suggest speaking with her doc about medication which may help her during this time.  My husband has dementia and he is aware of what is going on one minute and unaware the next. It is quite the roller coaster. He was never a take charge person so is comfortable with me doing everything for him. I can't imagine the pain and fear of knowing you are losing yourself and will soon turn into a person who is 100% dependent on others while not knowing the people who are caring for you anymore. I am so sorry for anyone who has this disease and for those of us who have to watch this awful decline.  Let go of the idea that you should get her to talk about what is happening. She should know you are there for her but let her have whatever control she has left as she will soon have none.  Good luck.
I’m so sorry you’re experiencing this! Alzheimer’s is an awful disease. My mom was just diagnosed at age 70, though we had suspected for several years. 

We have focused on her strengths (riding horses, spending time with family and friends) while taking away the burden of things that are more difficult for her (filling her medications, cleaning the house, cooking). I find that taking things off her plate as a helpful gesture keeps the frustration at a minimum. Also keeping tasks to one step or so at a time keep her feeling more in control of the task. 

I hope this helps! Alz.org has some great tips and a chat line if you have questions or need support.
No real advice beyond what's been said, but these kind words: you're not alone. My partner has been showing early onset signs for years, and her medical providers have been hella slow until gobsmacked in the face with evidence. We're on the verge of official diagnosis, which feels like a form of relief, if not good news. You've got the medical people, spouse, and a sibling on the same page as you—from what I've seen in this sub, blessings that are not always a given. 

Love doesn't conquer all in dementia-land, but it goes a long way in reassuring us all that we are all doing the best we can with the cards we've been dealt. And you're welcome to come back here to rant, whine, and scream as necessary. We hold each other up.
I lost my mom in 2020 to dementia after 7 years of very rapid decline. She was 62. Love them. Be there as much as you can. You will go through hell. Get the most out of ever lucid moment they have and when they are lost...roll with it. Laugh at silly moment together, humor in this horror is your best Ally. Fake being strong when you're with them...inside they are terrified, they know something is wrong but not what. I never let her see me cry when I was with her. Maybe that was wrong, but she needed something to grab hold of, any reassurance. I would scream and curse god alone. Most of all just love them then love them even more.",2022-02-19 00:17:16,JSonofGlad,sw2a2b
Dementia,Preparing for demebtia,"I was wondering if anyone thinks a ""diary"" of people I knew, nicknames I had , songs in my childhood, etc so that if my mind loses ""now"", others, caregivers have a list of things that may be more relevant to my mental state.  

I know Alzheimers sometimes take patients backwards to early memories. I  I'm hoping it might happen to me in the middle stages.","A diary might help - but also make picture books. One with family, one with friends, maybe one that's job related or whatever volunteer activity you like to do. My dad seems to remember faces more than abstract stuff like text, and he's losing his ability to read. 

Music is a big boon, too. Great to have a google home or some device that can just stream music all the time.
My only suggestion would be not to go digital. I know Amazon and Google have both tried pushing for integrating a person's memories onto social to help with dementia. But I've dealt with a great-grandmother, 2 grandparents, an uncle and my mother with various forms of dementia and technical things go by the wayside or cause huge amounts of frustration in the middle stages. Books are something most people have had since they could sit up, they can operate a book.

Dementia,"Medication resistant mom, what is point of diagnosis?","As title says, my mom is resistant to take new meds. So, I am wondering what is the point of bothering with a diagnosis if she won’t DO ANYTHING about it?

Would it help me when I need to take over her medical care or finances? (I have a POA already)

What more is a diagnosis good for besides treatment?

Thanks in advance. For reference, we are in the U.S.","If she's not diagnosed then you won't know if it's something else that is reversible.  A dementia diagnosis is largely based on excluding all of the other possibilities. If her financial POA is the ""springing"" variety, which requires a doctor to say she is incapacitated, then you will need the diagnosis to use it. If she does have dementia, she's not missing out on much by not taking the standard ""treatment"" meds. If you ever have to treat severe behaviors however, such as aggression or delusions, the medications for that are very effective and essential and it is helpful to know what kind of dementia she has because some medications cause a dangerous adverse reaction in certain types of dementia.
Yes yes yes get the POA. Also, does she take any vitamins? I got my mom to take the pills disguised as vitamins. But the pills won’t reverse anything, just slow it down. Eventually I opted for “quality of life”, which meant putting her on lexipro which took the edge off of her and brought my mom back to a new normal.
The diagnosis made me feel safer. My grandmother tells people that I’m stealing from her purse, sneaking in her room at night to shake her, and other things like that. I worried before her diagnosis that someone would come after me for the things she makes up so I feel better knowing that a doctor can back me up about her having delusions.
I'm so sorry you're facing this. I see you're an only child, and that she is without family too. I'm in the same boat. It's a lot. 

For whatever it's worth, if you do indeed get the diagnosis, you will likely need to adopt a slew of white lies to keep her safe. This will likely include hiding or disguising medicine. Before I moved my mum into long term care, she got a pudding cup for dessert with several of her meds crushed up into it. (Check with doctors if you go this route... Some meds can't be crushed.) None of this will feel good or normal, but ""therapeutic lies"" are quite common in managing dementia.

Best wishes to you.
The diagnosis will help with services as her disease progresses, also medications can help, but apparently she won’t comply. 

It will be easier for you to have the dx now, and arrangements for medical and full POA, an advanced directive is a good idea, too. Having the dx in place helps because it will be avail you of help from Alzheimer’s Association, aid with daily living, enrichment programs, caregiver respite, etc rather than having to scramble to get testing and dx later.
Agree with the other posters here.  Getting a diagnosis even without testing it can open you up to resources that you might not have without it.

Mine is also very resistant to any new meds. She also functions well still and is independent but with declining executive function.  She wants to read and study the package inserts and then perseverates on all the negative side effects. All of them!!!! OMG. So frustrating.

In the end, it is a battle that I’m not really interested in fighting. If she is willing to take them, fine. If she’s not, fine. I told her it will only help her but can’t cure her. Her decision. She takes the antidepressants from her psychiatrist so so I’m fortunate for that.
In California, not sure about other states, (at least some) memory care places cannot legally accept someone without a dementia diagnosis from a physician. It limited our options because my parent did not have one.
Diagnosis is very important when help is needed later on. A diagnosis can allow a person to be eligible for services such as home health care, memory unit in a care facility (this may be very important later on!), Hospice, etc. 
Diagnosis will also tell other providers important information about what other medical treatment is acceptable. For example, a person with dementia should not have general anesthesia unless it is a VERY serious condition because it often leads to a lot of deterioration.

Medications can help slow the progression of symptoms of dementia, but will not treat it. 
If it causes a fight everyday to try to get her to take it, it may not be worth it. Like you commented earlier, quality of life is most important.

Good luck. Make sure to take care of yourself and get support when you need it.
Sorry you have to deal with all this. Remember to look out for yourself, as they get more difficult you are going to have to make decisions to take of your own sanity first.
Diagnosis can actually be very helpful in getting funding, but only in certain situations. It is unfortunately a slippery slope. However, it would be beneficial and helping her get proper treatment as well.
I am in a similar boat as you: my mom’s situation and staging sounds really close to yours. I wish i had answers, All I can say is that you sound like a caring, supportive family member.
I’m not sure about in the States but in Canada it allows for social service help, tax write-offs, nursing home assistance, etc. Plus just having it seems to allow others more compassion somehow (sad though that might be).",2022-02-18 18:58:54,GenXKaren,svw733

Some neurologists swear by Mediterranean diet. Look up the MIND diet.
Just reas the 30 Day Alzheimer's Solution cookbook, and they say not to use coconut oil. I was surprised because I'd been reading in general health news over the last few years how much better it is than other oils.
My mom, diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia, has been taking CBD oil for anxiety for nearly 5 years and donepezil for memory loss. CBD doesn’t do anything for her memory loss but does seem to be the best treatment for keeping her anxiety in check. Donepezil seems to be keeping further decline at bay (taking it for about 2 years now).

To be frank Im not worried about my english right now. I thought we would at least have a couple more days with him, but my grandfather's health has deteriorated so much over the last 24 hours. We have him set up at home, and he's on very large amounts of morphine. His breathing is very shallow and irregular. He is so frail. It hurts to look at him, but I spent my evening standing by his bedside and holding his hand. The doctors reassured me he is in no pain. I wish there was a way to be able to know that he knows how loved he is. I wish he could reassure me that he knows I love him. Death is always apart of life, but I don't want him to feel alone. I hope my actions were enough.

I want to thank everyone who read and replied to my last post. I cannot express how much I am thankful. Your words and time was not wasted, thank you.","I am so very sorry for your loss.

Dementia,The signs,"The question about early signs of dementia got me going on a trip down memory lane, tagging the signposts of my mother-in-law's dementia.  We should have seen it for what it was much sooner.

Spring 2014 she made a left turn with oncoming traffic, causing a truck to hit the passenger side of her car.  My daughter, who was living with MIL at the time, was in the front passenger seat. MIL said daughter had been driving --  we thought MIL was shaken up from the accident. She insisted it was other other driver's fault. It wasn't.

After MIL and daughter attended a music camp together in summer 2014, daughter decided she didn't want to live with MIL anymore because MIL was angry all the time.

2015 - MIL had another accident. This time she ran into the side of her own house while parking her car in her driveway.

Summer 2015 - MIL went back to the music camp, stayed with her daughter (my sister-in-law). MIL complained that ""people"" were changing her class schedule and not telling her, people were mean to her and not letting her participate in workshops she was supposed to go to (she was trying to go to other people's lessons).

Feb. 2016 - MIL caused a three car accident and fled the scene.  On her way home from church, she decided to go to McDonald's for coffee, and ended up in a school parking lot, miles from the church, her home, or the closest McDonald's.  She pulled out of the parking lot into a five-lane street (two traffic lanes each north and south, central turn lane) cutting across four of the five lanes, causing two other cars to hit her and each other. She stopped but when the cop showed up she drove away. Her explanation was that she didn't know she had to talk to the cop and she was going home. Except she had no idea where she was and she insisted she hadn't done anything wrong.

(After that accident, the owner of the body shop called me to tell me she really shouldn't be driving anymore, even though she was really good for business)

Even after that, it took another year before my husband and his sisters got her to move into independent living and took her car away. She was there less than 3 years, the last part of which my husband was going to her apartment every evening to make her go to dinner because if he didn't go, she wouldn't eat.  

She moved in with us 2 years ago. She still bitches about the car.","Bummer.. yea the signs are all there. My mother gifted her new car to me because she never drove it, and was afraid to because it was “too electronic”. This was in 2018. To this day she thinks it’s her car, or I stole it even tho she has never driven it since 2017, or can’t recall ever purchasing it (my father did). Dementia is a bitch.
Dementia sucks
My adult niece(by marriage)called me tonight quite cheerful. I asked what was up and she said she and her mother, former sister n law, were on their way to pick up her dad. He was in a small town about 20 minutes away from where we live. She said he took the keys and went for a drive and must have made a wrong turn🤔he ended up in the driveway of a very kind man who took the time to find out who and where he belonged and finally found a phone number in the car. Mind you my niece says he has a card with information about his pacemaker🤔
Turns out they have been letting him drive around their subdivision to visit friends. His drivers license expired but they took him to get it renewed hoping he would fail the test. Not only does he have dementia, he’s declined quite a bit, but his blood pressure bottoms out, he gets dizzy and she has to give his salt. He’s had several falls also. I am at a loss for words. My dad died in June from dementia, we took care of him 24/7 at his home for 2 1/2 years and she knew everything we were going thru because we talk every day. We took our dad’s keys garage door opener checkbook no mail coming to the house and installed padlocks so he couldn’t go upstairs or out the side door.

Contact your local Alzheimer’s group for advice.

Who is the Power of Atty? This needs to be established ASAP as well as Advanced Medical Directive.
I'm sorry you're in this difficult position. I would contact NC Aging and Adult Services. They can guide you through your options.
https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/aging-and-adult-services
NC may have a different way of doing things than my state (Washington), but here's our strategy for my ex-MIL (long story, we're still close). She's currently in an assisted living facility that also has rooms that qualify for Medicaid. What usually happens is an elderly person will sell their home and use the proceeds to pay for their care for as long as the money lasts. Then Medicaid takes over. Any money they make from Social Security goes towards the care, and then Medicaid pays the rest.

There's what's called a ""Medicaid lookback period"" of 5 years, so you can't sell his house and distribute the money to his relatives, for example. Any assets he's had over the last 5 years will be counted towards the out-of-pocket amount Medicaid requires. There's no getting away from that, unfortunately.

Definitely do as another posted said and contact NC Aging and Adult Services. They can explain this in more detail.

Dementia,I’m dealing with someone at my work that I think has dementia. Can you please share some stories of when you first realized something close to you was off and how that progressed to a diagnosis?,,"I was once hired to replace someone who left due to Alzheimer’s. Now that I know more about dementias, I’m not certain it was AZ or just that everyone said it was because that’s the best known type. 

Here’s what it sounded like from what I heard. He suddenly needed help doing tasks he should have been able to do and understand with little thought. He would go to trusted coworkers and ask for help on the simplest of tasks. They did a reorg to place him under someone who knew enough of the job to supervise him and redo work when the data did not look correct. Someone eventually talked to his wife to express concern. I don’t know if he was already diagnosed or if this conversation spurred it, but it didn’t take too long after that for him and his wife to initiate a leave of absence and then his departure. 

Since I inherited his office, I can tell you it was a mess. Maybe he was disorganized and a clutter hound before. His desk had a broken leg and was basically propped up. When maintenance saw that when I was hired, they insisted I get a new desk because they were afraid I would get hurt. There were multiple old computers stacked up in the office along the walls. Filing cabinets were full of old random papers that made no sense. Just piles and stacks of stuff. Yet, there was not a single pen or pencil in the desk. The disorganization and crazy notes and notations showed me he was clinging to anything he thought might help him figure out how to do his job but had no ability to organize it or decide what was useful and what wasn’t. In looking at some of those old papers, I could see a former brilliance and learned quite a bit just from reading them.
Common early indicators are general widespread forgetfulness: forgetting EDC at home; going somewhere to get something and forgetting what they went for, where they are, or how to get back; forgetting words (like, ""you know that thing in the sky that we get in for trips"" for airplane);...

What are you seeing that's suggesting possibly dementia?  Not that it's a huge indicator anymore, but how old is this person?  Male or female?  General health status?
The first symptom I noticed with my grandma was her hearing sounds/auditory hallucinations. She kept insisting her sweet, quiet neighbors were having wild parties. 

This quickly progressed to visual hallucinations and having false ideas about situations. She also became very paranoid and couldn’t reason. This made it impossible to enlist help for years and it was horrible. She also lived across the country so it was extremely difficult to check in regularly enough. 

The hallucinations would come to a head (neighbors calling police) and a big part of it was due to her repeated UTIs. She’d get treatment, do well for a few months, and then revert back to the hallucinations. 

She was never particularly forgetful until much later in her progression. She drove her car well into her 90s (her license actually just expired and she’s 100) and lived independently with immaculate housekeeping until age 93…despite dealing with these symptoms for a good five years or more prior to me forcing her to move down here. 

I’d say hallucinations and an inability to reason were what I noticed first.
Poor hygiene, memory looping (repeating the same things over and over again within minutes), anxiety, rage (I suspect because they know something is wrong but they don’t understand), repeatedly missing appointments or going to them a day early, not paying attention to finances, constant “No Filter Friday” (my mom would ask totally inappropriate questions or say things that were really embarrassing).  

Have you spoken to their boss or HR about your coworker?
Bad driving. Really bad.

Anger (""People"" are changing things, ""someone"" is hiding things).
I'm a high school teacher and we had two teachers basically diagnosed by students who went on to get diagnosed by a doctor. Both started repeating themselves, confusing or forgetting names, musing up papers from different classes, etc.
I have a coworker whose mother died of alzheimers.  He is 58 and has worked at the company for 30 years. I went to lunch with his new boss who told me the guy made all these notes in meetings but could not remember a thing even when looking at notes. So she tried to get him fired! Well management was not happy with that so they transferred him to another department and gave him 6 months to find a new job. 6 months came and went and he is still here. Nice to work for a compassionate company.
The first sign with my mom, years ago, was non stop talking.  She’d be on the phone with me all day if I let her continue.  It wasn’t a conversation- it was non stop old stories on repeat with a few new stories complaining about the neighbors.  When she called my sister (who lived close by) to come and fix her “broken” car (in wrong gear so it wouldn’t start) we knew she needed more supervision and I moved her out by me to semi-assisted living, good weather and more attention.  But the other symptoms came up after that.

Short version- weird non stop talking without seeming to be aware that the other person wasn’t saying anything back other than “uh huh”.
Fixation on certain topics, bringing them up over and over again. And not being able to learn new things (a door lock, use the new tv remote). And also forgetting things out of sight- leaving cups of tea around or forgetting to take food out of the microwave.

In the very early days it was mood swings and irritability. 

It only progressed to diagnosis years later, and it was difficult to encourage them to go to the doctor. They may be angry at you for bringing it up but that subsides eventually when they accept it themselves. 

I have no idea how you would broach this topic with your boss, that would be very difficult. Perhaps you could take advantage of a time where you have to remind him of something, and suggest they see a doctor under the guise of vitamin deficiency or tiredness/ stress - something that isn't suggesting they have dementia.
With my dad, it was forgetting what was said earlier in the conversation, repeating himself, forgetting something simple. He was never very organized, but we found notes of simple things like phone numbers that should be in his phone repeated, times for meetings, simple reminders all over the place. Things not done that he would normally do well, like lawn care or fixing broken stuff on the house. 

Your coworker’s temperament is something you’ll have to gauge. Dementia, regardless the cause, is tricky because the person doesn’t necessarily notice how bad their initial decline is, despite it being concerning to those around them. They see it as being forgetful sometimes, but their own mind doesn’t know how bad it is. They have their coping mechanisms to get by…until they can’t. Then it’s a struggle to get the financial and medical care they need quick enough. Honestly, the earlier it is caught, the better care and more independence they will have for longer. 

I really don’t know how to go about this in a professional setting. Maybe pose this question on ask a manager to see what they would recommend about how to proceed at work? If you only talk to him privately, there’s a good chance he’ll forget to follow through on seeing the doctor. I know my dad hid his condition and fought us with it, maybe this person would be happy that someone tried to help him? I don’t know. His next of kin will be the ones who need to step in to manage his care to ensure he goes to the doctor.
Lots of repeated stories even within a short time frame. When my mom started showing signs, she would tell an anecdote and a few minutes later tell the same one without even realizing. Lots of things go undone, housework, medication planning, feeding animals, etc. That is what I dealt with mostly.

Dementia,Driving evaluations?,"Has anyone had their loved one’s driving evaluated by an OT as prescribed by their neurologist? Also has anyone had their loved one sign a “driving contract” stating when the caregivers notice problems with driving, the person with Dementia will give up their right to drive? How did you approach the contract and how did the interaction go?","My mom's doctor witnessed her driving erratically in the clinic parking lot and yanked her driver's license on the spot.  That was in 2019 and she complained about it for two years, blaming my sister (who wasn't even in the state at the time).  We told her she was free to get a driver's license whenever she wanted to go to the DMV and re-take the written and driving tests, but somehow she hasn't found the time.  She still bitterly resents not having a car, though she pretends she doesn't \*want\* to drive.  One thing that made her happy was getting her a state ID card from the DMV.  She has no idea it's not a driver's license.  

I don't think any sort of contract would help, because the person with dementia usually thinks they're fine, and the caregiver/doctor/family are exaggerating and don't know what  they're talking about.  They might agree to accept the caregiver/doctor/family's judgement at the time of the agreement, but when push comes to shove ""I'm fine!!""  

I think the important thing is to get the loved one's abilities assessed by an outside person, whether doctor or other qualified person.  Then if they are deemed too impaired to drive, immediately take away both the driver's license and the car.  This is important, because if you are the responsible person and allow access to the car you can have some liability if there's a crash.  

Get financial power of attorney first so you have authority to sell the car.
Greenswizzle is right in that any kind of contract with your  will be denied/disputed by your loved one.  

My mom refused to give up driving and we were all scared to death.  She was able to fake her mental state well enough that she actually got her license renewed.  Fortunately, I think her insurance agent had enough conversations with Mom know something was off, and sent her a standard form requiring her to get a doctor to sign off that she was OK to drive.  I called the doc ahead of the assessment appointment and told him my concerns.  Thankfully he knew Mom wasn’t right and checked no wrt her ability to drive.  Mom was furious, and even after hiding keys, she would find an extra we didn’t know about and drive the car.  Finally the keys were put in a safe, and then we sold the car.  Soon after that we moved her to assisted living. Best of luck to you.
Yes, my mother was  evaluated by an OT concerning her driving skills. This was back in 2019, and she promptly failed this test.

We placed the ""blame"" on the doctor & the OT who told her that she shouldn't be driving.
Yes. Had an official OT evaluation at one of the post acute rehabilitation centers. It apparently involved both a cognitive evaluation as well as reaction time testing in a simulated driving environment. She failed the cognitive portion significantly and almost passed the reaction time, but missed it by a hair. This cost was out of pocket but it was worth it just to officially take driving off the table. 

Of course, she said she did not realize that she would not be able to drive after the test and would not have taken it if she had known. She was very, very mad for a long time afterwards and is still upset that she cannot drive. She was very independent so obviously this is very difficult. But since she moved to a new place, I did not think there was any way she was going to be able to find her way around or even get out of the driveway without significant difficulty. She has driving services at her new place but she is not really organized enough to get that together for herself. I certainly feel bad about that but there’s so much I can do. I take her to all her appointments as it is. She has made friends with cars so I guess it kind of worked out socially.

For me, it supported my opinion that she really should not be driving anymore. She never got lost but had several fender benders and her car was pretty dinged up. It’s still very difficult for me as I feel like to took away a part of her independence. But I have to keep reminding myself that they worst thing that could’ve happened would have been she killed herself or someone else and I would have to be the one to clean up the mess and ultimately live with the consequences.
It was never official for my mom. Her doctor knew she'd be unreasonable and angry if she had her license pulled so we went a different route. The doctor had switched one of her meds, something insignificant in reality, but told Mom until she'd evaluated how she handled the meds, she didn't want her to drive. Mom agreed. She kept forgetting to ask about it when we went back to the doctor and the phone was too confusing for her to dial numbers she didn't know by heart, reading them and inputting them was too much, so she never asked. Sometimes she'd demand that one of us needed to call for her but oops, we didn't get through, or it was after hours or whatever the excuse of the moment was. My brother lived with her and took the keys to her SUV, kept them in a locked box except when he was using the vehicle.",2022-02-18 11:06:37,Cbark2580,svlj2o
Dementia,Looking for a way to calm my dad down in the evenings,Hi all. My dad's been suffering for a few years with dementia. He's probably at his worst in the evenings (sundowning). I try to take him out for a walk when I can but just wondering if anyone can advise anything else to try. He's on a bit of a cocktail of drugs which don't seem to be helping much. We thought maybe CBD oil might calm him but not sure if it's a good idea and might be too expensive without prescription. Has anyone given a dementia sufferer CBD oil or found any other solution. Thanks.,"Try playing music he likes in the afternoon. I do this when my mother's sundowning acts up and it works wonders. I've created a couple different YouTube playlists for this particulary.
Have you tried melatonin? I give my mom melatonin and keep a regular bedtime every night and wake her every day to keep a schedule going. It has helped her keep a pretty regular sleep schedule and it has seemed to help her with sundowning.
One thing we do at work is try to keep lights on around them. Sundowning is partially triggered by a decrease in light so if you give them a well lit place, it will hopefully help some. 

I've also learned that if they're in another place or time to just go with them if possible. Trying to bring them back to your reality will only confuse and upset them even more.
CBD gummies and oils are discussed alot on other forums/social media. Some it works great and some it doesn't. If you state has cannabis stores, go and talk to them.
CBD did nothing at all for my mom.  Our hope was that it would relieve her constant anxiety, though, not sundowning. For sundowning, melatonin worked to help get her to sleep at a regular time (but did not help her STAY asleep). Activity, when she'd do it in the morning, helped with the sundowning in the afternoon. But everyone is different - it's worth a try! 

\[Side note: CBD is not a prescription thing, at least in the US. There are tons of online sites that sell it at different price points, but they are all usually a lot cheaper than the bizarre ""got cbd"" shops that pop up in strip malls etc. Look at google reviews to find a good one.\]
Are you in a state with medical weed?  maybe an eatable?
My mom would start getting anxious and sometimes aggressive when she was sundowning...increase in confusion, forgets evening meds, etc. Her neurologist gave her quetiapine for the evenings and it worked really well. Instead of sleeping erratically and waking up at 2AM thinking it's 10AM and clattering around the kitchen, etc, she gets sleepy within an hour of taking it then sleeps 8-10hrs straight and is in a better mood. She still gets aggressive and has mood swings but they are less frequent and she seems well rested at the very least. 

Although I would definitely get a kick out of seeing her after a THC edible...lol
Contact [this](http://www.organichempsociety.com) buyers club and tell them what's going on and that price is an issue. They usually send a free bottle so you can try it. They will also give you dosage advice. Tell them his age weight and what meds he is on.  They will probably recommend 3 drops 3Xs a day. peace",2022-02-18 05:04:36,afox1984,svefen
Dementia,"Mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, but speech and problem solving seem worse than memory.","I know these things are complex and present differently, but I feel like whenever I see a video of someone with Alzheimer’s, they speak fine, seem relatively put together, but they just can’t remember things. My mom’s memory certainly isn’t good, but she mostly has trouble getting words out and remembering how to do simple things. 

Thoughts?","Different types of dementia present differently. Look up fronto-temporal dementia, for example - some types are as you describe (difficulty with speech and language more than just memory).
As a few other people said, Alzheimer's can present differently in different people. It all depends on what part of the brain it is damaging, and what those parts of the brain control. 

Also, as far as memory goes...the short term memories are usually the first to be affected. Your long term memories have been solidified in the brain ages ago when the brain was healthier. With the brain being damaged, it is hard to impossible for the brain to solidify the new memories. But when you start getting to the severe and end stages, even the parts of the brain with the long term memories can be damaged.
As someone mentioned below, look into Frontotemporal Dementia. My mother was diagnosed about six months ago after two years of having trouble conversating. Her memory is all there, but there are issues with paraphrasing, mixing up words, etc.
My mom was recently diagnosed too. It’s affecting her reasoning in addition to her ability to get words out. She used to be really frugal and now we’re finding she’s spending money in ways she never would have previously. I always thought Alzheimer’s was about memory loss and it’s been really shocking to see these other changes instead. Sorry you’re dealing with this too.
My dad had dementia and he forgot the right word for something. The pointer was a tv remote, etc. We learned ""his language"" which frustrated him less. He died June 5th, his 90th birthday was May 6th. Somehow, someway he always knew when it was his birthday and he kept track of how old he was by subtracting the year he was born from the current year, which we could never figure out how he knew....such is dementia
My dad is pretty deep into dementia now but one of the main symptoms from the beginning that we noticed was the aphasia. Just like what you describe is happening with your mom. His talk eventually just became nonsense gibberish. He lived with me for a while and I learned to understand what he might be saying or needing, but now he's in full-time memory care and it's pretty much all gone. Sounds, no words. It's one of those awful symptoms of this horrible disease.
My mom is also losing her language ability, first. She has Alzheimer’s, but a rare presentation: Logopenic Primary Progressive Aphasia. To give an example, here’s what she wrote in my Valentine’s Day card:

“My beautiful daughter! I love you more than you in my life is and in all much for you. You live you, and I love you more wonderful for my life. I hope have a happy day and ‘Happiness Always!’

I love you always,
Mom”


I cherish it, but it shatters me. Just last year, she wrote a beautifully coherent message. 😞
My LO has vascular dementia. It affected her speech first. I think a lot of doctors just assume, since it's the most common form of dementia, that it's safe to call it Alzheimer's.",2022-02-17 21:41:37,MsAndDems,sv6qr4
Dementia,Yaaaay ( sarcasm ) Starting that Medicaid Application,"Can't wait for this nightmare to start, and end.

Any advice?","Hoo boy. We just went through this. Be prepared to have the patience of a saint, and keep reminding yourself that you're dealing with the government, and they're not that invested if you get benefits or not. It's a slog.

We ended up hiring a company that manages the Medicaid application for you, and pulls all the financial records and anything else that's required, files everything, and keeps on top of the entire process so it runs as smoothly as possible. It's still not smooth. They weren't cheap, either, but time was of the essence for us.

Even then, it took nearly 8 months to be successful. Medicaid denied us (they didn't bother to download the forms which we had receipt of sending) and that happens at least 30% of the time, according to the company we hired. Every time they had to review a document it took another week or two for them to respond.

Medicaid: You didn't send your forms. You're denied.

Us: Yes we did. We have receipt from your office.

Medicaid: Oh. We'll check. Wait ten days.

(Ten days later)

Medicaid: Those forms are outdated. They're only valid for a week. You'll have to resubmit.

You know, that kind of government crap. 

Good luck.
If you possibly can afford one hire an attorney that specializes in elder care.
Make copies of EVERYTHING you send to the Medicaid office and to your lawyer. We have been going through this since July. Still not done.
It’s a tenuous process usually, but it tends to help if your loved one is on hospice.
I believe this is a different process depending on your state. I was expecting it to be awful, but as compared to dealing with the VA, the Medicaid application process was pretty quick and easy. It was initially declined due to income with the VA benefit disqualifying her, but the gal who handled the appeal was amazing-determined that a portion of the VA benefit would not be counted as income, and she was able to get it approved without ever actually having an appeal hearing. During that short appeal process, this gal called ME to follow up and keep things moving. She also gave me her direct number. She was incredible. 

Now that she’s approved-I can handle requests for info online, and I’m rather impressed with the system. Overall it was pretty painless.
Is your LO going into a nursing facility?  The one my mom is in actually helped with that - I just had to provide the documentation (which was challenge enough because my mom's apartment looked like something straight out of ""Hoarders"".  I also lucked out and had a great case manager at Medicaid that called me every step of the way.  My mom had a little bit of spend down - they told me the exact amount and what I needed to do with the money.",2022-02-17 17:55:06,radioactiverobot,sv1vbo
Dementia,“Bugs are biting me”,"My wife, with obvious, but undiagnosed (since she absolutely, angrily, refuses to go see any dr) dementia, is regularly complaining about being bitten by bugs. It’s not the season, and I’ve not had any bites. She shows me some skin mark sometimes, but no clear bites. 

Has anyone else encountered this? I’ve not read anything about this out there. 

The only consistency over the last five years has been her refusal to see a dr. What was once  angry denial is now an inability to even see a problem. Still don’t see a way until the inevitable crisis happens. 

Thanks.","It sounds like delusional parasitosis. Perhaps you could suggest to her going to the doctor to treat the 'bites' and call the doctor in advance to explain the real issue.
You really need to get her to a doctor. It could be a delerium that's treatable. Make up some excuse about needing to have physicals for insurance or something. Give the doctor's office a heads up about why you're coming in so she can be evaluated properly.
My grandmother has it gotten into her head that there are ticks on her - only two times so far (obviously mentioned about 100 times but only 2 separate tick incidents), but it seems somewhat similar. She has me look at the ""mark"" but honestly, it could be from kind of scratching at it vs. actually a bite. It's not frequent, so I just humor her, as there are bigger issues at hand, but it can definitely get annoying to ""look on the ground for a huge tick"" when there assuredly is not one.

The others' advice is pretty solid about getting her to an appointment. I also find more success in framing visits as required check-ups rather than for a specific purpose (and as I mentioned in another post, I bribe her with ""let's go grab some lunch while we're out!"" when I do get her out for an appointment, to make it something special and enjoyable).
I made an appt with our Doc for hubs stomach issues. But had logged into the Portal for the practice and asked for a baseline assessment for Dementia. The nurse did that and said it was part of the practice nowadays for all patients. Hubs almost walked out, and was furious. But......30 min later after discussing and creating more options/tests for his stomach issues, the Doc sat down in front of him and said he's in the beginning stages of dementia. 

Now there is an elephant in the house.
What happens if you say, “oh that sucks. Let’s put calamine on them” and then lather up the invisible bites with lotion. 

Will that help her? And the pink remains visible so if she notices it she may think about not scratching…. Or maybe she’ll wonder why they’re pink and get off on that tangent? 

Just an idea. The endless attempts at problem solving is such an exhausting part of being caregiver.
Any dry skin issues?
There are doctors that can come to your house. Maybe that’s an option. Wishing her well.
Could she have bed bugs? Scabies?

Dementia,I hate it,"I would like to apologize for my english before I begin, but I need to talk somewhere.
  My grandfather is believed to be in the last stage of dementia. It's so incredibly hard to see him like this. To see him as a shell of who he used to be, to see him hurting so much. I know he's tired, so very tired. He just doesn't want to try anymore. It pains me to see him like this. 
  Lately while I've been monitoring him, he's frightened by me. He tries to attack me, and swing punches at me. He cries, and refuses to eat or drink. 2 days ago we took him to the ER and his doctors flat out told me, ""This is it."" Said we could make him comfortable at home, put him on meds, and let him go. My family has agreed to this, but he doesn't want this.
  I get scared when he stares off. I'm afraid that he's gone. He doesn't want to be alive anymore, because he can't even remember what there is to live for.  I feel like he's already gone, that he's left a long time ago. He doesn't want to be kept alive. 
  I'm afraid that when I wake up, he'll be here no more. I just wish he could be happy.","I'm sorry.  This is such a miserable disease that gives the caregivers no good options for their suffering loved one.  I wish I could offer more than virtual sympathy and hugs.
I'm so sorry you and your family are going though all this.  

To avoid frightening or startling your grandad, loudly greet him ""Hi Gramps!  It's me, Sharkthrowaway."" And wait.  It make take him a few moments to realize you're not your parent, or his parent, or his sibling, etc.  If he's still not recognizing you, say ""I'm <insert grandma's name>'s grandchild."" He may recognize your grandma's name and note the connection.  Don't be afraid to repeat things.  ""I'm your grandchild and I'm here to spend some time with you because I love you.""

As to putting him on pallative care (which what the doc is suggesting), it might be best to have a family meeting (without grandpa) about it so you all can reach consensus.  If even one family member is feeling like ""you guys are killing grandpa!"" it won't go well.  As to grandpa, he won't notice the difference between his regular care and pallative care.  As he's already not interested in eating and drinking, he's starting on the way.

As to remembering what there is to live for, make up a photo album with pictures of your grandparents as young people with their friends and family.  If you have videos, all the better.  You can sit with him and the album, and see if he recognizes anyone.  Does he have a favorite movie or musician?  That can really brighten his day just to have something familiar playing.

It's really hard for all of us watching loved ones go through this.  It's hard for me, and I'm much, much older than you are.  Please take good care of yourself, rely on the support of friends and family, and get grief counseling if possible.    

Your English is great!
I'm sorry. I just heard from my slblings that the nursing home has suggested we put my father on 'comfort care'. After watching my dad's decline for so long none of us have the heart to argue. (And if we did, my dad might be around for longer, but I just can't imagine it would be any happy times).  

Maybe this is a bad story to share, but.... Ages ago I had cat that had gotten feeble. We took him to the vet, and the vet told us that there wasn't anything specific wrong, he was just old, and all we could do was try to get him hydrated and eating more, ""....and come to think of it, that's what we're doing for my father-in-law now."" I keep thinking about that as I've watched relatives go through a general decline. Dementia is worse, but there's not much more to be done for it.
Sorry to hear you are having such a hard time (your English is very good, by the way).
I am sorry for what you're going through. It must be really tough. When a loved one has dementia, grief for the other family members begins long before a person passes away because physically, they're with you but their mind isn't. They are no longer themselves and don't understand things.",2022-02-17 10:43:40,sharkthrowaway777,surs3a
Dementia,Brother charging to care for mum - is it legal or ethical,"My brother and I have verbally split the duties to care for my mum who has moderate dementia. She still lives at home. I have Power of Attorney and manage the bills, investments, accounts, tax, house maintenance projects, invoicing, all dog care and stakeholder comms (cleaner, gardener, daily visiting nurse) etc. I live three hours away. My brother's wife visits once a week to deliver shopping and takes mum to dentist, hair appointments. My brother does NOTHING apart from eagerly awaiting his inheritance. The issue is this: my mum's nurse had to take three weeks' off for an operation. My brother said his wife (my mum's daughter-in-law) would pop in everyday but would charge £500 a week. He told me it was NON NEGOTIABLE - I was in a hole so I had to agree and she has been invoicing me. His wife comes in an hour a day tops and does minimal duties. Basic food and shopping. Her invoice suggests she comes in four hours a day so the hourly rate becomes acceptable. Otherwise it would be 7 hours / £500 = £70 a hour which is laughable. As Power of Attorney I am paying the sum from mum's bank account but with great sadness. I find the whole thing totally unethical and greedy, particularly as my brother will benefit from a substantial sum in the will. I think my mum would be heartbroken if she realised his plan. My brother is wealthy and has a very senior professional job. Any ideas, is this legal, should a daughter-in-law be paid for attending an elderly relative. I am very sad and disappointed....","This sounds like a really complex situation and one that raises numerous logistical and ethical questions. Firstly, as PoA, you clearly want to have your mum’s best interests at heart and state yourself that you do not think this set-up would reflect her issues. Secondly, surely the care provided by your brother/S-I-L is not comparable to that of a qualified nurse and so the remuneration should at least reflect that? I think you need help in mediating this situation. What country are you in? The UK?
It's unfortunate, but you have the power of the purse, they do not. 

Can visiting nurses that can fill the gap?
To play devil's advocate here...

Don't underestimate how much time it takes to do minimal duties.  It's not clear from your post if you know for sure that your SIL is only there for an hour a day, or if you're assuming that from how long those simple tasks *should* take.  For example, it's taken me nearly two hours this morning to coax my dad through having a shower and getting dressed.  We haven't even started on breakfast yet.
It may be legal but it's not ethical.  I'd make a list of backup caregivers you can call on in the future.  Mixing family and money rarely turns out well.
It’s up to you whether to “hire” them or not. If you hired a professional that was only working 1 hour instead of the 4 you were paying her for, what would you do? If you can pay the same amount or less to someone that will do a better job in caring for your Mum, then why not do it? This is your responsibility as POA and probably the reason you were named POA and not your brother or sister-in-law.
I would immediately start looking for a fill in nurse or caregiver that will give better care. Hire them and cut your brother and sister in law loose.  They are milking the situation for money.
Hire a nurse. Or cut her pay to the rate charged by a nursing company. She shouldn’t be gouging. I paid my sister 1/2 the going rate and she felt guilty for taking the money.
> I live three hours away. My brother's wife visits once a week to deliver shopping and takes mum to dentist, hair appointments.

So your sister-in-law helps your mum every week of the year, and you're unsure whether paying for that (and more) for three weeks out of 49 is ethical?

Not sure why you're so focussed on inheritance, when it's your mum's dad-to-day care I would be thinking about now. It's good to think about the finances (which you obviously are well-equipped to do), but your brother and his wife have weekly face-to-face access and (from your post) you manage the books. I think your comment ""My brother does NOTHING apart from eagerly awaiting his inheritance."" maybe unfair, although obviously I don't know you I do know what it's like to have regular contact with relatives with dementia.",2022-02-17 05:27:06,AdDifficult7996,sulnvr
Dementia,"Dysphagia, problems with vomiting up food","Is this a common thing you all have encountered? My family member says foods she once liked now taste like garbage or she chews and chews til she realizes she just can't swallow, usually things like bread. She can often eat a burger patty but she takes off the bun because she has to chew for so long. Sometimes she will throw up while eating if, according to her, she eats one bite too many. No doctors can figure out what is causing her nausea and gagging (she isn't choking on food, as far as I can tell) but I'm wondering if perhaps the dementia has begun affecting the part of her brain that controls gag reflex or stomach upset.

She takes anti nausea pills and says they help but like I said, it's not always vomiting but just not being able to swallow foods she chews forever and spits back out. And the drastic change in taste. She basically doesn't like any food she once liked anymore so it's getting really hard to find things she will and can eat besides boost drinks.

Any experience with this or advice you can share with me?","[deleted]
Does this person now have or.did they have covid? Taste can take awhile to come back

Dementia,I have no idea what I'm doing.,"My mom has dementia. I have no idea what I am doing. She had a doctor's appointment last week and she was having a very clear day, and through the doctor talking to her, they decided that for her to be her safest, she should look into an assisted living facility. We have a couple of really nice senior communities around my area. But I have no idea what I'm doing. What questions should I ask them? What things should I look out for? My coworker said I'll probably need power of attorney, but I don't know what that is, or what needs to be done to get that, or if I need it. I have ADHD and anxiety, so this is all super overwhelming. I don't have any family to get advice from, it's just me and my mom. She has really good days, but her bad days are very scary, and she has been getting a lot worse very quickly. If more background info on her is needed for advice, I can provide any additional details. We've had a pretty rocky relationship, but I just want to show up for her now, and sort my own feelings out later. I really appreciate any advice that can be given.","You and your mom need to work with a lawyer who specializes in elder care. The lawyer can walk you and your moms through the legal needs such as POA, will, living will, etc.
I’m so sorry you and your mother are going through this. Power of attorney give you the authority to make decisions on your mother’s behalf when she is no longer capable of making sound decisions. You probably need one for medical and one for financial. They are important to get as early as you can, while she can still rationally give consent. 

It seems overwhelming, but if you break it down to a series of small steps, you can get through it. 
1. Find an attorney. If your mom has one, start there. If not, get a recommendation from a friend or her doctor, or go to the internet/Yelp.com. You are looking for a lawyer that does estate planning and or elder issues.
2. Talk with your mom about signing power of attorney in case anything comes up while she is in assisted living (this maybe an easier reason for her to accept)
3. Meet with the attorney and get papers drawn up.
4. Have your mom sign (in front of a notary public)

As for assisted living, google them, look for reviews (like Yelp). Tour, look for cleanliness, attitude of staff, general vibe. I have not done this myself, so I would also google questions to ask.

Others can probably give you more guidance.

You are stronger than you know. Hang in there.
I'm working on trying to place both my parents, and working with caring.com. They've been helpful on figuring out finances and setting up tours.
This is a lot for sure - we were thrown into caring for my FIL after my MIL passed very suddenly in 2020.

I agree with others on the attorney for sure - they know a lot and can help you. The power of attorney is a MUST you can notarize one without an attorney but they can help you make sure everything is right.

Take her to her bank and get you added to her account/s. If she gets social security, call them and get through the process to have you as a contact so you can add yourself as designated payee. 

Basically go through everything she has and get you added to it. It'll be easier since she's cognizant so can help give permissions. Good luck, just start making your way through things. It's a LOT so I had a huge master list.
Contact your local Area Agency on Aging - they can help you with all of that.",2022-02-17 00:29:13,cptnhamsalad,suh07u
Dementia,Mom has been moved.,"So if you read my first post about my mother being put in the ICU [Mom is in the ICU. : dementia (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/smb4l4/mom_is_in_the_icu/) here is an update.  

She recovered enough physically that she has been discharged from the hospital and has been moved to a rehab center.  However, her infection seems to have accelerated her mental deterioration.  She is convinced that everyone is lying to her about what day it is because she can't remember Monday.  She insists that yesterday was Monday and today is Tuesday and she doesn't understand why we don't want to tell her what day it is.  My sister told me that this morning while she was visiting her, Mom was convinced that someone had kidnapped her.  

It's not looking like she will come home.  Unless there is a miraculous recovery, she will probably move to a nursing home when she is done at the rehab center.  Part of me thinks that might be what is best and part of me feels guilty for not being 100% in favor of her coming home.  

Dementia sucks.","It's so difficult. Often they need more care than we can give them. We can't be with them 100% of the time with 100% attention and with 100% perfect medical skills the way a team of people can be.

I ask her to please drink her water because the doctor said she needs to and it's a fight. ""I drink tons of water, the doctor doesn't know!"" but she doesn't unless I give it to her

I ask her to please put her feet up (her ankles and feet swell up a lot) and it's a fight.  ""You don't see how much I do put my feet up!"" but she doesn't really ever do it unless I ask. 

I ask her to go back to bed at 2:30am because it's the middle of the night and it's a fight. ""I'm not tired!"" but she does go back to sleep once I can get her into bed.

I tell her that she absolutely must take her meds and it's a fight. ""I never take pills!"" but she takes them every day

You're making the right moves with the attorney. Stay the course and remember that there are brighter skies ahead. I had to do with with my mother and it was really hard. Like crazy hard. But she's much calmer now that she's in a controlled environment (Memory Care Facility) and my father and I can breathe again. So sorry you're in this spot.
My grandma is the same. Some days she’s great. Helpful, keeps to herself for the day. 

Some days she’s a downright demon sent from hell. She puts us in a lot of moral dilemmas especially when it comes to her cats. As bad as it is I kinda of just say “….fuck it” nothing I can say or do will ever stray her or make her understand. If it’s bad for her or just something she shouldn’t do then oh well. It’s not worth the mental Olympics she puts us through.
It’s exhausting.  My mother has been terrible at drinking water.  So many excuses- “I used to be a nurse and I NEVER drank at work!”- and in the earlier stages of dementia that’s all I heard when I tried to make her drink especially since she has limited kidney function.

I felt like a terrible caregiver.  Keeping someone hydrated is the most basic of care tasks and I couldn’t manage to get my mom to drink.  The nephrologist’s advice I’ll share with you-

You can only do so much.  Dementia affects the parts of the brain that get the signals for hunger and thirst.  My mom wasn’t feeling thirst as she should, the doctor said.  Don’t force her, he added kindly.  

You are doing your best in a very difficult situation.    It’s okay to not do perfect care- it’s important that you take care of yourself because it’s easy to burn out.  I’m so sorry you are dealing with this.
Ugh. I feel you. You’re not alone in this
You’re doing the best you can in such a shitty situation. This disease is so frustrating and annoying and any human can only handle so much. Moving her might be what’s best for both of you and that’s ok. She probably wouldn’t want this for you if she still had the capacity to understand reality.
I’m so sorry you are going through this but everyone here supports you, Lord knows it is not easy. 

My mother’s mental faculties took a sudden turn before we could get the POA in place now it’s a sh*t show. She is literally in need of medical assistance and refuses so we are forced to witness her decline. ATM I’m hoping the ambulance will get here b4 she changes her mind again. Already went through this twice in 12hrs…

I’m not feeling too loving rn, too depleted, frustrated and tired….

Don’t beat yourself up - we all do our best but are human….
Been there. You're doing the best you can in a tough situation. Vent all you need to.
I've been there and I know how you feel. It's horrible. Sending lots of love and support your way. ❤️
I feel you.  My mom was the same way.  She had a UTI and refused to take the antibiotics that were prescribed because she ""doesn't take medications"".  She was living like a hoarder in her apartment and got mad at us for trying to help her clean it up.  Our dad died over 13 years ago, and she yelled at my brother and I that we never helped her - yet I would sit with him for 2 hours during the day and my SIL would come on the weekends and sit with him while my mother went to work full time.  When she was finally admitted to a nursing home, she would call and yell at me every other day about what a terrible daughter I am.  I'm so sorry - it's awful, I know.
""I'm exhausted and I hate myself for it.""

Then it is well past the time to put her in a facility. Her level of care is beyond what you are able to give.
Ikr, I hear ya!   ggrrrrrr - so tiring and tiresome.
I know how you feel. My mother was always difficult and is now so much worse. Angry, bitter, selfish... She often says I don't do anything for her and she can look after herself as she now lives in an imaginary world. I too sometimes snap and shout. I have tried walking away but is doesn't always work. You are human, not a machine. Snap when you need to snap but look after yourself and your own mental health. Don't feel guilty! It will end, I want mine to end. Its the truth and if our mothers' were well, they might want it to end too. Big hug x x
just a big, compassionate hug to you. you are allowed to feel this way ♥️ be nice and gentle with yourself please. and know you are not alone! also pleeeeaaase don’t hate yourself! your mum is so lucky to have you. i know how ashamed i can feel when i snapped at my mum - but we are just human beings and doing the best we can!
Not alone with those struggles and emotions friend. 

This disease is so horrible that during the hight of covid, i caught myself a few times thinking her getting covid and not making it would be better than this long drawn out hell.
At the moment I feel that I could just yell at my husband forever.  It it is so frustrating and has taken over my life.............so, I get it. One little, tiny step at a time and we just hold on for dear life. It is a struggle, you are doing the very best that you can under these awful circumstances.
I'm just starting with my mom, Boy what I got coming.  Thank you for this message, I'm in tears. You got this..
Thank you for the words of support and the awards!
You’re making all the right moves. The situation only gives you options which are BAD and WORSE.
My mother in law fell twice today. I am now having to carry her out of the bed to the bathroom or to sit in a chair. I woke up at 1:30 this morning and couldn’t go back to bed. Today was the turning point for us. We ask the social worker to help us and find placement for her somewhere. It was a tough decision to make but I believe it was for the best. We can’t provide the care she needs anymore. If you think you are at the same point that you can’t take it anymore don’t feel shame about it. You did and you do a lot for her already. Want her to go to a facility where she will receive proper care is not something to be shame of. You are also thinking about the quality of care she is/will get. As a caregiver, I know my limitations.
I feel you. I constantly lose my patience with my mother. Oh and the mocking thing along with “don’t treat me like I’m stupid.” EXHAUSTING!!!!
Anyone who’s actually taken care of their relative with dementia knows exactly what you’re going through. As much as you love them, it’s miserable. So bad. Have as much compassion as you can for them and yourself. This is hard. My mother died last august and I’m still pretty traumatized from taking care of her. It’s the most difficult thing I’ve ever been through. I’ve raised children, divorced, and took care of my father while he was dying of cancer. Dementia was by far the worst.
I had to give my dad the “drink more water or you’ll end up in the hospital again” speech for the hundredth time today. It’s exhausting. Big hugs!
I cried reading this, I think this really resonates with a lot of us. Thank you for sharing it, I know it's hard to a lot of the time with other people who have not gone through this experience. We're here for you.

Dementia,Early onset?,"My wife is 38. For the last few years, I have noticed she sometimes will switch words. For example, instead of saying to our daughter “go drain the bathtub,” she might say “go drain the sink.” It happens about once a day, and is noticeable because sometimes it’s hard to figure out what she’s talking about. (“What do you mean, drain the sink, there isn’t any water in it?”)

I have been mildly concerned. But She wasn’t concerned until today. Today, she somehow got times mixed up, put on her coat, and left work an hour early. She said she made two other “dumb mistakes” at work today, but doesn’t want to talk about them. 

It was concerning enough to her that she called a neurologist for an evaluation.

Are these things alone enough to merit concern for some sort of early onset dementia? Or are we getting carried away?","I think it’s great that she is willing to follow up on it. I wouldn’t necessarily jump to assuming it is dementia, but it is a possibility. It could be all sorts of things, some easily checked with bloodwork or urinalysis. Follow through with the process. She may get a diagnosis of depression or stress. These are also possible. Most importantly, keep an eye out for worsening or continued instances. My husband was first diagnosed with depression, which honestly made some sense. However, over the next two years, I saw worsening. He was 49 or 50 when I first started noticing minor changes, 51 when he was told it was depression, and 53 when he was told it was mild cognitive impairment of the frontotemporal lobes. He is now 55.


Also, this is a great time to get your financial health in order just in case your wife has difficulties working. Pay off any debt ASAP, get that house paid for and  focus more on retirement savings. If you find out it is something debilitating, see a lawyer who specializes in elder law to make sure you are covering all your legal bases and also protecting your assets to ensure you can get the care she will need and still have funds left to cover the care you will need someday.
Thanks so much to everyone so far for their insights. It’s really useful to keep us from catastrophizing. She is an exhausted mom of a 5 and a 3 year old (one special needs), works full time, and of course… [gestures at everything]. It’s useful to hear that you all think that these kinds of stressors and fatigue could lead to these sorts of issues. Not to mention hormones, peri-menopause, and other not so terrible things.

She’s still going to see that neurologist I think. But your comments will keep us from spinning in the mean time.
I think going to the doctor will allow you both to take a look at what's going on. Dementia? Maybe but....probably not.  Working full-time, having a kid, etc....making mistakes is normal. Is she getting a solid 8 hrs of sleep on a regular basis? Often a chronic bad sleep habit can cause this. 

Fingers crossed that it's nothing serious.
Following up with a doctor is wise.  Be aware that perimenopause can cause symptoms like this as well as can anxiety.  Dementia is possible but unlikely.
Its possible its dementia,but it could be other medical issues as well. Glad that she is being on top of it though
Good to be tested. Low thyroid unchecked can look like dementia, and is reversible. 
That said, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is an early onset dementia that can manifest in younger people(typically 50s). It first shows up as language difficulties, word finding or mixing up sounds, etc. There are different variants: semantic, logopenic, and behavioral.

Hopefully at 38 it is something more routine and treatable.
She should get her hormone levels checked as well- especially estrogen.
I think the term is semantic paraphasia and I only know that because I looked it up because I do it alot too. I think it gets worse for me when I’m under stress that I don’t really recognize or subconsciously am ignoring but I’ve never gone to work early!  I’m interested in what kind of workup you get so I hope you come back and share. I do hope it is nothing bad!

I do agree with the other poster that it is always a good thing to get your financial and legal documents in order. Even if it’s nothing, do it now when you have a reason too so you don’t have to worry about it when it is too late.

Edit: I just want to add that I was told this can be normal, basically like a brain fart. But to seek further evaluation if it becomes more problematic than humorous. So it sounds like you all are making the right moves with the neurologist evaluation.
I was doing this a lot for a while after our son was born and wasn’t sleeping through the night and working full time. It has massively improved since he has gotten older and I get enough sleep and have a little more time for self care. Still see a doctor to be safe but it could be exhaustion.
I started experiencing this as well after my kids were born 11 years ago. So far it has not progressed into dementia though I do worry about it because I have a strong family history of it, including early-onset. It is noticeably worse when I am stressed. If your wife has any kind of anxiety disorder or executive dysfunction it could stem from that. Poblems with speech and planning are common but underrecognized symptoms
Whatever it happens to be, and hopefully just stress, my biggest piece of advise is to make sure you advocate for her. When we were taking my mom to doctors in the beginning her speech was the biggest problem early on and they would ask her questions where she would give a one or two word answer and they wouldn’t see her struggle. We really needed to be there to say no this is real. I think sometimes when the problem isn’t staring the doctor in the face, especially when someone is young and otherwise healthy, they can write it off as someone being dramatic. I’ve been told it can usually take up to 7 years for a dementia diagnosis because it’s not always so cut and dry as I got lost and I don’t remember. So hopefully it’s something small but it sounds like you’re already doing what you can just keep it going :)",2022-02-16 20:08:57,Einsteinstongue,subty9
Dementia,We decided it was time,"I care for my grandma with vascular dementia. 4 years now I've been helping her. Gradual at first. Driving her places, taking her shopping, helping get her to appointments and bible studies. Then she started her decline. Helping to bathe, doing her laundry, getting her dressed, and now even toileting. I've read plenty of stories and heard everyone who said ""We wished they went into a home sooner."" And I think we are to that point. She still likes being social but we don't live in a neighborhood. She goes to a senior day center that she calls ""school"". After more decline and now issues with eating, breathing, and aspirating- I've decided I'm done. I want to enjoy time with her and not dread it. She takes her anger out on me. 4 years she has been threatening to throw me out. Tried to physically fight me on occasion. And last month she told me she wanted to stab me. No idea why. I was cooking dinner and something set her off. 20 mins later she'll be calm and have forgotten the whole episode. But it'll take me days to come down from my hurt and anger that she treats me like this when she is supposed to love me. So I told my Mom (her daughter) that it's time. We would all be happier and feel more free if she was in a facility. We all currently live together as a multigenerational family. But we have dementia, autism, and PTSD all under one roof too. Everything revolves around her and who can watch her, where we can take her, if we need to leave because of her. It has gotten overwhelming.

I also think we are going to refer to it as ""boarding school"" since she likes ""school"" so much. And once we decide on one or 2- take her to tour and see what she thinks. Then she can finish her time at the current school out and graduate to the new school. I don't know if any one has used this line of thought. But we are going to try it.","I know it's hard, but never take it personally...it is NOT them, it is the disease. They are not in their ""normal"" and ""rational"" mind when these happen. Most times when this is happening, they may not even recognize where they are or who you are. And they will not remember it later. Dementia can change people's personalities so much.

With that said...you do what YOU need to do, for both of you. You cannot give her the best care if you are worn down yourself. And you are NOT a professional medical person...so sometimes they decline to a point that is past what you are capable of. And it is ok for you to admit that you can no longer handle what she needs.

If this were all easy and sunshine...there would be NO market for nursing homes and/or HHAs. And caregiving is not for everyone, especially when they need more specialized medical care.

With her going to a place that can care for all her needs...including medical...you can get yourself back to being you. And you can go visit her, and make good memories. :)
Sounds like a great idea, I will use something similar eventually
I say this with absolutely zero judgement, but be prepared for a cognitive decline when she moves in. Sometimes it can be quite bad. Moves are very hard for dementia sufferers
Wow I could have written this myself. I’ve been on the same journey. Even down to my grandma calling the senior center school. Dementia patients maybe more cognizant than we realize. Just explain to her the situation and be honest about the transition. It’s not a right or wrong decision but totally necessary. Best of luck to you I know what you’re going through is very challenging.
Great idea. In my grandmother’s case, she would agree to a move and change her mind the very next day. In our case, we had to use a bit more trickery for the initial move, but in subsequent moves she’s really surprised me and just got in my car and then walked right into the facility and to her new room. Best of luck to you and your family.",2022-02-16 17:31:44,garden_bug,su8dox
Dementia,"Credit ruined due to Dementia, what options do we have?","Background: I am the caretaker of my friend C, a 78 year old man with Dementia. I am very close with and work alongside his bio son who is power of attorney and between us, we handle C's life for him. 

About two years ago we went through all of C's credit cards and shut them down, or so we thought.  There were about two cards that we did not know existed and subsequently missed paying them off and shutting them down. The initial charges were small, about $100, but the late fees really piled on.

These cards over the past two years have substantially destroyed C's credit. We are worried that this destroyed credit will ruin his availability to get in to a nursing home of his choosing, which is a scenario that is approaching quickly. Do we have any availability to challenge these credit damages, on the grounds that C's Dementia has taken away his comprehension? How does this work? Do we have any options to get back his previously stellar credit score?","From what I have gathered, nursing homes are more concerned with assets than the ability to go into debt.
I've filled out applications for my grandmother for both skilled nursing and memory care. They do not care about the resident's credit score, only their assets and ability to pay. I wouldn't worry about his credit scores, but good job cancelling the cards. His son should also freeze his credit to prevent any further accounts being opened.
Credit scores are used to assess risk when taking out loans. Unless there is some sort of situation where they get something akin to a mortgage, credit scores should not be relevant to the process. If they were looking at assisted living, which sometimes has rental agreements similar to a standard apartment lease that might play a role. But nursing homes don't tend to work like that in my experience.
Check with an Elder care lawyer.
I advise you to post this question also in r/personalfinance . A lot of knowledgeable people there.",2022-02-16 16:57:26,Madsterrr,su7l98
Dementia,I hate dementia,"Over the years I have watched Dementia slowly change my grandmother. 
Right before Christmas the final stage started as well as a severe drop in her kidney functioning. Those two combined (End Stage Dementia and going into kidney failure) and overnight it seems the person I once knew was gone.  The changes were noticeable enough. I knew it was coming but no amount of reading up on things and knowing what to expect can honestly prepare you for the moment when the scales truly tip.
 Nights like tonight. When I can't calm her down. When I can't reassure her that she's OK she's safe she doesn't have anything to worry about , are the hardest. 
     How do you comfort someone who doesn't even know who you are? They don't trust you because they don't know you.  Or even worse they think you are someone who has actually done them wrong in the past. 
   They don't believe anything you say because the reality they are living in is all their own. They are stuck in the worry and anxiety they have created for themselves simply because they have lost their grip on the true reality of things and there's no way to show them anything different. No matter how hard you try. You can't convince them of anything. There's no reasoning there's no explaining there's nothing. 
So you turn to medicine but they won't take it. Because they don't trust you. They know something is wrong. Something is off but it's not them (to them) so it must be you. The only person here. The person here 24hrs a day 7 days a week taking care of them as if they were a 6 month old baby. Bathing feeding changing walking them through every day tasks like it's their 1st time experiencing it. 
OK... 
 So you call the hospice nurse and they send someone out at 1:30 in the morning with a cream form of the medicine. Just rub it in like lotion on the wrist. Ok got it. Let's hope it works. She needs to sleep. I need to sleep. But let's be real even if I get sleep it's not good sleep. Oh well at least it's something. We will go with that.  
      Good days and bad days. And then the bad days start out numbering the good days. And it sucks. 
It's cruel. Dementia is cruel. To the person experiencing it and the people trying to care for the person with it. Especially when it's a family member. I hate it.
It crushes me. But this isn't a battle you win. So you do your best to just roll with the punches until it's over. It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to deal with. 
     I'm trying to stay strong. But nights like this all I can feel is sadness. 
 All I can do is hope  that tomorrow will be one of the good days.","[deleted]
I am so sorry you are going through this. I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. You'll be in my thoughts and I stand with you in hoping that tomorrow is a good day as well. Do your best to take a little time for you even if it is only just a little bit. My heart really hurts for you.
You are not alone. It sucks. Or rather, it sucked. My mom finally died in December. I’m glad the disease is over but by god do I miss her.

Dementia,Unvaccinated family??,"Now that the hard work of caregiving and finding a placement for him is mostly done, other family members have begun to show up and make plans to visit. It's shocking how we didn't hear from them for months and years, and now here they come. If my daughter hadn't kept him alive during the pandemic and his galloping dementia, they'd have no dad and grandpa to come see.

Okay, I can deal with my feelings about that. But *they are not vaccinated* and are *not reliable about wearing masks*. 

The facility where he lives requires masks and temperature screening when you arrive, but there is no monitoring after that.

Has anyone stood in the way of a family member wanting to visit during the pandemic? My daughter didn't give up her life for 7 months to keep him alive so the thoughtless dumbasses could put his life at risk. He is 83 years old, frail and befuddled. *He* was eager to be vaccinated, and got 3.

I'll have to talk to the lawyer; maybe as POA I have some standing to dictate who can see him. This is literally keeping me awake.","When it comes to visitor restrictions the POA's word is usually final. Typically the reasons are things like history of financial or other forms of abuse or because their presence has caused distress to the resident in the past. If your concern is them not following facility policy for appropriate PPE use then you will most certainly have backing from his unit manager. This will be for his protection as well as the well being of all others whom reside or work there.
Seems as POA you have the right to manage his healthcare decisions...one of which is whether to be exposed to maskless people during a pandemic.  Maybe the staff can help you out if you alert them and ask for a little extra support in ""reminding"" these folks to mask up.

The nurses at my grandma's facility walk around all day and enforce this masking requirement 100% for visitors.  It has to be an N95, which are super tight and uncomfortable (or maybe I have a big head :))  At this time, we also have to wear a face shield.  At one point, we were wearing plastic gowns and gloves.

I will also say that my 100 year old grandma is triple vaxxed and has had covid twice...both times she had very mild, if any symptoms at all.  Even with all the wiping down, reducing times people can come in, using face shields, masks, getting vaccination proof from visitors...they've still had a couple of severe outbreaks whereby more than half the staff and residents come down with it.  Then my grandma is isolated again for long periods.  

We cannot converse with the mask due to her lack of hearing and attention span...so we really haven't had a decent conversation in two years.  It's not what we or my grandma want, but I mask up out of respect for the facility as a whole.  I know my grandma would rather catch covid (which she already has twice anyway) than be isolated for long periods or be prohibited from communicating because she can't see anyone's mouth, but who knows what the other residents' wishes are?  I have to assume they don't want to catch it and do my best to avoid giving it to them...hence the mask.

Hopefully you don't have to go the route of hiring a lawyer, but if this doesn't get through to them, likely nothing will:  *""My daughter didn't give up her life for 7 months to keep him alive so the thoughtless dumbasses could put his life at risk. He is 83 years old, frail and befuddled. He was eager to be vaccinated, and got 3.""* Seriously...you know for a fact he would want everyone to take precautions..so to disrespect that is horrible.  :(  Unlike my grandma who I'm sure is ready for whatever natural causes come her way at this point.
I do think it would be cruel to deny a visit from a family member because you dont like them. Perhaps if possible you could arrange to visit with them at the same time to ensure they wear masks.",2022-02-16 03:20:08,penna4th,stqsmp

Dementia,Hyperchondria and Dementia,"So my dad watched a Netflix movie about an auto-immune disease the other day and has since been fixated on the idea that he has auto-immune and not dementia. It would be lovely if he did, truly, and he's early enough in the degeneration process (mild) that it is possible it may be a misdiagnosis.

&#x200B;

However.

&#x200B;

What I am not okay with is him deciding on his own that he will get a GP to write him a script for prednisone (a corticosteroid) without any diagnostics being run by the specialist (who he will see in May). When he told me he was going to try prednisone, and if a GP wouldn't prescribe it he would get it ""another way,"" all of my alarm bells went off. I then dove down the rabbit hole of what chronic corticosteroid use could do to his brain and guess what? Memory problems (in some cases so bad as to be labelled ""reversible dementia"", but this is a misnomer because it is not always reversible damage) is at the tippy top of the list.

&#x200B;

I can't seem to communicate with him that not only will substance abuse not ever happen in my home, but that odds are very good if he self medicates in this way he runs the risk of accelerating everything he's already fighting against. My dad was a veterinarian for nearly 40 years before retirement so he is clever and knows a lot more about drugs and treatment than a layperson, but he also has a degenerative brain condition.

Dementia,Thankyou to the best dementia community on the planet 💔🙏🏼,"I have sung the wonderfulness of this sub reddit to anyone who’d listen. I don’t know how I would have coped til now without you all. Thank you dear fellow dementia supporters / carers for being the most compassionate non judgemental people.

My mother passed today at 5am. 85 vascular dementia. She stopped eating and developed a serious bedsore. I’ve had a lifelong complicated relationship with her due to her narcissism and physical abuse when I was young. But that woman gave birth to me she’s still my mum / mom

We were not close but I looked after her and made sure she had the best care possible.  I fought off several scammers and managed her complicated estate all the while suffering her vitriol 

And yet  I feel so damn guilty so damn guilty for not visiting her in final days just one more time. I visited her last in December to say my goodbye as she was in palliative care. I held her hand I kissed her told her I loved her. It was a good visit she was cold but not awful.

How do you deal with the guilt of end of life by the bed absence?","I’m so sorry. Do you think you are mourning the loss of your mother as well as the loss of the mother you always hoped you would have? Those last days wouldn’t have given you mother you wanted, so try to release that guilt.  Perhaps I’m way off base here. If so, I apologize.
So sorry, that's hard.  You did very very well, sorting her out.  RIP mamma, rockypowwow I wish you also find peace.    \* hugs \*

Her sufferings and yours have ended.

You rightfully have the right to be relieved.

💪
I think no matter what time you spend you will always wish you had spent more.
I've cared for three loved ones as they died and every single one of them passed shortly after I left.  I felt crippling guilt that I hadn't stayed until a hospice nurse told me that it's very common; as if the person doesn't want to die in front of a loved one.  Whatever the reason, you didn't do anything wrong.  When our loved ones die we must inevitably move on without them as they moved on when *their* parents died.  You gave love and care when many would have walked away and that was an extraordinary gift.  You made her final days better.  You offered grace and redemption to her, now offer it to yourself as well.  Thank you for being part of this community and don't feel that you can't continue to reach out for help here as you travel through the grief process.  The fingers of dementia dig themselves into our lives and we often need support long after our loved ones have found their peace.
Nothing so complicated as taking care of a parent who didn't do a very good job of taking care of you. I wish you peace.
So many times the guilt we feel comes from things we thought we were supposed to be doing but we weren't doing.  In this journey, we often put our care behind that of our loved one's.  While this is appropriate in many circumstances, emotionally, it's not necessarily the way it should be.  We have to take care of ourselves - we are people too and our needs matter too.  In circumstances where you're dealing with an abusive past, I think it's right and appropriate to be sensitive to the needs of the one who suffered the abuse.

All of that is to say that you had your reasons for visiting when you did and for as often or as little as you did.  Not one person is fit to judge your actions or inactions, because we haven't walked your journey.  Don't feel like you ""should've"" done things differently just because that's what someone who hadn't suffered abuse would've done. The paths simply aren't comparable.  Sometimes, being there is just too hard.

If you feel guilt because you wanted to be there but couldn't, that's also not on you. You don't have a crystal ball. You can't know for sure how much time you have left.  Even if you had a good idea of when, you still don't know for sure.  You can only do the best you can with what you have in that moment.  Sometimes we just run on empty and don't have anything left to give.",2022-02-15 22:47:25,rockypowwow,stm3mn
Dementia,how to get my dad treatment,"My dad thinks there's nothing wrong with him, so I don't know where to start. He isn't himself anymore, he has major memory lapses. A couple days ago he said he was with my brother, who hasn't lived in the state in years. We had to call 911 two days ago because he was screaming fuck you and shut up at 1am when no one had been talking too him, I asked who he was screaming at and he told me I was a bitch and I made him this way by waking him up at night. I was in bed until he started screaming, and he was definitely awake because he turned and pointed at me when I came in. This isn't the first time we've called 911, the other times in the past few months he was extremely aggressive and threatening to kill us. This time he was threatening to kill himself if we kept ""pissing him off"" when we weren't talking to him. He'll be fine later and can't remember what he did clearly, unless he's lying which wouldn't make sense because he's never been like this in my life. He's never screamed at me or called me names until he started getting confused. He can't remember the names of things, and sometimes can't even find the words to describe them, and then yells at us for not knowing.

I'm mentally ill already, this is way too much for me to handle. We tried to get him hospitalized when he was threatening to kill himself, but in the emergency room he couldn't understand why they thought he was suicidal. I just can't handle living with him anymore, and I feel bad for it but he was pretty absent and I don't feel like I owe him my life. I can't do this without relapsing, me and my mom aren't capable of taking care of him. I don't want to make him worse, and I don't want to lose all my progress in treatment. 

We have no money, he has no retirement fund and he's still a couple years too young to retire anyways. He needs to get treatment that we can't give him, what do we do? I can't keep calling the police on him every time he wants to kill me or himself","Call Adult Protective Services!
Agree, I would start by calling APS and/or your local community’s senior assistance agency/line. They will be familiar with resources and how to get help in your local area. Best of luck.
It may help if you take videos of your dad's at home behavior. It is very common for dementia patients to behave normally with strangers, until a quite advanced stage. You can even try to see a social services or medical specialist on your own. People working in this field shall be familiar with the situation and even if they are not allowed to make an assessment or prescribe treatment without seeing the patient, they may offer a solution for you.
Just came to support you. I had a similar situation with my dad happen- screaming insults at night (sundowning). He has no idea he has dementia. Adult Protective Services is the way to go.
Not all Adult Protective Services are the same or funded the same in each state. I feel OP has a better chance looking up a local area agency on aging (AAA) to understand their options (what many APS will recommend anyway!). Sounds like may be too young to be considered “old” for aging services but AAA’s are a social services agency in the community that at minimum can get you at least an idea of places you could call or what to do. By places - you want to begin searching future care places for him knowing what will keep you well and able to support him. So many people think they must suffer and take on all the care when there are other options!  But, the most critical thing is getting medical care because the staging of this disease often has a period of hallucinations and behaviors that are overwhelming to families. 

When I say places, there are options like keeping him home with support like going to an adult day program for engagement and activity or do you think he needs assisted living or memory care? He will need to get placed on a state based waiver (and sometimes waitlist) to access funding of such care and support -  but he will need lots of evaluations to determine what levels of supports he needs. 

You need to see if can at least get him into an annual visit for a diagnosis and begin his medical story and chart to help you access care and services. You could call the doctor office you want him to go ahead of time to explain you are working on trying to get your dad convinced to come in to see a doctor and could they call letting him know he’s due for a visit? Often mornings are better than later appointments because their brain disease makes it exhausting (hence the behaviors and mood changes)
You mention he’s too young to retire. I know several instances where people were forced to retire in their 50’s because their dementia was causing them to make mistakes at work. 

You might even try deception to get him to a neurologist. If that’s not possible, alert his PCP that he needs an MMSE and also the nature of his other issues. Then take him there. 

Also, you mentioned the ER wouldn’t keep him because he wasn’t suicidal. The questions are always is he a danger to himself or is he a danger to others? If he’s threatening to kill you, he should be involuntarily committed. Absolutely record him (audio or video) when he is threatening to kill you.
I feel for you. I think you’re getting good advice. 

We just left my stubborn dad (no family in his house) have a crisis and then he couldn’t go back home. Not ideal. Lots of mess to clean up.

Neither of my parents knows/accepts what’s happening to them either. 

It’s hard for me as a mentally ill person to see on the outside because I always knew I was off. I just thought I wasn’t quite human if that makes sense, so I was alone in what was happening to me when I was really sick. Both of my parents have enough self-importance to think the world needs to mold around them and try to change reality to make what they perceive to make sense. So the stove is broken and there are cats running around the church.
Omgosh, so sorry this is happening to you all, it's very tough, and sad.   Along with the other advices here, could you call / contact your area dementia .org / alzheimers .org, they're experienced experts in all aspect memory-loss issues.   So sorry OP, hope you find solutions soon!  Take care, be kind to yourself.   best of luck
This is tough, OP. APS good idea, maybe qualify him for medicaid? Some states let you do this online.
Many residential memory care facilities have census for low income residents 
Try to avoid calling the police whenever possible.",2022-02-15 18:54:04,fizzyzone,sth7re
Dementia,Constant forced breathing driving us insane,"My 78-yr-old mother has a habit of forcibly pushing air out through pursed lips with every breath. Every...single...waking...breath. It is constant and drives us all crazy. Her doctor said it's just a tic and there's nothing we can do about it.  

Has anybody experienced similar? And more importantly, has anyone figured out a coping strategy for her caregivers?  
 
The one positive aspect is that we can always hear where she is, so there's less worry about her wandering off unobserved.","My dad constantly sniffs and blows his noise. He goes through a box of tissue a week. I wear noise canceling earphones. He doesn’t know he’s doing it so we just go with the flow. Dementia is a terrible condition.
With my mom it's humming, saying mmmhmm or ok all the time. She had been rubbing her head a lot. So much that she lost a huge patch of hair. It's finally growing back but now she's moved on to the constant humming lol.
My mom started breathing through her teeth about two years after her diagnosis- vascular dementia. Was unnerving at first- especially when driving- I thought she was bracing for something I wasn’t seeing. I’ve brought it up to her doctors - neuro/primary/pt and none have said a word, literally no comment. I just assume it’s another coping/self-soothing mechanism. I’ll remind her once in a while to relax her jaw and take a belly breath.  She’s also started talking to herself the same way she talks to her cat, it’s like she’s keeping herself company?
I’m laughing because my mother grinds her teeth, it is the most annoying sound ever, I give her chewing gum now for some peace and quiet.
My mother has a different annoyance that gets on our nerves. In the morning is easy to copy and laugh along to, but at night after dealing with it all day it's hard to tolerate. Nothing we have tried has been successful in breaking the habit.
Ours is wheezing. She does not seem to know how to take deep breaths anymore. She has vascular dementia. We actually took her to urgent care because previously she had tested positive for C19 and it seemed to get worse after that. Then she aspirated food one night at dinner (breathing/swallowing seems to be getting harder). The chest x-ray was clear but they said to try to do breathing exercises with her. I just try to block it out when she does it. 

She also makes constant Sssss sounds and a few other letters. Easier to drown out while driving by turning the music up.
When my mom lies down to watch tv which is most of her waking hours her rales is pretty much constant. Rales, from COPD is that sound when your lungs is full of mucus  while exhaling and all she has to do is cough, get up and spit it out. But doesn't, or has to be told to and sometimes she wont. 

Sort of gotten use to it, other times it drives me crazy and have to leave or wear noise cancelling headphones. 

Best of luck.
My dad is very loud. He clears his throat and blows out of his nostrils literally twice per minute (I’ve watched the clock). I’ve tried earplugs, white noise, headphones but nothing works. I don’t know what else to do.
Yes! I call the noise my mum makes 'day snores' as it sounds like snoring when breathing. It drives me nuts and have Googled it many times to see if anyone else had the issue with no luck.

I sympathise completely, but am kind of relieved she isn't the only one and I'm not missing another issue that's going on.",2022-02-15 17:58:46,VociCausam,stfyq1
Dementia,Advice for Drs Appointments,"Today was the 1st time I couldn't get my great uncle to see his Dr. We went into the waiting area and as soon as the nurse called his name, he bolted from me to quickly walk out to the car and refused to go back in. I had to cancel his appointment that he very much needed. I feel like I'm failing him in this way. If anyone who has any tips,advice or suggestions I will appreciate it. Thank you.","I’m so sorry! I’m not sure what type of appt this was, I’m guessing it was important that they see him in person to assess his vitals, etc—so in that regard I’m guessing a telehealth appt would not be an acceptable substitute? I’m acting as my mother’s health care proxy and what I’ve found to be helpful is for me to call ahead of appts and explain her situation so that the medical staff can be allies and not simply treat her as though she doesn’t have cognitive issues. Perhaps for the next appt, instead of keeping your uncle in the waiting room, as soon as you check in someone can escort you & him directly to a medical exam room, which might help prevent him from bolting? I wish I had better advice. Hang in there, the fact that you’re there helping your uncle is amazing and you deserve all the love and support.
I feel you on this; when I can even get my grandmother to a doctor, she then acts like nothing is wrong, making it incredibly difficult to get the proper medication (she has arthritis and so is sometimes in pretty significant pain but tells the doctors she is fine so I get treated a little... sketchily, let's say). Her go-to move is to claim her stomach is upset and so she can't leave the house.

It's incredibly difficult to get my grandma to leave the house, but I have been successful when bribing her with getting lunch afterwards. I'm not sure if there is anything that your great uncle really enjoys from the ""outside world"" but tacking that on to after the appointment might work? I hate to say it, but I kind of treat it as if dealing with children, where they get a piece of candy or ice cream after a doctor's trip or errands :)
Sometimes the doctor would come to the house to see my mum when she was in need of an appointment and I couldn't get her to go? Is that an option? The only other suggestion would be to do a telephone consultation and have them write the prescription for you to pick up and the nearest chemist. This was also something out family doctor would do for us.",2022-02-15 11:42:42,carolinabluebird,st76y4
Dementia,narcicisst with dementia - dealing with anger,"hey you guys. thank you for filling this space with life. i do have a question and would be so thankful for resources / opinions / tips. (english isn’t my first language so sorry in advance for any mistakes.)

so my mum is in an early dementia state. we’re still in the process of finding out what exactly is going on, but that’s not the point here. i‘m starting to inform myself, try to learn how to deal with her in a way that makes it easier for everybody. also try to get my family to go that road with me. i worked in a home for the elderly for a few years and i think i got a good idea of what is helpful: agreeing with her, supporting her, connecting to her world, stuff like that.

the thing is: i got sooo much anger. i love her, but she is a narcicisst (of course resulting from her own family trauma) and everything was always about her. i supported her when her parents died when i was 13. i was always the strong one in our family, the smart one who knew how to resolve things. i can’t seem to get over this and i am sooo angry that now she has a disease that makes everything about her AGAIN. these feelings really get in the way of being there for her and finding adequate ways to cope. i feel so ashamed admitting this. i am in therapy and all, but honestly, i‘m making baby steps on this one. so i thought i‘d ask you guys if maybe some of you experienced this and how you dealt with it. i know many people have complicated relationships with their parents :-) 

thanks in advance and have great day!","I’m dealing with my father who has heavy dementia right now( just put him on the toilet and back to bed for the 30th time tonight and it’s 1 am). He is a retired film director and yeah a total narcissist too which went hand in hand with his career. And it’s hard not to see a lot of his incessant needs as an equally incessant need for endless attention. I am STRUGGLING with it. Trying so hard to be a good son but just feeling like I’m still that little kid being trapped and bossed around by “The Director”. So infuriating!!! Wish I had something more enlightening to say
Sometimes the best thing you can do for both of you is take a step back. If others (home nurse/SNF) are carrying for your mother, that allows you to take some space when you need it. 

Even when family relationships are stellar, it's very hard to be the caretaker instead of the family member. This gets so much more complicated when the family relationships are less good. 

Honestly, what you need is a way to protect your boundaries. They've been crossed so much before, and you will have them crossed again. Try to minimise the amount of times it will happen. Your health comes first.
I honestly can't offer any advice because I dealt with this too and not sure I handled it correctly. My dad could be a total jerk and downright mean and all his life he NEVER made a mistake if anything happened, it was someone else's fault. If he ever pitched a fit and yelled or ran us kids off at holidays, he conveniently ""forgot"", so it was very hard to separate his natural personality from the dementia. People would say 'its the dementia"" and I couldn't help it and would reply ""ummm you've obviously not known him his entire life"" (not proud of that). Luckily his doctor has treated him for many years and knows him. I will say this though, now it's easier to see when it actually is the dementia because you can just ""see"" something in his eyes and it's obvious that he's truly confused. I know it's hard, hang in there and take breaks as often as you can.
I am in the same situation and the only thing that has helped is that my mom (stage 6) has gotten surprisingly nicer with her dementia. She is isn’t the same person she was before, so I don’t have to deal with the old her which always had me triggered. The old her comes out from time to time but she can’t sustain it. What is really sad is that she kept my siblings and I divided, so I am the only one responsible for her and she is living with me and my family. I have been taking care of my mom for a year and I would say most of it was feeling extremely anxious and pissed off. Now I suppose I’ve reached the acceptance phase and I mostly feel sad and exhausted. Still angry that I have to make my life all about her again and have her in my home, especially after making a effort to create boundaries and space from her my entire life. I have no answers or words of wisdom and I wish all of us peace.
Oh man…are you me? No one warns you about the ANGER you feel as a caregiver. And there’s nothing to DO with it, except push it down down down until I explode either at my mom, my spouse or my kid. It’s awful. And yep, my mom is also real narcissistic and dementia makes her forgetful about all the time I have already invested in her earlier today so can’t I sit and keep her company some more? My mom was also SUPER social before her illness, and thanks to the pandemic and her struggles to use her phone or any tech, she’s now very isolated. It’s all a bad mix :( No advice other that YOU ARE NOT ALONE in these feelings, and I am sending you a virtual fist bump.
Hey love, im a nurses aid in a dementia hospice. I also have a (diagnosed) narcissistic parent. If you need any support, a place to vent or questions (I dont have a degree yet but I have some experience) you can always send me a message. Keep your head up and take the emotions as they come. I wish you all the best :)
If yours is anything like mine, dementia is only going to make matters worse. There's nothing wrong with her, it's your fault or someone else's or something else's. She'll lie and manipulate. You sibs may or may not get it.

You will be expected to, and most likely inadvertently comply with falling back into the role you were raised to play.

My sibs very much want me to move to my mother's state, take care of her on their terms. I want her in a retirement home. She's an alcoholic too boot. This is why she doesn't want to go into a retirement home. She's broken her back from a fall, broke her leg from a fall. She's still living alone. She came very close to losing her savings from a scammer. I can't get my sibs to agree that she needs to be in a retirement home. 

In the end, I have decided to step away from the family again. It's not my job to convince them what needs to be done. My mother refuses to see she needs help. But, I should move there. Take care of her. Yeah. No. Mind you, I have 3 other sibs that don't want to take care of her either.

I went no contact with her after she used me to divert attention from the mess she got herself into. My sib called me screaming about my behavior. I hung up on him. They don't see she's manipulating. I'm supposed to turn the cheek. No. 

My mother almost broke me once, and, mistakenly I let her back in. Then she did it again. I went NC again. Then my sib manipulated me into talking to her. Now she's trying to manipulate me and hoover me back again. I'm ignoring her. Does it feel great? No. But, my sanity, my health, and my marriage are of greater importance.
Hi there! I am also finding myself in a caregiving position for a parent (mother) who is a Narcissist and was/is abusive to me, and she has as of yet undiagnosed cognitive issues (she also is temporarily disabled so I’m in hard-core caring mode). I am the only one she has—my only sibling has been estranged for a decade and my mother’s sister wants nothing to do with her. So I am isolated and angry and resentful, as you and many others have already identified in this thread. I’m glad to hear you’ve got a therapist, (I have one too!) as well as specific times that you will spend with your mom. (Unfortunately I’m living w my mom right now but looking for a way out—need to hire caregivers for her and get her dementia professionally diagnosed). 

I just want to tell you that there is nothing wrong with being angry and feeling angry, and you don’t have to feel guilty or ashamed about those feelings. **You have every right to feel angry.** The trick is not about denying or burying the anger, but how you handle it so that it doesn’t hurt you (or anyone else). The fact that you can acknowledge your anger is a fantastic first step. Are there healthy outlets that help you to feel and release your anger? For me, cardio exercise often helps. When I need an immediate release, I go into my car and scream into a pillow until I feel more at peace. I know some friends who find that journaling their feelings—especially anger—can be helpful. Please just know that you are not alone, and your mother is so incredibly fortunate to have you. And your anger is justified! Society tells us that anger is a no-no, especially if we’re female. F that noise. Anger is a legitimate human emotion. It’s all about feeling our ways through it without doing harm. I wish you strength and peace. Feel free to DM me whenever you want. ❤️
My father who was horribly abusive (and incredibly
selfish) my entire life has dementia. I’ve been struggling with similar anger and more recently guilt. I feel guilty that I’m short with him or respond negatively to certain things he does. The dementia has, for now, made him docile and down right compassionate in some cases which makes me feel that much worse.

the DBT workbook by Marsha Linehan has been amazing. There are tips and exercises to help you create space between yourself and the anger you are feeling. It allows you to explore the anger without lashing out or having to suppress it.

Mindfulness, validation of  your emotions, and creating emotional space are all pillars of DBT. While it is generally used for helping manage symptoms of personality disorders it has a proven track record in the mental health world and I can’t recommend it enough.
Have another family members tip in. She will need help. And don’t accept any behavior. Tell her, in a non confrontational way, when she is being obnoxious. It is hard, specially at the beginning, but it does get better (by better I mean the way you deal and coop with her condition). 
But the main thing is get help. Also, consider a institution if it is too hard to manage.
I'm sorry you're going through this. I agree with the advice to rely on others to help you,  if you can.

My narcissistic mother is currently ""caring"" (aka doing the bare minimum to appear she's a good daughter) for my grandma who also has some (untreated) mental illness, anxiety, generally a difficult personality, and now dementia. It's a BAD situation. My mother dramatically tells everyone she will ""off herself before she gets this bad"". I'm thinking, no you won't. You will refuse to see that anything is wrong with you and everything will be everyone else's fault"". She's already showing some very mild signs of dementia, including paranoia and memory problems, but would never admit that.
You are not alone. I have no advice unfortunately, but know that you’re not alone. Give yourself grace.
My mother (non-narcissist) has FTD, and I honestly want to kill her sometimes. I’m her main caregiver, as in I’ve hired care for her, but I’m the daughter she has in town. My sister is across the country, but as helpful as can be, given the distance. 

My father is also local, but is a narcissist, and we are currently no contact. We were NC for 15 months until mom was diagnosed in April 2021, and have renewed NC (my choice this time) since December 2021. If he EVER gets a terminal illness, I’m not doing it. No way. I cannot imagine this experience with narcissism thrown on top. No. I love my stupid dad in spite of myself, but no. My sister can deal with that. 

I’m sorry, OP. Do you have any siblings or family who can take over as primary? There will be guilt, but there’ll be guilt regardless.
I have a similar situation.  If you have other relatives who can step up and help, let them.  Otherwise, hire help and keep yourself out of close caretaking as much as possible.  Don’t be afraid to set boundaries—my mother is quite good at telling me to do things instead of asking.  I say no without guilt.  She is perfectly capable of getting her own cookie or glass of water, and I tell her that.  It’s infuriating that this person, who spent lots of money while I was growing up on herself (as in, lots of foreign travel) and didn’t save for retirement now needs care and expects me to provide it.

Therapy is pretty much the only answer besides Adult Protective Services.  There will be a time in therapy when you realize how much you missed in your childhood and you may feel devastated.  There is a grieving process that is very difficult and painful, but once you have gone through it, it will remove the power this person has to make you feel inadequate and guilty.  Then you can make a more deliberate decision about exactly how much time, money and effort you are willing to spend on this person, and why you are doing it.  You do not owe them—it is a gift you choose to bestow, and in my case the reason is that I would not be able to live with myself otherwise.  That may not be the same conclusion for you.  

I find when she makes yet another nasty remark, I can defuse it for myself by saying (out loud) “Thanks Mom, I love you too,” in a fairly sarcastic manner.  It also usually stops the attack by shocking her that I’m not just buckling under like I used to.

There are no easy answers.  First you need to decide if this is something you’re willing to do (you are not obligated.) Then decide how much you are willing to do, and do not accept manipulation especially the guilt-induction she will try (even when she doesn’t do it consciously.)  Give yourself a break as much as you can.  And hire people to do the bulk of the work and support you if you are able to do that.

FWIW, mine has gotten nicer as the dementia progresses and she realizes on some level just how dependent she is on me.

Edit:  Is adult day care an option?  She might enjoy socializing, and it would keep her busy and away from you.
Hi OP- You have described my situation almost to a T. My mom has always been about herself, her wants, her needs. She loved me as a little girl but once I reached 10 yes old, she stopped talking to me AND WE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE. I thought I did something wrong so I was trying to please my parents any way I could, be it perfect grades, perfect body. If I would get new school clothes, which was rare because we were poor, she would say “what about me?” She didn’t attend my high school graduation, my wedding, birth of my child, my college graduation, nor did she visit me in the hospital when my appendix almost burst. If it was too inconvenient for her she wouldn’t do it. She kicked my brother out of the house because she didn’t want to deal with him. When I found out she had Alzheimer’s I was the only family member around willing to help and that “me me me” attitude never went away even with Alzheimer’s. My husband and I moved her into our house to take care of her, we worked opposite shifts and paid for an aide a couple hours a day to make sure she was not home alone inbetween the time my husband left for work and I got home. I ended up having a mental break down and I had to move my mom to memory care and I still felt guilty about that even though she has never been there for me my whole teen and adult life. I received a call from her one day with her yelling at me saying I stuck her in a nursing home and how can I do that and don’t you love me? All that anger and resentment came out and I finally said mom you never loved me you have never been there for me you didn’t want to be there for me and we barely had a relationship before all this happened. I have sacrificed so much on your behalf and you don’t see that (she was having a lucid moment when she called). I told her this conversation is over and I am getting off this phone and I hung up. I am so tired of feeling misplaced guilt. OP-you’re not alone.
Dementia does not cure a personality disorder.",2022-02-15 03:59:33,uschikotze,ssyoa9
Dementia,My dad's journey ended on Sunday.,"His diagnosis of Vascular Dementia was in January 2018. My eldest son summed it perfectly: ""Pappy is saying a long goodbye."" 

&#x200B;

We were fortunate in that throughout his confusion, dad mainly grasped that while he might not know us, we knew and loved him. We were fortunate that he was able to be cared for in his own home. In the last few months, when dad refused point blank to shower, a great team carers called in every morning & thankfully succeeded in encouraging dad to shower. 

&#x200B;

An infection of the lungs saw him admitted to hospital the first week in January 2022. Four years after the initial diagnosis. The doctors, nurses, therapists, and nursing assistants could not have looked after him better, or tried harder to get him well enough to return home. They were wonderful, and allowed us to visit everyday, 

&#x200B;

My mum, his bride of over sixty years, God bless her, had difficulty coming to terms with his illness. It broke her heart when he couldn't remember her, and insisted he ""had to go home now, to his lovely wife."" It broke our hearts to witness her grief. It's going to be so hard on her. I'm feeling blessed that my siblings, their kids, and my kids are all determined to support her & do what we can to help her feel less alone. 

&#x200B;

It feels so strange. My dad has been our family's rock. Almost to the last, he was saying ""let me know if I can do anything to help."" I loved him so much but accepted he was leaving us. Now he's gone. I thought I had already grieved for our loss, and we had all the opportunities in the world to say a final goodbye, and tell him we loved him, but it still hurts. 

&#x200B;

To all those accompanying a loved one on this traumatic rollercoaster of a journey, I hope you have support in place, either from family or carers, and sincerely hope you take every opportunity to find a few pockets of peace. 

&#x200B;

To the Mods: I hope this is allowed. Also, I want to say how I appreciate this sub, and being able to share experiences, frustration, and grief. Thank you all.","He loved your mom enough to want to hurry home to his lovely wife. I hope she can appreciate that, even if he didn’t realize she was the lovely wife. 💕
I am so sorry for your loss. A long goodbye is definitely the perfect way to say it! My husband, daughter, and dad are all going through our long goodbye with my beautiful mom starting in September of last year. It's nice that you all were able to visit him and spend time during his last days. May your memories of him bring you comfort and happiness always.
Thank you for sharing. I hope you can find peace and some relief. My father also has vascular dementia. He was diagnosed about 10 months ago, but has been declining fast. He’s under hospice care now, but he’s still hanging on … I love him so much and don’t want him to go, but I also don’t want to see him suffer and wish he could die with dignity. Take care. Share stories and keep him alive through those.  Cheers.
So very sorry for your loss. He is now free from the torture and confusion, free to remember him as the person he was before the disease.  May you all find peace and comfort in knowing you did the very best for him.
Thank you for sharing this.
Thank you for your post. I’m sure it will help so many families who find themselves in a similar situation. I’m sorry for your loss, and I was sad to read about your mom’s pain when your dad didn’t recognize her. Hopefully you have a ton of memories to sustain you. Sounds like your dad had a wonderful support system. Sending you hugs during this time of healing.
I'm so sorry. This grief is such a strange and terrible one, complicated by that long goodbye.

Your story has weird parallels to mine. My dad died on Saturday. He was also our rock - the person who gave everything for the family and was the person we could all turn to. With him gone, no one really knows where to turn. But we're trying to stumble forward as best we can.

For you, I hope for peace, acceptance, and love. In the days since my dad died, what's helped me the most has been thinking about what he's left behind. The lessons he taught, the positive marks he left on our lives. He might be gone, but that remains. Likewise, your dad may be gone, but he lives on in your heads, your memories, your habits, and your heart.
I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing ♥️
I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing this post. It really helps me to know that I'm not alone.",2022-02-14 17:51:10,Emergency-Nebula5005,ssne4g

Dementia,MIL Asks the Same Questions Over and Over...and Over,"For background, my 82 yr old MIL has dimentia (I don't know the specific level or formal name). She isn't able to drive, cook, she forgets names, she can't be left alone,etc. She lives 1000 miles away and we haven't been able to spend much time with her over the past few years. 

The past few years have been tough, but the past few months have been extremely challenging for her. She lost her husband two weeks ago and because of her condition we decided to sell her house and move her into a memory care facility. Because we live out of state, living with her is not an option. As I write this it sounds horrible that we haven't included her in the detailed conversation, but she wasn't able to understand and contribute to conversations with her husband and family months ago.

My wife and family quietly packed up part of her house without discussing it with her until the end. They explained that she was moving to a place where she can be cared for and safe. My wife and her flew to our house and told her that she was staying with us for a while. The reality is that we're getting her place at the memory care facility ready for her to move in shortly after her things arrive. 

She only remembers a few pieces of the conversation (s) about moving, and incorrectly remembers the details frequently. She will tell us that someone (she knows it was family but doesn't remember who) came in last week and started packing up the house. Then she said that someone told her that she was moving but she didn't have other details. 

My wife will explain that they packed up their house and they're trying to figure out the best place for her to live. Luckily, she understands that she can't stay in her house alone which is very helpful. 

This conversation happens again and again and again. My MIL brings this up somewhere between once an hour and as frequently used every five minutes. My wife had that conversation 10 times in less than an hour and a half tonight. She also wakes my wife up multiple times per night to have the same conversation. 

How can we either help her understand and remember the plan, or reduce the frequency of having the same conversation? We have been truthful with her about the plan (except that we have decided on moving her to a facility) but she forgets within minutes....not sure what to do from here.","This is dementia. It's probably MIL trying desperately to process all the very sad things she's gone through. Until she's settled where's she's going and begins to come to terms with her new situation. She'll do this dance of talking about it. She'll be missing her old life, in her own home, with her husband. Took my mum about a year to accept her new set up. She's been through it.
So sorry, that's very very sad for your MIL, very traumatic.  And hard for your family.   

I wonder if something like this might help.... 

Make a bereavement photo of her husband, a nice one in a frame with appropriate nice words, black ribbons or whatever is her culture / customs, put on an obvious table/shelf, with some nice nicknack / decoration.   Make another framed one to put/keep next to that, saying clearly - 

RIP MIL husband last month    // 

 MIL will stay here at <OP wife> house for 3 weeks  /// 

MIL belongings coming soon on moving truck  ///

 MIL  will move to lovely new home nearby OP wife house next month  /// 

It's a lovely home, they are preparing it for MIL now   ///

OP wife & family will visit MIL there every week!!  

Everything will be ok, don't worry about it, let's have a nice stay here now.   

&#x200B;

I've found with my mum, when I make notes like this, they help her a lot when something confusing for her is happening, such as - she had to stay in hospital for 2 days & had no idea what was happening -- my brother was coming from far away to visit for a week  -- a brother of my father died -- when covid lock-downs started & she couldn't go out to get newspaper --  etc... 

I don't know what will help your MIL, but something like this might help her, and you all.  At least it should cut down on her asking so many times.   Poor MIL, it must be so confusing.  Best of luck!
Poor thing is having such a hard time understanding what's going on.  I don't think you can prevent the same anxiety-driven questions from arising, but you can change your response.

I think it's important to address the anxiety, then re-direct.  ""All this change is confusing isn't it?  And I'm so sleepy right now, it's all jumbled up in my head.  Can we go over it in the morning and get it all straight?""  or ""It is confusing, but I'm sure we'll get through it if we work together.  Let's start with a cup of coffee."" 

What didn't work for me:

\- Saying ""we've been over this."" or similar frustration-based responses

\- Trying to fix it, either by writing down the plan or explaining it in great detail.

\- Telling her that she can't do something like going back home, driving a car, or getting a job.

So for example when Mom says she wants to get a car so she can go shopping whenever she'd like, I ask her what kind of car, does she need a big car or a small car, etc.  Then I ask her if she'd like to go shopping right now.

It's a huge change for you all, be patient with yourselves and with her.  It will also be stressful when she moves into the facility. She may hallucinate, she may feel she's been kidnapped and imprisoned, she may be angry and resentful towards you and her caregivers.
I found my mum's dementia was worse while she was grieving and trying to understand that my dad would never be back. Here are some of the things that seem to have helped her:

- a tonne of reassurance

- eye contact when speaking to her

- physical reassurance - holding hands, hugs, kisses

- distraction - inviting her to reminisce about her relationship with dad. Reinforcing their love for each other. Looking at old photos. Asking her how they met. Asking her about her childhood. Music, specifically their music from their youth. 

And of course...

- time.

She still looks for my dad every day, but now things are less chaotic, she quickly realises that he's gone.

I always tell her she's not alone, that I'm there for her always and she's loved very much.
Maybe it would help to have a notebook about her move?  You could have pictures of her old place, the new facility (or a similar facility) and places for all of your to keep notes.",2022-02-14 02:05:27,Bcruz75,ss4ies

Oh! Well, happy birthday to your Valentine's Day baby, wherever his next adventure has taken him, sarpon6!

Dementia,93 year old toddler,"Husband worked today, worn out, sleeping in a chair in the living room while I watch the Super Bowl. Mother-in-law toddles in with the art project she made at the senior center. She leans over my husband with the construction paper envelope, explaining to him that it needs to be fixed. He tries to wake up but can't. She takes a couple of steps and aligns herself perfectly between me and the TV screen, mesmerized by the half-time show. She sways and bobs to the beat. She turns around and holds out the paper and asks where the stapler is. I get up, take it from her, find the stapler, affix the name plate that had come loose, give it back to her. She's delighted and takes the envelope, moving off down the hall, talking to -- who knows? -- the universe, I guess -- about how it's fixed now.  Leaves the actual craft behind.

It's so much like living with a three year old that it's creepy. I just wish she enjoyed bath time as much as the kids did at that age.

its sad its lovely its tough
My experiences with my mother in law are almost exactly the same! We say the same thing about bathing too. It’s all different when the person in question weighs 150 pounds instead of 25.
That's lovely!    Apart from the bathing dramas.  

Yes, I get those toddler moments too.  My mum was a primary school (grade school?) teacher all her life, so she loves the craft projects out with her alzhms oldies group.  We put them proudly on the fridge, the mantlepiece.    And preparing to go out somewhere - where's yr hat, where's yr jacket, have you been to the loo, have you got yr house-key for just-in-case.   At least I don't get 'are we there yet?', lol, I get 'but where are we going?'.   She also does that stand-between-me-and-tv-at-crucial-moments thing, lost in the screen.   Bless them.
I have an almost 3 year old. My dad has dementia. They very recently cross intellectual paths. It was weird to observe. They still like watching the same, simple shows though.
My moms hates showers
My 89-year-old MIL is in this same alternate universe. I mostly can handle her behaviors with patience. Other times I’m at the end of my rope and my brain is short-circuiting with frustrated, angry energy. The saddest part to me is that a 2-year-old eventually utilizes what you tell them and grows intellectually as a result. My MIL will only be growing younger.
We call my LO the toddler all the time (in a loving way).  When they came to live with us I texted my friends that I had a 5’3” tall, 110 lb, grey haired, brown eyed baby.  They want to be everywhere we are, loves to have their hand held, resists showers and clothes changing, are wobbly on their feet, but mercifully will eat what ever is in front of them.
This is an adorable story, and I can relate! The kiddish thing my grandma does most is play with her food.  Anything that hangs off the fork a bit gets swung back and forth while she says ""ding dong! Ding dong!"" And giggles.
The yarn heart looks like such a cute activity and I think I'll try it with her too!
I had to deal with my turning into a toddler when i was 19. It friggin devastated me. Shes been gone 16 years and i still have noghtmares with her having dementia

Dementia,Overwhelmed horribly,"So let's set the the table, as my folks used to say.... I(28m) here am completely in over my head and hanging on by a thread.
Here's the timeline. December 28 2021 the man that raised me, my grandfather who was only 55(he married into the family when my mom, his step daughter, was 9) I haven't lived with them in some years now but after his passing I was shutdown for a little while, testing positive for Covid and Flu January 10th doesn't help either. Well, my mom volunteered to take care of my grandmother and my grandfather's lingering affairs(mostly bills as he'd just moved to a new house 2 hours away as opposed to living 20 minutes away) he kept their health to himself and shouldered the burden... well fast forward to 2 Mondays ago my mom decided to decieve me by asking me if I could watch my grandma for 4 hours, I of course agreed since I'd just tested negative, this turned into ""I can't keep her in my house anymore, I just can't deal with the dementia."" Knowing I'm the last close living relative my grandmother has, however I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with my girlfriend(35) and her 2 kids (9, 12). My grandfather's affairs including their house still up in the air, my grandmother's health history up until last Monday on a doctor's appointment was a complete mystery to me. Idk where to start I'm struggling just to get her to shower and eat (she's still completely physically capable)","Your mother asked you to watch your grandmother for 4 hours and never came back to pick her up? And your grandmother is staying with you, your girlfriend and two kids in a 3 bedroom apartment?

A lot depends on what kind of financial resources your grandmother has.  Is there an elder affairs or senior services agency in your area? Have you called them?
[deleted]
Who is your grandmother's POA or legal guardian?  If she doesn't have one, she needs one asap or you won't be able to admit her to a facility and pay the bill or access other help regardless of where she lives. If it's your Mom, is there a named successor? Your Mom has abandoned your grandmother and this is clear grounds to have her removed as POA/guardian.
Omgosh so sorry, this is really hard.   Contact your area dementia .org / alzheimers .org, for additional help with advice, counselling, etc.   They are experienced experts in memory-loss issues, have tons of resources, information, telephone help-lines, etc etc.  I'm down in Australia so I have no idea who you need to contact regarding in-home services / residential options.

Dementia,iPhone?,"My 88yo mother with deteriorating mental functionality can't make calls on her flip-phone.

My sister says, ""We should get her an iPhone!""

I actually burst out laughing when she said that.  My sister also wants us to buy all of my mother's food at Whole Foods, buy all of her clothing at L L Beans, etc.  No expense too high, that my sister isn't paying.

OK, but I'm getting cynical.

Dementia caregivers -- have you had any luck introducing a smart phone to your caregivee?

I know smart phones are intuitive.  I'd be lost without mine; it's my memory, my schedule, my GPS, my contact list, my entertainment, etc etc etc.

But is my mother going to be able to figure out how to ""wake up"" a smart phone, then what to press to find the phone, then what to press to find the right person she wants to reach, then what to press to make the phone call?

What do you think, DCBT?  

(Dementia Caregivers Brain Trust)","Your response of bursting out laughing was the correct one. No way.
My husband has mild cognitive impairment. He’s been using an iPhone for about 14 years now. His MCI is making it hard for him to use his iPhone. He thinks someone has called him and he calls them back. They haven’t called him in months. He sees the old calls on the call log and thinks it’s a new call. And even that old call on the call log was him calling them, not the other way around. He taps weird things on his phone and craziness ensues. I’m constantly having to fix things for him, such as apps zooming in for no reason. Right, sure. He did it, but he doesn’t understand it was him. The iPhone is going to be an even bigger problem when he truly hits dementia levels. Do not, I repeat, do not get your mom an iPhone at this point.

I would instead get her a landline. She will be able to understand that much more easily because it’s like what she had most of her life.
Nope nope nope. (In my experience.)

Even if they’re cognitively intact using a touch screen with dry shaky old lady (aka zombie) fingers is near impossible. Also based on my experience.
Seniors with dementia with smartphones (dare I be this dramatic? Yes, it’s been *that* kind of a day, I dare) are this generations version of seniors with dementia with car keys. 

I almost post here on the daily wanting to ask all you smart and wise people what the fuck I can plan to slowly take my dads smartphone away from him. The daily problems he causes me with it are ever-growing, and never-ending. It’s like wack-a-mole. 

Your sister is literally trying to give your mother a computer with internet access, which goes both ways (meaning, allowing predators to access your mother). Might as well get her a bottle of vodka and hand her some car keys and tell her to have at it.
No. I even tried the “senior friendly” brand but no bueno.
I got my mom a kids gizmo smart watch, it only calls certain numbers and only certain numbers can call so no telemarketers, it's just one swipe to get to contacts and call  and you can set it from your phone app to auto answer when you call.
We got mom an iPhone. She couldn’t even remember to swipe to answer. Within a year we had turned it in for a flip phone. There is no way to teach them new technology and have the information stick
Hell to effing no. My mother used to be able to use her iPhone. No she doesn’t even know if it’s a phone or the remote for the tv is phone. 

At this point it’s just good for when I make
Calls for her and use the old vtech cordless phone with Bluetooth to which it bounces too.
\-the devil's workshop (why get her involved with an iPhone?  where's the need?)
Oh no, I can't even tell you the daily issues I have with my elder and the iphone. A touch screen to most people is second nature but to a fragile mind with no experience with it...a nightmare.
Before someone moves into my memory care, I always tell the families that unless they were using a cell phone daily before, it is not worth it to have one. Much less an iPhone! That will get broken or lost so fast. 
Also, I’d be careful with her having a phone, and give her one that’s incredibly basic. The scary part comes in when scam callers call them and convince them to give their social security number.
GrandPad is very nice! It’s more like a tablet but she can face time with people basically. And only those on her friends list. An admin can keep control of it through an app and they have easy customer service. My husband’s grandmother loves it. She gets pictures of the grandkids sent to her and she can call any family member with the app on their phone.
Nope. Smartphones are intuitive for those of us who grew up with tech. But my 90+ father was a civil engineer and couldn't work his idiot-proof captioning phone for deaf people, much less a smart phone, *without* dementia. Hell, he got lost on simple TV menus.
My dad had a flip phone, then forgot how to use it, then didn’t know what it was. He died from Denton June, he was 90.
Nope on the smart phone. How about one if the drop-in devices in this article:

https://dailycaring.com/best-way-to-make-video-calls-to-seniors-with-alzheimers-or-dementia-in-nursing-homes-during-coronavirus/
Nope.

My dad had a smartphone before he got dementia. As time went on, he stopped being able to use the smartphone--and eventually couldn't even use a remote for the TV. Learning a new piece of technology was absolutely a non-starter.
My Mom is 88 with mid stage dementia. She lost the ability to use her remote control. Forget about a smart phone it will be a total waste of money.
There are phones which have single buttons on them. E.g a,b,c which phone people’s pre programmed numbers in.
I would not get her an iPhone.  We got my mom one of those simple Jitterbug phones and couldn't use that - there's no way she'd be able to use an iPhone.
We just took the phone away because she kept threatening and attempted to call the cops because we took her car keys away.
No, just the opposite.  My wife (in her 60s with dementia) kept locking up her iPhone because she could never remember the code to get into it.  She would also try to make phone calls using the number pad that shows up when you need to enter your pin to unlock the phone.

In my opinion, getting an iPhone would be a waste of money.
Nope. My hubs was just diagnosed at 67 yrs old. He's had an android for years. He gets sooooo frustrated with the damn thing that he flips out and throws it. Nope - don't add to her frustration with this disease.
Technology in general for older generations (circa 75 ish upward)  just seems to be difficult to grasp and comprehend.  I've set up my mums flip phone with single button quick dials for the people she needs to teach, and then given her a laminated set of flip cards with pictures of the actual buttons to press and one liners.  Ie open ph, press and hold 1, when screen shows dialing,  put phone to ear and talk.  She manages that about 80% of the time.

Touch screens really frustrating and I've never succeeded in adjusting the sensitivity settings to make the device so my mum can use them without getting herself in a pickle
Hubby as an IPhone, has always had one.  He is starting to ave difficulties working the phone and complains all the time that it doesn't work right.  I would never give a person with dementia an IPhone.  He thinks he has calls, doesn't understand his notification tones, thinks his messages just get lost, can't send a message......the daily torture goes on and on and at some point I will have to take it away from him..........that will be a fun time!
OMG my husband did all this. He breaks his phone because he tried to jam the charger in backwards. Then he picks a new phone but he keeps turning voice over on or making apps he doesn’t want open. It’s a daily thing. And we can’t talk about it because when I ask him why he does some of the odd and crazy shit he’s doing—he blames me for trying to “start a fight” but I never get an answer about why he separated all the pieces to a blender and put them in 5 different places. Or why everything is on the counters but the cupboards are empty. And we’re just getting started in this journey
I think the nice thing about an iPhone vs a flip is that the icons are bigger and in some cases (depending on the comparison of the flip phone) more descriptive. 

You can always set it up to only have a few apps on it, and make it announce who is calling/texting. 

There are a lot of accessibility settings that can make it very easy to use as well. 

I have found that some with dementia have a hard time transitioning. Keep this in mind and be patient! She may not understand that this is a phone like her flip phone because it looks so different, or try to do flip phone functions on the new phone, etc.",2022-02-13 16:40:53,magnabonzo,srts7b
Dementia,Subscriptions,"How do I make her stop sending away for subscriptions? How can I make the junk mail stop???

She is mildly impaired and loves to send away for subscriptions and anything that says it’s “free to try, send back if dissatisfied”….

I ended up changing his address to mine, sorting through the mail and removing problematic stuff, and delivering the rest to him the next time I visited.  I still can't look my mailman in the face due to all the ""male enhancement"" mail I got for years.
Oh sheesh, was I strangely happy to come across your post, if only for finding another common thread. My mom has somehow gotten on so many junk mail and phone lists for donation requests--it's really unbelievable. Today alone, a stack of 10 -15 donation requests from all sorts of charities, political groups, animal shelters--name it. It's daily. And their land line and her cell phone ring constantly with spam bs. It's so frustrating, but she must have given to a few of something and now they won't stop! 

I'm just beginning the financial cleanup--realizing that things have been spinning out of control behind the scenes without us seeing it. Why didn't we see it?

Dementia,"“Best geriatric doctor in town” prescribed my grandma antipsychotics, and shes getting worse","My 93 year old grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimers nearly a year ago but the last 3 months or so she has been rapidly deteriorating. For a few weeks, she had become very aggressive and was having trouble sleeping. Because of this, her doctor prescribed her antipsychotics. When my mother told me this i was immediately put off. I’m not a doctor, but I work in pharmaceuticals, and I have my own mental health issues as well as friends with psychotic disorders, so I have done extensive research in the field and like to think I know a good amount. These drugs are designed to block dopamine receptors in patients who have overactive or irregular dopamine production in their brain. Alzheimers and dementia have nothing to do with overactive dopamine production, they just prescribe this to sedate aggressive or unpredictable patients. My grandma stopped being aggressive, but it is CLEAR she is experiencing all of the negative side effects of the drug. She is constantly confused and almost never knows who is around her or whats happening, she is always tired and sleeping, and can barely speak anymore. My mother seems to think every time she remembers something, thats the antipsychotics working. I’ve explained to her that the drugs mechanism of action simply CANNOT make her memory better, and if her memory is getting better it is DESPITE the antipsychotics, not due to them. She wont listen to me and refuses to hear anything I have to say, because “doctors are always right.” Im at my wits end and im afraid my grandmother is going to die sooner because of these drugs. Ive even considered calling the doctor and speaking to him directly. What can I do? I would rather have a slightly aggressive grandmother with most of her memories in tact, than a zombified sedated confused grandmother.","I agree with the other responder, that unless you are living with her every day and responsible for 100% of her care, you preference for a ""slightly aggressive"" grandmother over a calm, less anxious, but medicated one really doesn't have a foot to stand on. The aggression is due to the fact that your grandmother is confused and scared. Imagine living your life, 24/7, fearful of everything and everyone around you. The medications help ease that fear and anxiety, and allows your grandmother as well as her caregivers to have some peace in what is  the final stages of her life.

Rather than make the situation more stressful, go and visit your grandma and spend time with her. Show appreciation to her caregivers who are witnessing some of the most challenging periods of your grandmother's life. Ask them how you can help. Go grocery shopping, help clean the house, cook food for them.
Honestly, how this reads to me is that an elderly woman with dementia has become emotionally and physically abusive to those around her, and her doctor is treating her aggression the only way we currently know how. Yes, antipsychotic will make her more confused and such, but also remember that there is no ""getting better"" with dementia. There may be some slowing of progression, but the disease always gets worse until it takes our loved ones away completely. Your grandmother's moments of lucidity are only that, a cruel joke played by the disease to give you hope when there is none.

I'm sorry to sound so bleak, but please remember that you are not there and don't really know the whole story. Your grandfather and mother could be downplaying your grandmother's behavior to protect you (my parents did this during my gramma's decline). Voice your concerns to your mother, then let it go. Your mother and grandfather are doing the best they can.
Just move in full time and be her and grandpas caretaker. Your issue with her care will be solved.
You stated she was already rapidly declining prior to the medication. The negative side effects you attribute to the medication are also symptoms of Alzheimers (confusion, irregular sleeping habits, memory problems). Let the woman take the medication that keeps her calm so she doesn't need to live what life she has left in a state of agitation.
Are you taking care of her directly? Living with her day to day?
With dementia, there is always that question in caregivers’ minds, “Is this the best we can do for my loved one?”  Unfortunately, dementia behaviors can be so challenging we need to focus on “good enough” care.

Am I happy that my mom is on antipsychotics and occasional sedatives?  No.  But she needs a shower regularly and she needs clean clothes and she can’t be tossing shirts and pants out in the halls or throwing them away.  Or being vicious to the staff who are trying so hard to keep her clean.

She’s happier.  The anger is gone.  She tells me she’s feeling okay and that she just loves everyone where she lives.  This is huge.  Yes she’s on a ton of medications but the dementia is bad, she’s on hospice and I just want these last days, as confused as they are, to be easy ones.  

Please keep in mind that dementia is a terminal illness and it’s so hard to determine medications.  The hospice doctor has been so good- I do trust him to make sure my mom is feeling her best and is up and doing things- medications actually give her the mood lift to get out of bed.  Is she confused? Absolutely.  How much is medications and how much is the dementia?  Very hard to say but no way would I want her feeling like she did a year ago, depressed and angry on top of dementia.

Visit all you can, is my advice.
You don't know better than doctors who treat dementia. Sorry, but you don't. They have direct experience with this very frustrating, terrible disease. It does not get better. Your grandmother is never going to be who she was, as difficult as it is to accept, that is the reality. Aggression is part of it. Getting off antipsychotics won't improve things. 

All of us have had the same thoughts and the truth is that the disease changes their personalities on every level. 

They are there to give the patient peace from the demons of dementia. It takes away the constant anxiety and confusion they experience. It's awful, we know. But it is the sad reality.

The meds are not so much to make her easier to deal with, but to ease HER symptoms.
>I have done extensive research in the field

Oh, what's your H-index?
Just last week my mother started getting more aggressive than usual.  She attempted self harm. U am the only person caring for her. I love my mother.  But her aggressive behavior and destroying our apartment was too much. She is currently in a facility to help calm her. If I was on yhe outside looking in I might think the same way that you are. But your grandmother's safety and the safety of her caregivers should be above your feeling of wanting her to have some normalcy.  There is no more normalcy.  What you ThINK she is feeling is likely not HER reality.
It's always easy for someone not there to decide what the best treatment would be. From experience, your grandpa and mother are more than likely not telling you all that's going on and until you live it, you have absolutely NO IDEA. I'm sorry if that seems brutal, but it's the truth. Trust me, you think you know, but you have no idea the pain and stress of always wondering if they are going to wander or fall or eat something they shouldn't, or get angry and try to slap someone or worse. Or if they're still able, go to the bathroom and finger paint the walls with poop. But, if you truly feel like she's not getting the proper care, you can call adult protective services or the doctor, but most doctors will take the word of the people actually living there.
Sometimes Dementia does unfortunately cause psychosis and antipsychotics are the only way to go.  However you are feeling, your grandmother is probably feeling worse and imagine not being able to express it because of a horrible disease that is taking everything away from you.  I know it sucks and it’s not something you want her to be on but trust in the doctors now.  They need to find the right balance of meds to make sure she is living her best quality of life.
Meanwhile, I wish my dad would take his prescribed medication. I'm sorry that your situation is so impossible right now :(
No she isn't getting worse - she is progressing through this awful disease. Antipsychotics are an appropriate response- truly. Aggression is just one of the awful components and it is hell to deal with so yes this medication helps. Dementia patients don't gain memory back, they don't get better, they will progress through at their own speed. You may not like it and if you want her off antipsychotics I suggest you become her full time carer and take her off them but please make sure you wean her off slowly!",2022-02-13 15:30:10,Poop_Feast42069,srs5mf
Dementia,Enrichment Ideas for my Father,"My father is about 5 years into Lewy Body Dementia. He is completely immobilized but does have a surprising about of alertness. He is “not there” a lot but I also am suspicious that he is flat out bored. He watches TV all day everyday. The same shows. From when he was a middle aged man. He is a man of few hobbies to begin with, but he loved to gamble and play cards. 

Before I even suggest this, I was hoping to get some people who know to weigh in on an idea and how to carry it out.

I was thinking maybe he could at a good time have enough alertness to play a little blackjack. He can’t sit all the way up so I would need to hold or suspend his cards up so he could see them. I could be wrong that he could try it and it would be upsetting. Or just the logistics could make something enjoyable like this to be stressful. 

His memory is truly confusing to me, and I’m sort of new coming into the picture but he can forget immediate things, but does know I’ve been here for two days and who I am. He remembers he was a musician, the instruments he played, but no idea what songs he played. We were estranged for many reasons for over 20 years, but he knows exactly who I am at all times. 

Any ideas?","I'd try playing poker games on the tv and see if he responds
A set of magnetic cards with a small board on an easel for him might work here.",2022-02-13 12:00:42,Ms_sharty_pants,srn8mw
Dementia,chess based memory game,"Hi

I made a  chess inspired memorisation game on the browser. You get to see a chess position for a certain amount of time, once the time is up, some pieces will be removed and you have to reconstruct the position from memory by dragging pieces. I think this small game could be beneficial for dementia patients, especially when they like chess, id love to have some feedback on this.

Dementia,"I'm new... but joined some time ago... I'm not normally one to discuss my personal life in a public space, but I can't keep holding it in... I need a place to Talk with People who Understand..","My father's cognition has been deteriorating steadily over the past few years, but when (and after) he was in the hospital last summer, I noticed a sharp decline. The last seven months have been a particular living Hell. His care team and I had been trying to persuade him to accept some form of home support so that he could be wait-listed for assisted living, all to no avail. Whenever the subject came up, it was always ""I'll think about it."" He said much the same thing when I suggested he get a TV, or a microwave... I'm not sure if it has been the dementia, natural stubbornness, or him trying to cling to the little control he has left.... Sometimes I even wonder if his refusal to eat adequately (he's skin and bones and claims to have no appetite) is a part of trying to control something.

A couple of weeks ago, though... everything accelerated.. As you may have surmised, he has been living alone, and to date, he was, more or less, coping... kind of... maybe. I wish I could have him live with me, but, for various reasons, that simply isn't an option... In addition to seeing him once a week, I was phoning him every day... On January 29, he didn't pick up the phone. Since he was sill going out to do his own shopping, I wasn't *too* worried at first, but I after trying to call again a couple of times, I knew something was very wrong, so I called a cab to his place, and let myself in. I found my father, bruised, and bleeding in places, on the floor of his bedroom, semi-conscious.... Immediately I called 911, and he has been in the hospital since. Apparently he suffered an Nstemi ... we're not sure if his fall caused the heart attack, or if the attack caused the fall... Until this evening, when he called me from the hospital, he thought he was on a boat after having been on some kind of a trip... This time, though, it was a lot worse... he accused me of locking him up ""on the boat,"" along with a lot of really hurtful stuff... and I just couldn't reach him.... couldn't make him understand I'd found him on the floor... 

Last week, I met with his care team, and they have determined, after observing him in hospital that he has reached another lower baseline of cognition... They feel (and I concur) that it is no longer safe for him to be alone, so when he is released, he'll be getting live-in support, which means I need to acquire a bed for the homecare worker and place it in his living room/dining area, and make it relatively private.. 

All things considered... I'm *extremely* worried at how this is going to go... My father is stubborn, fiercely independent... Also, when he was young.. he climbed mountains as a hobby... and being a marine engineer gave him considerable freedom of movement, not just in his profession, but also because he could pick and choose where he lived (we moved around a lot...)

Just...seeing him like this....it's.... the worst thing I have ever experienced, and it's tearing me apart at every level... I'm a pretty secular person, but... honestly, if there is such a thing as Hell.. this is it. I doubt I need to tell anyone here that, though...","Ohhhh, WickedWenchOfTheWest, I'm so very sorry, yeh it's very hard & tough - I feel for you!. 

My dad is similar, as many oldies, it can be absolute battle to get them to accept assistance, in-home care workers, moving to facility... An unpleasant frustrating battle.  I care for my mum 24/7 at her home (dad is interstate), it was slightly less battle to get her to accept in-home visits.  In the end I had to sort of trick/bully her into some 'temporary' in-home service visits, & then ease into a few more - and that was all WITH letters from her own doctor advising that she needed to avail herself of services.   

Idk, for your case, I wonder if it might not be best all-round, to bite the bullet, & start trying to get him a residential facility placement?   I understand that his own home being his own familiar environment, and it's a huge traumatic step to go residential, but suddenly having a stranger living in his lounge-room, sounds like it will be an extremely challenging task for the care-worker, you might have problems retaining anyone?  Also there'll have to be a few of them, taking turns.  That's going to be hard & traumatic for your dad, also for the workers.  It might not go well at all.  Idk... 

Idk, have you contacted your area dementia .org or alzheimers .org?  They have tons of resources, tips, counselling, etc covering all aspects of memory-loss issues for the memory-lossed themselves & their family / friends / carers... Here down in Australia, they've been wonderful assistance to us.   So sorry, OP, I feel for you!   Best of luck!
 My mom is also very stubborn and was fiercly indepnedent.  She tells me daily that my sister should leave because she is fine being alone.  This from a woman who can't stand or toilet on her own.

It is one of the worst diseases.  You watch your loved one diappear little by little.  I feel like I have a scab on my heart that gets torn away every day.
My mother was also very independent and very private.  The hardest thing I ever had to do in my life was to take charge when the dementia got worse. 

Medication helps.  She needs lorazepam or nobody can get her into the shower.  And we have found that an aide who is over the top funny and a bit tough is the best person to work with my mom.  My mom will swear and shout, leave me alone, refuses to get out of bed or eat but if one aide comes in and says, Woman! Get your booty out of that bed! We have pancakes and you need to eat them! then my mom listens.  And eats.  There’s a lot of laughing and hugging- and my mom was never very demonstrative but this new approach works.

She tends to save her ire for me- please know that the people closest to the person with dementia are often the ones who get the most verbal abuse.  An aunt had to step back from visiting her husband in memory care because of all the yelling and blame- she sent a close friend in her place so he would have a regular visitor and he enjoyed that.

In short- it might be rough at the onset for your father.  The word “nevertheless” is key if he is angry about all the changes.  “Nevertheless we have Diane coming in to take care of you today.”  And talk to his doctor about medication for mood- dementia affects that as well.
My mum's fiercely independent too. It took for her to have a bad fall for things to change. She never wanted to go into a nursing home, but eventually it wasn't her decision anymore, it was mine. This illness is just awful. Even the most sensible, logical roads seem impossible to go down until you're forced to. I had to get into the mind set that as long as I was making decisions for the best outcome - to protect her - and not making those decisions in isolation (talking to professionals and people with experience of dementia), then I had to forgive myself and move forward no matter how painful it was. 

My mum's situation is so much better now. Her nursing home is Wonderful and she gets very well socialized, pampered and cared for. She would have never made that decision for herself and would have sat in her apartment with no one to talk to all these months. I would be ill trying to keep her alive. 

I've heard that people with dementia often have bad falls or tragic things happen to them before they get the help they need.
I'm so glad you are there for your father. I'm watching it eat away at both my parents (Mom's in a MC facility, I'm living with Dad for now). The amount of stress and care that a person suffering with this disease is overwhelming. 

Here's an option - only because he's fighting you every step of the way. Don't let them release him from the hospital in your care. This is a tough call but it's an opportunity to get him into a safe facility without your having to deal with wait lists, etc. If you refuse to accept him into your care, the hospital will have to place him. He's obviously not safe at home, and finding and keeping home health care can be hit or miss. If he's not going to accept a caretaker, you'll soon be back at square one. 

I'm so sorry you have to go through this. It's definitely one of the levels of Hell.
I feel like im reading about my own grandmother's situation as I read about your dad. 

First and foremost, yes, this feels like hell most days. Everyone is living a different journey through their relationship with dementia, but we can all agree on this one thing. It. Is. Hell. 

A little background: I also would call my grandma daily until one day she didn't pick up. Didn't think much of it because she was still somewhat active at that point and struggling to hear the phone ring unless she was close by. But once worry set in and I went over, I realized I should've worried a lot sooner. I'll save you the details. 

To this day (she JUST got approved to be added to a long term care list, but doesn't know it yet) she is incredibly stubborn. She's giving her nurses a real run for their money - trying to get out of bed (we get calls a couple times a week that grandma fell out of bed AGAIN), being sneaky and mischievous about taking her medications, absolutely refusing any and all support & mobility care, etc etc. 

Unfortunately she still thinks she will be going home at some point, but it just isn't feasible given her condition. I personally think it'll be way easier on my grandma to transition right from the hospital & into LTC. Instead of being moved home first. 

I know it sucks to see a parent decline. It really really really sucks. Be proud to be decended from someone so passionately independent.
I’m so sorry it’s come to this, but I think it’s time to put him in a residential care facility. If he has in-home care, he will simply run them off. You’ll be constantly trying to hire replacements and that won’t be easy. He will soon end up in residential care, so moving him there now is probably going to be the easiest for both of you, whether he can see it or not.
Instead of editing my OP, it might be easier to just comment quickly... I want to say, you are all wonderful, and later on, when things have eased a little, I want to write out some proper replies.

Just one thing I should note, since many of you reference this... Where I live, somebody has to be receiving some form of home support ***before*** they can be wait-listed for a facility... I understand some of the reasoning, but... given my father's current condition, I feel this logic may be more than a little flawed.... I agree with everyone who says it would be better for him to go directly to a care home from the hospital, but, sadly, that isn't possible... \*sigh\*

Again.... thank you.... thank you all so much..",2022-02-13 00:45:10,WickedWenchOfTheWest,srbdmb
Dementia,The weirdest thing by now,"I made a post some time ago about my grandmother having a really ugly fit, wanting to get out to the house and to another that doesn't exist anymore. But fortunately my dad actually made something for her and took her to a new doctor that gave her new medication, and her levels of anxiety and that stuff got down, and she's pretty calm. And now, after months of this, she has started to do a real unusual thing: I think she's ""touching herself"" (if you know in what sense I'm talking). She touches herself and mumbles to herself, even when all of us are around, but I never can listen clearly to what she's whispering (and to be honest, I don't want to). It's really uncomfortable, and none us talk about it because... I don't know, it's such a weird thing and it's often too.","Disordered sexual behaviors are common in dementia patients. Here are some ways to manage it. https://dailycaring.com/9-ways-to-handle-alzheimers-and-sexually-inappropriate-behavior/
Many toddlers go through a similar stage. Sadly she can’t learn the way a toddler can by simply telling her this type of touching isn’t polite to do in front of others. 

I am not sure of her stage of dementia - maybe she can be distracted with a different activity like sorting buttons, folding clothes, etc. I would imagine as the disease progresses it will stop.
I've heard of this happening, but I have no experience with it. I just know my mum needs to be entertained and stimulated mentally, constantly. When she's bored, her anxiety increases, she begins to worry about everything and becomes very low. Her obsessive traits are smoking, sorting through her drawers and hiding things. When nothing else is going on, she will automatically start one of these three things.

Like someone else said, maybe it's about distracting and diverting attention away from that activity? 

Sorry I can be more help.
Yep, this happens. I know from personal experience. The first time is kinda shocking but after that just try and have a laugh about it. Just give ‘em some privacy.",2022-02-12 16:00:02,BanksyGuy00018,sr13yb

Dementia,It's over. Good? Bad? I don't know.,"My dad passed away this morning. I think it was the best exit we could have hoped for. He just sort of stopped eating last week, closed his eyes, and never really woke back up. Hospice was wonderful and did everything they could to make him comfortable, so I don't think he really suffered on his way out.

I'm depressed but relieved - Lewy Body took so much from him and made him suffer so much, and he was already, in many respects, gone well before this. So I'm glad he's no longer trapped in its claws. But I'm sad because he didn't deserve any of this and now I REALLY don't have a dad.

In sum, fuck dementia.","I'm sorry and yes, fuck dementia.  It kills the person and leaves the body behind for years.  It forces us into feeling a mixture of grief and guilt when they finally pass because of an element of relief that seems disloyal and unloving.  I hope that the memories of the good times will eventually soften the experience of the bitter end so you can mourn and then be grateful for the love and laughter that came before.
Sending you so much love and condolences. I hope that you can be surrounded by love and support over the following days, weeks, and months ahead. And I hope you can be kind and tender with yourself in whatever form that takes. 💗
I am so sorry you lost your father.  It’s hard missing the person they were before the disease wrecked their mind and robbed them of dignity and relationships and so much else.    You are right- he didn’t deserve all the hell that dementia dishes out.

He did his best.  You did too, by looking out for him and making sure he was safe and well cared for.  

Again, I’m so sorry.  No one can replace your father.
I’m so sorry.

Its rough, so many feelings.

its ok to wait to process your emotions and focus on the practical stuff.

I think that is normal, to distance yourself until you can be in a good place to grieve.
And everyone has their own timeline.

It’s certainly very hard on everyone, and it’s ok to take care of yourself.
Maybe write him a letter, and burn it so the ashes float on the wind.
Hugs to you!
I’m so sorry you are going through this. It really is a different type of grieving, eh?  Sending you lots of internet hugs
I think both. At least, that's how I felt when my dad passed. As well as angry, guilty, powerless, relieved and devastated.

I'm so so sorry for your loss.
I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope you are able to take the time and space to grieve in different ways for all the aspects of your dad lost over time. Sending love.
Lucky to have a peaceful passing. That's a blessing.
So sorry for your loss OP. My dad went the same way essentially and I get how you’re feeling. I thought I’d feel more instant relief because the suffering was over. But I felt more….meh about it. Like it just sucked. Thinking of you and your family today ❤️
Yes f👆🏻ck dementia and I’m so sorry that you’ve lost your Dad ♥️ glad that you feel he didn’t suffer so that’s one thing to be relieved about.
I’m so sorry for your loss. May your good

After a fall on the driveway of the facility, they got him upstairs to his apartment and cleaned up his scrapes. In due time, his daughter took her leave and as she went toward the door, he said, ""You're not going to stick around for my next fall? I've got moves.""

Thank you in advance","[deleted]
Listen, smile, let them be themselves in the moment. Talk to them about the moment...my Dad would talk about fishing with his grandfather, so I could say tell me about the boat, where did you go, what did you catch. Then maybe be prepared to have this conversation right over again. Naturally that's weird because that's not what we are used to...think of it as being an actor and now you are doing a scene over. Don't take things personal if they are in a bad mood because it's not you (unless you are not being nice).
I don't yet know how this will feel, but my mom has been declining for about a year now. 

She's still mostly pretty good but I've started to see some huge memory gaps. It's been awful and very sad to see this unfold, but I suppose there is the benefit of it preparing me for the next phase: one of these days she will not know who I am. It will be awful and painful, but what I've come to understand through all this and underneath that terrible disease, my mom is still in there.

One of the ways I know this, is that even when she's had a particularly bad day where she is very mixed up, agitated and doesn't know where she is, I can give her a hug and it's the very same, tight, loving hug that she's always given. 

We were told early on in the diagnosis that ""the love remains"" even in cognitive decline. And I've heard more than a few stories to suggest this is true. 

Good luck to you and your Nanna. I hope you have a really wonderful visit with her. Love is strong. ❤️
Have no expectations, go with the flow no matter where it goes.  Smile, be kind, hold her hand if she allows, don't correct her if she calls you by the wrong name.  Accept her for who she is at the present time. Just be gentle with her and be gentle with yourself.
There is really nothing to be worried about. If she doesn't know who you are that's ok. My FIL is 3 years into his dementia and sometimes he knows who I am and other times he doesn't. He has good days and not so good days.

This is my first time dealing with this disease and in all honesty it sucks. There is very little you or I can do, its out of our hands. Watching someone waste away slowly is devastating to everyone involved.

Don't expect a lot and you won't be disappointed. If she remembers you that's great. If not you need to be prepared. This disease is merciless but you need to remember if things go not so well, that it's the disease controlling your loved one. She is not the same person that you ounce knew.

I wish you luck and hope things go well for you.
Since you're going with your dad I don't know if he sees her regularly or not but if it's the first time for both of you it might be quite shocking to him as well. What I found is with my own loved one with dementia is that if I just express my love and happy to see him he will feel that. When I have gone to visit my dad with other relatives including my brother their reactions sometimes bother me more than my dad's reactions if that makes sense. No matter what try not to argue with your dad if emotions are strong for either one of you. It won't help your nana and it may harm your relationship with your own father.
Don't quiz her. Instead of saying ""Do you know who I am?"" say, ""Hi, Nana, it's me, your grandchild OP."" Instead of ""Do you remember..."" say ""I remember when we..."" 

Try to keep your voice and facial expressions pleasant. She's likely to reflect back the emotions she perceives in you. 

Relax and enjoy your visit. It's a gift, not a test.
Treat every conversation normal. I found I probably will repeat every sentence 5 or 6 times because she starts to understand what I say, it's better to let them guide the conversation. Being happy, smiling and really just the regular treatment is the best way to go. Also talk a little slower I find they can follow a conversation a bit better.
She may not recognize you as her grandson, but very possibly remembers that her grandson exists, and imagines him to be younger than you. Ask her to tell you about him. Ask her if she wants help writing a letter to him by dictation. You can write and mail letters back to her, as the grandson.",2022-02-11 19:13:36,mxtero1,sqdtnt
Dementia,Teepa Snow never met my grandma.,"I've watched like an hour of these videos and my main takeaway is ""be sweet, gentle, don't rush, don't get cross, try to figure out why she's upset, slowly guide her....""  It doesn't matter how gently and sweetly we try redirect or to massage her into the correct choice to alleviate her discomfort (like accepting pain medicine or letting us change her diaper). We can spend 2 hours sweetly and gently meandering our way to the action point. She directly goes to ""NO"" and as soon as we take any actual action no matter how gently, she still goes straight to calling us liars, screaming TAKE ME HOME, CALL THE COPS, THEY'RE POISONING ME, stiffening her muscles, ""kicking"", scratching. And this was around noon today, when we're supposed to get her awake to avoid oversleep and then sundowning. I'm so tired.","Your mileage may vary. For meds, does she have any relaxing ones, like anti-anxiety or anti-depression ones that may chill her out? In my moms later days we had to just start upping some of the pills that helped her calm down because she would get very upset, crying, talking loudly, that sort of thing. They put her to sleep, but at that stage it didn't really matter, it was more comfort over anything.
Cut the two hours then. If you know the panic is coming, brace yourself for it. Move confidently through the task, as gently as possible. She will likely forget the drama afterwards, or at the very least you're minimizing everyone's pain by moving at a fair clip. There is a difference between confident movement and forceful rushing. But things need done for hygiene and health reasons. And you deserve to not spend all day doing every little task. It's ok for her to be upset, if you're being as kind as possible in a bad situation.
I hear you on this! I think Teepa Snow is good for people that have zero experience with dementia, but some of her advice can put you in a dangerous position if you don’t know how to read your person or the situation.
I think I have heard advice along the lines of - don't ask your loved one if they want to do ""x"", ask your loved one if they want to do ""x"" now or do ""x"" later.
(Never heard of Teepa Snow.  Sounds like I should give it a miss.)

Sorry for your situation.

I have learned so much... humility, or something.  I would now NEVER presume to tell anyone else how to care for their dementia relative.  Lots of times, **nothing works.**  

And telling caregivers to be sweet, be gentle, try to figure out why she's upset etc then makes the caregivers feel awful when it doesn't work, as if it's their fault -- when, in fact, there was no winning move.

We each have to do our best and be decent, and recognize that we can't always succeed (in fact, at some point, by definition, we WON'T succeed).

Hang in there.  I will if you will. :)",2022-02-11 13:28:35,Its0nlyAPaperMoon,sq63pf
Dementia,My grandpa is asking for people that don’t exist.,"My grandpa(81) was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and put on quetiapine (50mg) and two other drugs I don’t know the names of. 
I visited them today and he asked “where’s the boy?” I don’t have brothers, neither does my mom, I’ve never brought boys in the house so there’s no “boy” he could’ve asked for. Is this normal? He used to only ask about where his dead mother and grandma was but never this.","Unfortunately yes.   Some days will be better than others and some will be worse.
As others have said- totally normal. BUT it’s also a great intro into gentle family conversations. Which boy? Oh, I don’t know that boy, but do you remember the story great grandma used to tell about when you were a boy? … and so on.
My dad always asks where the baby is or where the dog is when in fact we don't have a baby or a dog. So definitely not alone!
My mom believes our house cleaner brings her daughter with her.  She doesn't, she comes alone.  Mom is also certain that the daughter steals from her.
I'd suggest watching some Teepa Snow videos on YouTube. It helped a lot with my mom when she started down this road.

We had kind of a weird twist on a situation like that. My mom, in memory care, told us every day that there was a little boy who came to see her and would spend hours in her room with her. This went on for months, none of us ever saw a little boy in her room with her, never any evidence of any kids coming by to see her even though Mom insisted they colored together etc. We just chalked it up to a hallucination or dream and got on with life. 

Then during my niece's birthday party, her mom came running over dragging another lady, all excited. The other lady worked in the memory care unit, her husband watched their kids during the day while she worked and on his way to work he'd drop the kids off with her because she'd be getting off at the same time he was headed in. Only some days she had to work a few minutes over so these two little boys would be in the dining room/activities area interacting with the patients for a few minutes. They were always well-behaved. The older of the two really loved my mom and started asking if he could just stop in to see her until his mom got off work. So a couple of days a week for like 5 minutes there was a real live little boy coming to hang out with her. 

Anyway, the little boy is probably real, but from his past. It's best if you just go with it and make up some excuse for why he's not there. Denying his existence is going to upset him.
Yep, sounds about right to me. 

I read somewhere that the best way to deal with things like this, where you have no idea what they're talking about and it might be entirely imagined, is to use the old improv rule - always say ""yes and....,"" never ""no"" or ""yes but...""  There's no harm in going along with it, whereas challenging their reality tends to not go well (and there's no point to it). I'm prepared to make up people right and left if mom asks about them. 

(lol, it may help that I DM D&D games and have a lot of experience inventing NPCs!)
My mom has Alzheimer’s. She still thinks I’m 18 years old. In 47. At Christmas she thought my daughter’s boyfriend was mine. This is “normal” for Alzheimer’s. It’s a terrible disease. I grieve for my mom even though she’s still alive. It’s not my mom in there, If that makes sense. The best thing I learned is not to argue unless they try to do something to harm themselves or others. If he asks again, just say he’s at work, or at school. Check out careblazers on YouTube. It helped me so much to understand what’s going on
My mom does this too.  I usually say, Gosh, I must have just missed seeing them, I hate when I do that!  I change the subject then.    

Things are so mixed up.  It’s like being in a chapter of Alice In Wonderland some days, isn’t it?  I just try and come up with replies that make my mom content.  Lately she’s been worried about my dad- she’s been divorced from him for nearly 30 years and he’s been dead for 10.  Now she feels kindly towards him and when she asks I tell her he’s working at his business in Florida, he’s fine as always.  And it’s okay.
Unfortunately yes, my Dad used to be CONVINCED I had a daughter ( I only have boys lol) and that she would be left out in the backyard at night and we had to let her in.
When we moved my MIL into her facility, she too confused us with ""where's the boy."" Turned out the ""boy"" was a nearly 50-year-old-guy who was setting up the TV for her.
Yes, Careblazers on YouTube is an excellent resource.

One of their suggestions:  never argue with a person who has dementia

also, to meet them where they're at. If they are scared about a person

coming into the house at night, don't try to argue that no one is coming into the house.

Empathize with the feeling, ""You're worried about people getting into the house.

  That does sound scary. Do you think if we locked the windows it would be more secure?""

&#x200B;

Care Blazers has many ideas for  coping with challenging behavoirs that are respectful of the elder person while preserving your sanity.
I feel like there is a boy from some time and place he is referring to, but who knows. It’s okay to not know what he means, you can ask questions or just play along and say the boy is away. It’s interesting though I wonder who he is thinking of.
My grandma is to the point of wanting to be home. A home that hasn’t been there for 30 years.",2022-02-11 12:46:01,MelanieSenpai,sq54ro
Dementia,Thoughts on Carnation nutritious drink mixes,As a add on with meals,"Hey OP, I bought a blender with extraction blades (it's a nutribullet- am in no way affiliated with them, just telling you what I'm doing) and giving my family member little shakes with fruits and veggies. It's working really well so far and the nice thing is the extraction blades (kinda blunt looking) free a lot of moisture out of the veggies so I'm not having to add much liquid. Also I'm able to add a little oatmeal (my loved one hates oatmeal) so we get a bit of fiber on the sly lol. The thing also pulverizes almonds so we're getting some omega 3's that were previously going uneaten. (It all goes in the shake canister thing and comes out as a smoothie... magical ✨). 

Hope you find something that helps
Sugar bombs. I'd personally avoid it.
We use Ensure. At least those have a little protein. And my mom still thinks she needs to diet, but she’s stuck in that weird late 70s / early 80s period when all the convenience foods were somehow super good for you… so she’ll drink Ensure, and she won’t drink any type of proper smoothie. Good luck. It’s a lot of trial and error!
I care for my mom w/PD, i juice celery daily which helps us both stay hydrated and she drinks a powder protein mix with collagen peptides in almond milk maybe twice a week as a treat.
I think is depends on your situation. In my case I have them on hand to make a milkshake when a meal is missed or not eaten. I am trying to keep their weight level so I need the extra calories. The problem is cold creamy things make them cough so it's a imperfect solution. If they did not make them cought it would me making daily homemade high protine smoothies. But it's just a back up meal for us.",2022-02-11 11:59:38,ghost_queen21,sq41p9

Dementia,Any advice?,"A bit of background - I'm 28m, working as a surgical trainee about 300miles from my parents. My brother 32m (only sibling) lives a similar distance and is finishing a PhD, he is lovely, but has a history of severe depression and struggles to deal with negative emotions. My dad has early dementia, just about holding onto a part time job but is in complete denial.

My mum and I have been trying to help dad and gently suggest he should get the last scan. My brother is aware and we don't hide anything but also we don't actively talk to him about it. The vague plan is once I get a reg job (same training region for 5 years) my parents will move to be near me (I can't afford to live where they do). 

Just had phone call with my mum - she was saying how dad's getting worse etc. I asked her how she is doing, she broke down in tears. I try to come home minimum once a month for a weekend (I work 1/4), we call every weekend and I try to call midweek to say hi. 

I'm planning on asking mum about possible depression this week (exam so I'm down there). Is there anything else I can do? I'm trying to organise a trip for us to go to Kew Gardens as we both enjoy plants but that won't be for months. 

I just feel somewhat useless - I barely see my new gf anyway due to where we live. But I feel like I need to be home more to help my parents. 

Any advice? 

Tldr what can I do to help my mum deal with dad's early dementia (on denial).","A tough call and it's a tough time for you. First and foremost take care of yourself. Keep an eye open for the signs of depression in yourself - this is a very stressful time. Seek medical help if you need it. Talk to others around you for support, and burst into tears yourself if you need to, there's no shame in it.

You are already doing what you believe you can, but here is where you need to decide your priorities. Keep supporting your Mum and your family. If your Mum keeps bursting into tears at least be a long distance shoulder to cry on. See if you can arrange more time to be with your parents, even if it delays your training. 

Let your brother decide how much support he can be. If he has a history of depression he has probably developed ways of managing it. At least give him the choice.

See if the wider family can help - aunts, uncles, cousins. What about friends of your parents? Set up a WhatsApp group of all the supporters so you can easily keep in touch.

Where am I coming from? 60m, lived for 9 months with my mother-in-law while she was dying of cancer. A month after my wife and I moved in, my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. She has survived. That was 2014. 

Now my 95 year old Mum, who has vascular dementia, is in hospital with cancer and all they can do is make her comfortable. I live 280 miles away. Luckily for me, and Mum, my brother lives close to her, so she gets regular visits. Though I did manage to get down there and see her last weekend. Depression? Been there, got the T shirt. I am still on anti depressants because of being made redundant in 2019 and not getting a job till late last year. Guess I am going to stay on them a bit longer.
You are at the stage where there are no good answers, only which bad answer you can live with. I'm so sorry.  


Could they get a home health aid to come in and give your mom a break? Could you dad go to an occasional day program?
Although your dad's in denial, it sounds like your mum needs support. Ironically, this wicked disease can be just as hard, if not harder, on those who care for & love the person with the actual diagnoses. 

Encourage your mum  to consult her GP. In addition to helping with any depression she may be experiencing, he can refer her to whatever resources are available to your parents. If your dad's in denial, but your mum's seeing a deterioration, I'd recommend she consults the local dementia team. They will be able to advise on practical matters, and if our experience is standard, will do so with empathy and offer genuine support on the emotional side. 

If your mum's feeling isolated, perhaps encourage her to join a local carer's group?
I'm currently living with my 97-year-old demented mom.  My husband lives at our house with our pets, about 12 miles away.  One of the most helpful things that he did was to have my mom give permission for him to change the billing address for every recurring bill, statement, etc. to our house.  He then set them all up on auto-pay.  On occasion, Mom needs to sign a check to pay a bill, but he takes care of everything else.  Maybe you could do something similar for your parents?
Hire a caretaker to help your mom help your dad. This is basically a choice between family and money. If you can't be with your family for the sake of money, use that money to help your family. If you can be the one to help them you don't need money to hire someone.",2022-02-11 05:54:57,Aggravating-Look1689,spwqxj
Dementia,My dads Dementia is eating at me...,"I know I post in here a lot but need to vent somewhere...my dad had a bad day he pooped himself and had to be washed. It upset my mom a lot. Since my wedding the 11th of December he has just gone down. Gotten worse, more confused..more falling, peeing more on the floor then in his commode. Looking more and more out of it. He also had a bad chest always sounds breathless..he takes a puff for allergies and puff for astma, we have tried cough medicine and antibiotics. .nothing works...he keeps coughing but never coughs out mucus saying he is too weak. My mom refuses to accept that my dad has dementia and gets very angry at my dad when he does stupid things saying he does it on purpose, he just laughs. I have accepted my dad won't get better, i have accepted he won't be the same dad anymore, but that does not mean that i like seeing him like this. It hurts and breaks my heart. I feel so overwhelmed and depressed.","A virtual hug to you. Our dad died from dementia in June. Dementia sucks. We had our dad in diapers for about a year before he passed. Yea it sucks to see and wash your dad's private parts, but the worst part is that he never questioned it. We just ""changed his underwear"". He did get up to go, but sometimes he didn't make it, hence the diapers. Daddy would ""sundown"" pretty bad after dark, sometimes not sleeping, getting ready for work, etc. His primary care worked hand in hand with us for anything we needed, he gave us low dose ativan so he could sleep at night (and us too). It took us a bit to learn not to get angry at the person in our dad's body. He couldn't help the way that he was. Our mom died in  2013 and that might have been the beginning?? Ito took us a bit to figure it out. There were 5 of us that took care of him 24/7 for 2 1/2 years. Dementia is called the shrinking brain disease

Dementia sucks
We had my dad in hospice before he got this bad. They knew he wasn't going to improve; he was dying, and their focus is to make him comfortable. Now he gets drugs like morphine for his pain from falling.

The only way I handle the reality is to focus on the core essence of my father and his spirit that is still accessible, so when I visit him I try to overlook the horrors and peer beyond to seek out his humanity. Sometimes this happens to the point I feel joy; other times I can't seem to conjure him much, but I know my presence comforts him, and I know he feels my love.

Some nights after a visit I am grateful I was able to comfort him and experience him despite the horrors, and other nights I just drink to dampen my nightmares.

As for your mother, that's some profound denial, perhaps a defense mechanism on her part. I would encourage you to get medical experts to inform her about the reality of his condition.
Rant away.

Dementia is awful.  I’m watching my Dad deteriorate as well.  
He’s bored, depressed, and anxious.
All of his close friends have passed away.

He comes to visit me and my pup almost every day.  Ok, he visits my puppy, not me.  I’m okay with it, even if I WFH, so can’t chit chat with him every time he is here.
But that will end soon, he won’t be able to drive much longer.
Then I know it will go down hill.

He’s mean to my sweet Mom, because he’s frustrated and/or can’t articulate what he wants/needs.
He’s not the same wonderful Grandpa to my niece and nephew that he was to my much older kids.  

It’s like losing them twice.  I wouldn’t wish this on anyone.
This forum is why we're here. Rant all you want.   I need to rant. I'm having a terrible time in the year in supposed to be getting married. Ugh
I’m no medical professional, but I would have your father checked out ASAP for cardiac issues. The coughing, weakness and breathlessness could be signs of heart failure, which may go hand in hand with vascular dementia. Having a heart attack or stroke could accelerate vascular dementia so it’s best to have a doctor examine and at least rule out such things.
Its just a heartbreaking illness. And so common for family to fall into denial because it's so hard to accept and deal with. I also identify with having to wash and change a parent with Dementia. Mum was so ashamed at first, but was also self medicating with laxitives and not accepting personal care from her carers. Eventually we got her into a fantastic nursing home and she's past that chapter. Accepting her dementia and pouring lots of love into our relationship has helped us through the times when she's low, feels lonely and depressed. She can feel very frustrated, ashamed and angry at times.

Learning about dementia and what helps my mum through these episodes has done wonders for our relationship. But there are loads of my family members - particularly her siblings - who would rather pretend she's perfectly fine. My brothers find it very frustrating and can't really find much compassion for our mum.

My dad is gone a year now and hid mum's dementia diagnosis from us (because she was ashamed). She was an alcoholic all her life, so it wasn't a hard task. Maybe if we'd looked a bit closer, we'd have saw the signs? Maybe we didn't want to.
I feel you
Dementia is rough on all.  At times, it's too much to handle, and worse, there's so little we can do for them except try to make their remaining time as comfortable as possible.  It's overwhelming because it's nonstop heartbreaking work.

As others have said, it definitely sounds like he might have heart failure (accumulation of fluid around the heart).  My dad and mom had this and you're describing their symptoms.  That could also explain his sudden decline - with the heart not pumping well, less oxygen gets to the brain.  My dad really had problems when his weight (fluid accumulation) went up and he'd get all confused and couldn't concentrate.  Only a doctor can tell you for sure.  

Best of luck and rant on!
I’ve had my dad at home for four years w dementia! It’s now making me sick physically! I know nursing homes suck but keeping him home has ruined my life and so I say why God does this happen to good ppl?
The best way to do it is make your dad feel safe and at home- it sounds like your family could benefit from home supports. Sometimes it’s too much to take when it gets bad. Many patients at my hospital get brought in for this reason! They will match you with a social worker and liaison to help you find the next steps. It’s difficult but you don’t have to be alone in it.
Just try to make him happy.
I’m completely overwhelmed with my dads as well. I feel like I’ve gone from a little boy to a jaded old man watching this happen",2022-02-10 18:10:27,StudentTeacher278,spjf8k
Dementia,"Vascular dementia, recently found my grandma actually might have this. We might be going into the later form of dimensia now, any advice, things to know?","I know this group is good for learning of other experiences. So I'd love to know what this might mean. And what your experiences are. My grandma's health history are of what follows:

My grandma, has macular degeneration in her eyes. She has been getting treatment for it, which is a needle in the eye full of whatever medication and it's kept her sight going years longer, she would of been completely blind by now.

She hit her head on a tile floor 3 years back causing a skull fracture where she went through delirium afterwards due to a massive sodium imbalance. A normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). She hit 111 at one point where 110 you will go into a coma (it was a battle, a tough one that really made things difficult at home, she lives with us and we take care of her). She had dementia before this for many years but after this injury it definitely has sped up in progress. and she has to have sodium medications to keep her levels up for the rest of her life.

She also was 91 when she found out she has ciliac disease. Which is handled quite well

-------
Now done with all this medical background, and moving forward.

My grandma who is 95 now, was rushed to the hospital on  Sunday Feb 6th with stroke like symptoms. Slurred speach, couldn't form a conversation, started talking about herself in third person I think allowed her to talk a bit better. Called the ambulance, and one of the police trained medical professionals showed up did some tests, checking the blood levels/etc. 

What indicated its not a mini stroke (which that's what appeared to be what she was having) is my grandma's automated response to ANY DOCTOR where she sounds 100% normal, so that means she's still aware of some things going on. (she's like a kid, too afraid to tell the doctor she's not ok, almost like she's scared to be scolded) basically the conversation was this:

Paramedic: ""How are you feeling?"" 
Gram: ""oh great, I'm just fine, 100%!"" 
""No problems?"" 
""No, don't know why youre here, I feel wonderful!""
""Do you know what year it is?""
""..... Yeah...... Um........... September?""
""How old are you?""
""Um..... Its a big number................. I don't know....""
Few minutes later we have now 3 paramedics, two of which are from the ambulance that arrived, so they start conversing about the situation my grandma then want to talk to them, as she's sitting on the couch:
Gram: ""Hey doctor?""
Paramedic: ""Yes?""
""I'd like, um, when, like, um, uh, when? Ok is it? Um..""

She couldn't respond to questions that weren't related to how she felt, and she couldn't make sentences on the spot. They took her in, where she did make a recovery at the hospital.

They found nothing in cat scans, or anything unusual, sugar levels were somehow normal (she can go through a small bag of sugar in less than a week) her sodium level did drop to 131 (where she can go into a very mild state of delirium however, during delirium episodes she can still form sentences even when it hit a level of 116 so that wasn't it)

No sign of a blood clot on the brain etc... She was fine to go home at around 4am. 

Now visiting the eye clinic to get her shots a couple days later, the doctor there said it sounded like she has vesicular dementia. As this did affect her eyesight a bit when it happened(at least I think it did, she wasn't clear and we couldn't understand her). And he told us a lot of patients that are being treated like she is, have had this happen.

He explained that this could have been a clot (on the way to the brain) that might of limited the flow of blood to the brain. Which in turn leads to the symptoms she had. It can affect various parts the brain, eyes, etc. Leading to sentences not being formed, blindness, and made her incapable of making decisions.

Were still not 100% sure at home what may of happened here, but it does sound like a clot that blocked the passage of blood for a time frame, and she wasn't getting enough to the brain. 

I know I wrote a lot, but it's for a little bit of an understanding and I'd rather not get things wrong. We are talking to doctors next week about this incident, and from the sounds of things this does happen to people who have vesicular dementia. 

Her conginative ability is I'm estimating a range of 40-30% (doc said 30 last time but I think it's higher at home) right now, it was a drop from 60% in a four month period, but it hasn't decreased or increased from what I can tell so far. At least prior to this happening. 

Has anyone had this happen, where someone with vescular dementia suddenly loses cognitive ability in a small period of time. I know id mention this more to a doctor and will be talking to them about it this week, but really I'd like to know more about this by the experiences of others. Like has this happened to a family member? and were they able to come back from it? When this happens could it become permanent? Or is it like a cycle of vescular dementia? 

What have the later stages been like? And what symptoms have you seen towards the end?

My family doesn't want surprises, its been very very difficult, If its a cycle, its not like we're not going to call an ambulance based on responses of Reddit. But I don't really know what the worst can be. what do we really expect towards the end of her life? So we can kind of mentally prepare too. 

Thanks for any response","STRESS, can be really bad (burns through any 'cognitive reserve' a patient with mild cognitive impairment may have).

My mom had vascular dementia, a blood thinner seemed to help, somewhat (but of course has its own risks such as intestinal bleeding).

Vitamin B12 (methyl cobalamin) tablets under the tongue clearly helped clear her mind and memory, modestly.

I cared for her & my dad (both suffering from dementia in their final years) for over a decade, and both have now passed well over a decade ago.  I've since done considerable research on dementia (as, I'm also approaching 'that' age), seeking ways to slow/stop a likely deterioration.  

I've concluded:  good gum care (dental hygiene, to reduce 'gum pockets' and the resultant inflammation which spreads to the brain), and, an excellent diet (8 servings or more of vegetables & fruits per day is desireable, or at least a small glass of concord grape juice and some turmeric spice daily), would imo give someone a fighting chance of notably reducing their odds of getting dementia.  It may even slow down established dementia's progression, at least in mild cases.
I believe the theories that in dementia, they have dreams, that are little disturbed be inputs from real world soghts, smells, or sounds.  Accept their reality, and respond within it.",2022-02-10 17:43:05,spandextampon,spiqw8
Dementia,Are You Helping Friends with Parents Who Have Dementia After You Own Experience?,"After my experience with my dad who passed from dementia related issues last year.  One of my best friends told me that his mother has been diagnosed with dementia. 

I feel very much compelled to help him because I don't him to go through the problems that I had with my father.  However, in my case I had to deal with my stepmother and half brother.  So my friend has gotten Medicaid for his mother, a Power of Attorney, Healthcare Proxy, and a home aide for his mother.  All which I told him about and he heeded my advice. 

Unfortunately with my father. He never had an aide. No Power of Attorney, only Legal Guardianship which was a pain in the backside. No Healthcare Proxy. No Medicaid.  This was very hard on us. 

So I feel compelled to help those when I hear they have family members recently diagnosed with dementia.","Yes it makes me want to shout to the high heavens. Reinventing the wheel with all the legal and financial matters, medicaid waiver, and all paperwork is massively stupid while you’re also managing the day to day crises. My grandmother is the patient, thank god my parents (already a bit older than average) are still super sharp. I hope all this suffering can let me make my friends lives better when their parents become ill. I see these stories of barely retired dementia patients in their 60s or even 50s, that makes me want to cry
Yes, I help a few elders with dementia, in addition to my mother (who's in excellent health).  It's so isolating, and there's no rule book or instruction manual, each person has to flail around to see what works.  So I offer to share my experience to help.
Yes, absolutely. There isn't a manual for how to deal with all this and finding someone who knows what to do or what services are available is so valuable. 

Another thing that would have been useful is occasionally having people visit and help around the house. I wouldn't mind giving a friend an evening off if I could or making dinner for the family. We weren't able to get this kind of help because of the pandemic and we also don't live near other family, so we ended up so burnt out by the time we moved him to memory care.
This post probably doesn't need a NSFW tag.

Good on you, OP, for offering your experiences and wisdom to a friend. So often you end up not knowing what you need to know until too late -- you did them a real favor helping them to know what to look into.

Dementia,Nutrition and Dementia,Do any of you have a LO that was a vegan and got Alzheimer’s or dementia?,"My Aunt has been a vegetarian for a long time.  She has dementia/alzheimers as did her 2 late brothers and my mum.

My mum is not vegetarian.  She did however love following (and answering) quizzes and doing crossword and other  puzzles.  And she was very good at them too.

..and yet, here we are...:'(
No loved ones who were.  I do know of a man who was a vegan for decades and suddenly had dementia symptoms.  His B12 levels were very low and his mental function normalized when he was given B12.

A plant based diet is better for the heart and blood vessels so it would make sense it would help the brain as well.  I would like to see data on rate of dementia in those following plant based diets.
I wish it was that simple to protect oneself from dementia. I feel that diet and lifestyle is probably a significant factor for vascular dementia as this is linked to high blood pressure and/or diabetes, both of which are affected by diet and lifestyle. 

Generally older people get dementia and younger people are more likey to follow plant based diets so maybe any strong link will become clearer over time (as next generation age).
My mother-in-law was a vegetarian/close to vegan since the mid-1980's at least.  She was a healthy weight. She had a college education and worked in medical labs until she retired, at which point she started a lab consulting business. She exercised regularly, didn't smoke, rarely drank alcohol. She decided to learn to play the violin in her 70's and became quite proficient. She was a gardener. She was a sailor who spent weekends on her Sunfish.  She was a talented seamstress who could do the most intricate tailoring. She is 93 years old and doesn't have any health problems. Has all of her teeth. 

She has vascular dementia.  She can't read music anymore. She can't thread a needle. She can't do the simplest child's puzzle. She doesn't remember that she used to sail and doesn't recognize that the picture of a woman sailing a Sunfish on a lake is her.

I don't think it makes a damn bit of difference how well you take care of yourself, except that the healthiest people will get to live with dementia longer.
Bredesen protocol… highly recommends a keto diet. Also, look up “coconut oil and dementia— Newport. “
Low fat diets that were popular in the 80’s, etc seem to have created some issues.",2022-02-09 18:47:15,Puzzleheaded_Trip229,sorlts
Dementia,Presentation of food at mealtimes,"Just out of curiosity, who here has been trained to cut food up before bringing it to the table, and who has been trained to cut it up at the table in front of the resident (and their neighbours)?

I have been told that cutting it up away from the table protects the person's dignity and makes it less obvious to nearby residents that the individual needs their food to be different. Other people have been told that it's better to cut the food up in front of them so they can see it while it looks ""normal"" and not just a ""pile of mush"".

What have you been trained to do, and why?","My dad likes to cut his own stuff.  And boy does he cut it.  He cuts his meals into these tiny pieces.  I play Paul Harvey for him on my laptop while he eats and we end up going through about 3 shows by the time he gets done eating
I cut it up ahead of time.  My dad actually lives on his own but forgets to cut his own food up sometimes.  So i bring him foood i cooked for him in boxes he can microwave at meal times, sometimes on his own.  He remembers how to microwave but not to cut food sometimes.

If i were you, id just try both and see what the reaction is of the person who has dementia.  Then do whichever one seems more suited for him.  I think different people can actually react differently.
I cut my mother's food very small.  If it's too big, she can't/won't eat it.  

I do it before I bring her food to her, it's easier in the kitchen.

(We're in the same home, not in ""group"" assisted living.)

She no longer has the dexterity to cut her own food up, plus she's on blood thinners so we don't want her around knives.
In school, for becoming a HCA, I was taught to cut it in front of the residents while they’re at the table to eat. I think the reasoning is so that they see it’s being cut, and it functions as a cue for them to eat. That’s how it’s usually done where I am. It just depends on the individual, really.

Oh yeah, and it’s seen as a sort of social interaction, too, between the care giver and the resident. You cut the food, you tell them what it is (really try and sell it if they are fussy), and you talk to them while they eat. That kind of thinking.
CNA here. We are now trained to present the dish to them, then cut it up. It’s about maintaining their dignity and rights as an individual, they don’t get presented cut up mush when others at the table get a nicely plated meal. Of course you ask if they’d like it cut up before you do, even if they’re non verbal.
This discussion is so important. My mom's nursing home insisted on serving pureed food because my mom choked one time. The food there was pretty horrible and pureed is was unbearable. mom screamed and fought the spoon. Then they suggested 'calm down' drugs.

We had to convince the doctor that the risks of choking were small compared to her being 'tortured' evey day.
I cut my grandmother’s food up in the kitchen. It’s just easier and she doesn’t have to wait for me or feel like she needs to try and do it. She struggles to keep food from falling off the plate edge, so I have a barrier that attaches to her plate and it would also make it awkward to cut at the table.",2022-02-09 11:44:55,SmallLumpOGreenPutty,sohz2i
Dementia,Namenda Increased Dosage Causing More Confusion,"My dad has mild dementia and was prescribed Namenda/Memantine 5mg twice a day for 3 months. He tolerated the medicine well without any side effects so the neurologist increased his dosage to 10mg twice a day. His paranoia and memory are much worse since starting the increased dosage.

We let his doctor's office know today...they will let us know how to proceed, but I wanted to ask on here if anyone has had similar observations after dosage increases.

Update: his doctor got back to us today and advised to stop the medicine completely for three weeks to see if the enhanced confusion was a side effect.","Yeah, I remember my mother having to stop it. I think it increased her confusion. She was pretty far along in the disease by the time she started taking meds though.
Yes. The first round of Memantine made grandma very anxious and paranoid. It helped very little with her memory, but the side effects were way worse. Also caused constipation which made her irritability even worse. We ended up stopping it.

Her memory care facility tried again about a year later and it basically had zero effect. I don't believe she's on it now.
Mild dementia should not be treated with namenda. It is not useful.

That med's pretty harsh imo, some 50+ side effects listed [here](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/namenda-side-effects.html)

Have you got him eating/drinking healthy nutrition?  

He's only at the mild stage, might not be too late to slow it down or halt it.  Some of my healthy living tips are mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s4ldm7/my_mom_is_only_56_and_has_dementia/)",2022-02-08 17:02:03,SARcasm30,snw6at
Dementia,Resettling my Dad,"My Dad was removed from his facility two weeks ago and has been in the hospital since. He is moving into a new facility because his old one decided they didn’t want him back due to his irritability and aggression. The hospital didn’t have any issues with him, despite having to keep him to his room, something he hates. But we are moving on to better things, I hope. 

My question is, how I can help him settle into a new place? He isn’t orientated to space and time at all, so he won’t remember his old place at all, but he will know he is in a new place that isn’t “home.” Of course I’m bringing his things, photos, his guitar, and what not. But is there anything else I can do except be there?","Meals -- any favourite / customary foods?  Especially breakfast.

This is something facilities sometimes ask, knowing it makes a difference to newcomers to see familiar food instead of totally strange offerings (on top of all else).

Sigh!  After a week or two, he'll be getting the same old slop everyone else gets.
Snacks, a lot of them!  And gifts abs visits as much as possible.  A lot of hugs for him and for you.
My mother was first moved to a large retirement complex with wide halls and lots of space. It confused her worse and she kept getting lost. We moved her to a smaller apartment with less hall space etc. It helped immensely. She's still upset that she isn't home and she insists that she's going to buy another car and drive again but she's less confused than she was with a ""too spacious"" facility. There's nothing you can really do to ease his fear (and yes he is afraid) except be there. We don't argue with Mom because it just doesn't work and it upsets her further. Remember that when it gets to that point they've lost everything and now they are losing their memories.",2022-02-08 16:25:59,Adverbage,snvbn3
Dementia,My Mom and her Dirty Shirt,"My mom was the cleanest person ever. She kept her house spotless. She now won't change her shirt for anything. I have begged, pleaded, blocked her from leaving the room (not one of my finer moments I must admit), cried, screamrf (again not my finest moment) and bargained. I might as well talk to a wall. I explained to her that she can have the shirt back once I wash it. Hubby says pick my battles. This is a pretty disgusting battle. The CNA didn't have any better luck than I did. I'm over it. I feel like crying over a dirty shirt but it won't do any good.","I hear you!  I picked my battles.  If we were going somewhere and she'd see relatives, or I couldn't put a coat over it, I'd bring over a brand new shirt.  Now this could get expensive but was helpful if we were going to a family gathering.  I would also ""borrow"" some of her favorite clean clothes, bring them home with me and then bring them back.  I'd pull the borrowed shirt out of a shopping bag and with a flourish, exclaim, ""Look Mom!  I bought you this pretty blue shirt!  Isn't it nice!  Don't you like it?  Try it on!""  She'd happily model her new clothing and I'd compliment her generously.  Since Mom has dementia, she wouldn't recognize the borrowed shirt as her own.  I wish you luck!  It is upsetting when they were so particular and now have stained clothing.
See if she'll ""Try on this top to see if it fits"" and when she does that then distract her ""Oh! You look really nice in that can I take a photo to show *hubby sister, cousin insert loved one here*"" then quietly take the other shirt away.
It avoids confrontation, you're filling in a need for the person to be useful, ""You're really helping me by trying this on!"" It can sometimes work a little better than the head on route.
Perhaps spot clean it while she's wearing it?  I find that the more emphasis I place on a behavior the more they fight me on it.  I suggest that you grit your teeth and ignore the shirt for a day or two then ask if you can sponge a spot or two off.  See how she reacts.
I hear you. I so hear you. I once had my dad scream, ""YOU'RE TRYING TO MURDER ME!"" and took a bunch of swings at me when I...tried to change his shirt. He'd worn the shirt for over a week. It stank to high heaven and was covered in food stains. But by gum he was NOT changing it and wasn't letting anyone else change it, either, and attempts to change it would be regarded as literal murder.

I don't know why they do this, but man, is it frustrating every time they do.
It sounds like a security blanket. Can you get identical shirts so she'll always have one on?

She won't get sick from a dirty shirt.  The worst that will happen is that others will judge her.  And who really cares about that?  She doesn't, obviously.
In the middle ages, they called dementia ""The Second Childhood"", because some people seem to regress to a childlike stage. The same tricks and ploys we use with kids, can be applied to dementia patients. It's easier.
I work in aged care. I have a few people I look after like that and we have to find something that makes them want to change. One lady refuses to shower, just tells us that she has. Definitely hasn’t and goes off at us when we disagree. So we figured out that she’ll do almost anything, including showering voluntarily when we tell her that we will take her to the Bank. Not sure why but it’s what  she’s has fixated on and it works every time wouldn’t fail. Maybe try and find her ‘bank’
Does she sleep in it? Does she shower or bathe in it? Surely there's some opportunity to nab and clean it.
Totally understand the frustration when wanting them to just be clean because of the health benefits emotionally and physically we feel as humans. Alot of times when the most difficult ones I helped, I have throughly explained what I do with each step and always say let's put this in the laundry because of etc etc. And at times I can give a tough love approach by saying your family wouldn't want to have anything dirty on your nice clothing to ruin the fabric. I know alot of that generation REALLY takes care of all belongs especially clothing. Not saying it's fool proof but has helped most of the time and personally in the end, those patients trusted me more and I know are happy that ive helped them. ❤️❤️ Totally gets my heart when they say thank you or thank you for helping me.
Oof solidarity.  

Lil bit different here.  Mom keeps asking for new clothes and then only actually wearing the biggest shirt she can find over and over.  It happens to have some weird adhesive from a weird flexible foam price tag stuck on the front so we can't just sneak in other ones.  She wants the one with the random chunk of foam on it and no others.
My mother have a white dress that she loves and never put it off, I know what you feel. I'm trying to find similar clothes for her, but I'm grateful that she is accepting to change at least her underwear.   
Sending you a virtual hug, stranger. I'm in a tough time too and saw your post.
STRESS for those with dementia is Not good for them.  Doesn't do others much good either imo.
Can she bathe with her shirt on? Soap it up, rinse it out, it's clean. Squeeze or press water out of it with a thick towel, sit her in a warm place, and it will dry in the air, sped along by her body heat.
Unfortunately you have to take it off of her. Is anyone bathing her? Changing her pants?
I find myself with a calm, happy and positive attitude and it is nearly always returned the same way. When i tried telling my dad what to do he would only become defiant. I suggest things now, do you want to? Or will we go do this? I know i am so very lucky that my dad is happy in his condition and this might be no use to people struggling but if you can remove your own feelings and stay happy for your loved one, it might help.",2022-02-08 12:00:14,beepbop21,snp08l
Dementia,Writing dementia from the perspective of someone suffering from dementia.,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I hope this is a proper place to ask a question like this. I've been researching dementia for some time now, for a writing project. The project itself is written from third-person, from the perspective of several different characters. However, one of these characters is suffering from nerve cell death in their brain for a number of different reasons, and warning signs of early-onset dementia are making themselves present. Everything that I've read about regarding dementia is usually from a third person (even in journalistic form), so I'm having difficulty trying to imagine what it is like to actually \*have\* dementia, making it difficult for me to write from this particular character's perspective. I feel like it would be a little cliche to just go off symptoms as viewed from the third person (I.E. character finds character suffering from dementia wandering around, lost, having forgotten where they are or what they were doing). For example, there is a sequence where the character awakens--as told from their perspective--having forgotten who they are and where they live, but because it's early-onset, the episode doesn't last terribly long before they suddenly have mental clarity and realize who they are and where they are.

&#x200B;

Can anyone explain what it's really like to \*live\* with early-onset dementia? What are these episodes of ""forgetfulness"" actually like, from the perspective of someone actually suffering from the disease? Is it just like that--an episode? Where somebody loses touch of their own reality for a period of time before suddenly ""remembering""? It sounds a little silly, describing it like that, but that's why I'm here asking this question, because I'd like it to not be a silly depiction. I'm also open to any reading material if anyone has any recommendations.

&#x200B;

Many thanks","My grandmother had early on-set dementia when I was a boy growing up but she sadly passed away in 2015. She was an incredible, elegant woman with so much love and strength until it all unravelled away over the years. When I was around 10 she became very hostile, confused and angry and eventually over the years she became hollow. 

Have you seen 'The Father'? I'd say that's a great portrayal of dementia, at least in film.
Frustration, you can see it in their every thought early on in the disease. They try to grasp at concepts and memories they can no longer process. Perhaps in the beginning of the narrative they can voice their train of thought and ideas fairly well but as they go on the Frustration builds past confusion and turns to resentment/anger. This is increasingly apparent as the day moves on and energy levels begin to dip. Sundowning could also play an interesting part in your work.
Tru here from the Northern California Redwood Coastline.  My symptoms are associated with Lewy Body Dementia & Vascular Dementia; I am not yet 65yo.  I can no longer drive, cook, babysit, bathe myself without help, etc, and audio communication is more difficult than written conversation for me, but decline has continued more than 20yrs, so is still slow enough that doctors continue calling it ""Mild Cognitive Impairment"". Very involved in Blogging about Symptoms and STRATEGIES, Dementia Mentors, Family History, and Art.

Not dementia exactly, but you might look at Benjy in *The Sound and the Fury,* William Faulkner, 1929, available free. Benjy is cognitively disabled, and narrates chapters of the work first person. Available free here: https://fb2bookfree.com/fiction/1156-the-sound-and-the-fury.html

Also Faulkner's *As I Lay Dying,* 1930. Nobody with cognitive disabilities (sort of), but a tour de force of first person narrators who are illiterate, but have rich interior lives. 

Probably other Faulkner, but these are two I'm most familiar with. Worth looking up Sparknotes, or something similar, if this your first encounter; you'll need a roadmap.
I'd suggest reading The Neuroscientist Who Lost Her Mind by Barbara K. Lipska. A true story of a scientist who experienced many of the same symptoms as dementia due to brain cancer. She recovered and was able to recall the confusion and forgetfulness. It is all explained heartbreakingly from 1st person viewpoint.

It really helped me with dealing with my MIL and understanding her struggles.
“Barney’s Version” by Mordecai Richler does this in a slow burn sort of way. It starts slow but pulls it all together in the end.
It's going to vary somewhat from person to person.  For my wife, she was in complete denial that she had dementia.  Everything she said and did that demonstrated her dementia made complete sense to her.  She never knew anything was ""off.""  (Probably still doesn't).  

As an example:  We had gone out to dinner one day and an older couple sat across from us at a table.  (This was a couple of years ago, so I was about 60 and she about 64 at the time; the older couple probably in their late 70s or in their 80s.)

My wife looked over at the older couple and became convinced that it was her dad and her aunt.  (Her mother died when she was fairly young, so her dad and his sister were together quite often).  However, her dad had been dead for 25 years at this point.  I mentioned that to her to try to get her to realize that she was wrong.  She would even talk often about her dad dying at the local hospital which we drove by frequently.  (He didn't die there, but he had been admitted there before his death).  She admitted that she remembered that he had died and remember the funeral and where he was buried.  But was still convinced he was now sitting across from us having dinner.  

It was all I could do to get her to not get up and go over and talk to him.  

In her case, she would never ""suddenly remember"" or ""suddenly realize"" that her thinking had been completely wrong.  She would always remain convinced that her world was real and accurate, no matter how absurd it would seem to the rest of us.

I should mention that my wife has Frontal-Temporal dementia, which affects judgement and thinking more than memory, so her memory generally remained fairly good, but her interpretation of the world around her would consistently worsen.  She often would see a total stranger and if there was any remote resemblance to someone she knew, she would be convinced it was that person.  Any mini-van she saw, she believed was our daughter's and her husband's mini-van, even though they lived 3 hours away from us.  Any white car was my white car.  

Times also threw her.  If she took a nap in the afternoon, even for 15 or 20 minutes, she would be convinced that she had slept all night long on the couch and wondered why I didn't wake her and get her to bed. I could be 3 in the afternoon and the sun shining, and she would be convinced it was 3 in the morning (or that the clocks were wrong).

Hope this helps.  Ask me anything if you want to know more.
I care for my grandma and she has progressed but I do remember some of the things from early onset.
Side note- she suffers from Vascular dementia.

I can think of at least one clear example. When my grandma could still drive (2018-ish) she left our home and went to church. She got home at her usual time and I asked her how it was. She told me she never made it there. She got lost and came home. She has lived in the area for 30+ years and luckily knows most of the main roads well. She told me she didn't want to drive anymore and gave me the keys. 

Another example is losing her place while reading. She loved to read but I think could not remember where she left of even with a book mark. She began to underline the sentences. That way she knew where she was. So she had books that were just full of lines. 

Giving up complicated tasks (like using the computer) for simple things. Insisting she had changed clothes when she had not. Things like that.",2022-02-08 11:57:13,LevRaskolnikov,snoxge
Dementia,"The starting signs of dementia, what are they?","My grandmothers memory has been deteriorating for a while now but recently she has started forgetting a lot of conversations we've had and I'm starting to think she's forgot my visits too. She angry with me all the time, thinks I'm doing nothing to help her but I've been supporting her a lot. She's scared, I understand that but its heartbreaking knowing she is so angry when I'm trying my best. It's just me and her and I'm so out of my depth. We're no where near her needing to go in a home but she says she never wants to and I can just move in with her. But I know there will come a day I can no longer handle it by myself. I'm terrified of the future and I'm worried it's more than just bad memory due to her age.","Memory issues,  anger,  frustration all sound like early stages but it could be other things too so you need a proper diagnosis.

So first stage get a proper diagnosis. If it is dementia there are many different types and all have different behaviours associated with them. 

Second step,  once you know it is dementia and what type start researching all you can. Forewarned is forearmed as the old people say. 

Third step find out what support you can get. I don't know what country you are in I'm sure there are charities all over the world that you can call and they will point you in the direction of best kinds support. You will need practical support like respite care, maybe carers coming in to do stuff like bathing,  toileting etc. And you'll want to take any financial help on offer,  for example carer's benefit (I'm using our English system as an example). It's not much money but it will help pay for fuel or buses to go visit etc so helping her doesn't cause a financial strain as well as the physical and emotional strain it will cause sadly.


And the two most important things. 1. If you have to take this on, make sure you have a support network as you will be frustrated/angry/sad/confused so you will need people to vent to. There are support networks for carer's everywhere,  please look into them. 2. Make sure you take time for yourself. This is absolutely essential. You need time away from the stress just to recharge your emotional battery and make sure your own life is under control. If you try and care for her while you are stressing about what you haven't done at home or are tired and drained you will soon start to feel the strain. If you aren't healthy and happy in yourself you aren't in the best place to be looking after someone else. So please please look after yourself.

Dementia,Can an burn injury cause someone with early dementia to suddenly get worse?,"My dad caught his pants on fire a few days ago and burned a good part of his upper right thigh and abdominal area. Ever since he got home from the ER (they just patched him up and sent him home. It took less than 2 hours with an ambulance and Uber back) he’s very confused and he keeps asking me where my mom is, he doesn’t want to eat, keeps getting undressed or trying to leave to “go home” and stuff. Before he burned himself, he was able to eat, drink, remember that he lives with sister, watch TV and so on like usual. He knew reality. My sister said it’s been about a year since he was this confused. 

Can an injury cause this? Should we be concerned?","There is something called hospital delirium. Or the burn wound may be infected. Test for a UTI too.
Of course it can!  It'll be like he's in shock, which he likely is.

ANY serious stress can burn out the 'cognitive reserve' of an MCI (mildly cognitively impaired) patient, and throw them for a loop.  The up side is that at least his exposure to medical 'care' was brief.

Could take weeks or months to fully recover their earlier capabilities, and might not make it all the way back.

This is not the time for fresh challenges, please try to ease up on any further stress experiences.
As above. In my experience memory loss is worse when the sufferer is stressed, for any reason. Even a different location or a change of routine can be stressful for them.
Burns are no joke. You didn’t say what degree he had or what % of his body was affected. Make sure he is drinking plenty of liquids. Dehydration is a big part of burn injuries. Burns can quickly dehydrate and that can cause all sorts of problems. Plus burns can be crazy painful as they heal and nerve endings start to come back. Make sure the you help him follow the instructions with the ointments, bandages etc so they’re kept clean and hydrated. Plus burns are super traumatic. Hopefully with some rest and healing he’ll be back to his baseline, and won’t be so confused. I’m sorry you’re all going through this. Hugs.
I'm sorry about your Dad.  And any kind shock or traumatic event can worsen dementia.  It may only be a temporary setback.

Proper care is so important here, is he getting home care?  Showering and personal care are going to be hard for a while.
Trauma can make things worse. My grandma’s death made it very clear that there was something wrong with my Dad and his memory. He just wasn’t the same after that.
My dad went to the hospital twice last year in the span of 2 months, once for 3 nights, once for just one night.  After both visits he got significantly worse and has not recovered, it only accelerated his condition.  

The second time he had a nurse call my mom in the middle of the night asking where she was because he thought he was at home in his bedroom and was confused why she wasn't there too

&#x200B;

Sucks big time
Any kind of traumatic and/or stressful experience can make their condition worse, and lead to even more confusion than normal.
any inflammation can intensify our symptoms dramatically, and so can trauma.  >> [https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/03/31/tied/](https://truthfulkindness.com/2021/03/31/tied/) .",2022-02-08 00:11:24,Justcurious_side,snbvd0
Dementia,“I can’t hear you.” on the phone often instead means “I can’t understand you.”,,"OP here. The above is the truth for my 92 year old mother with dementia. In trying to explain a complicated insurance issue my mom started complaining she could t hear me. I tried slowly shouting. She still claimed she couldn’t hear me even though she had been able to before we got into the insurance issue.

I had my brother call on the same issue since he was the primary one handling it. By speaking extra slowly and simply Mom could “hear” him.
Hearing is hardware + software (ears + brain).  If either's in bad shape, it becomes a challenge.

It greatly helps if the speaker is:  familiar, speaks clearly, and slowly.  Being able to see the speaker's mouth can be helpful (an intuitive form of lip reading supplements poor 'hearing/interpreting' speech).
I hear you!    Same, my 89 yr old mum, I have to simplify so many things, often leave out many details. 

 Sometimes even simple statements, if it's a different topic than what her brain is on, she won't get it,  just looks completely utterly lost.  Or, thinks she's understood something you've said about her topic, says 'yes, yes, isn't it!' when I can see she has no clue of what I've actually said.     I have to back up, give context to change her over to the new topic, & start again.  Then she gets it no worries.  

 I would not even attempt to explain complicated insurance thing.  We had exactly this case recently, actually, with some home-insurance claim for storm damage.  I just told her - we're sorting out the claim, they want photos & details for their LOT OF SILLY RED TAPE, it's being processed, they'll let us know.  She seemed happy with that.  It would have been frustrating & futile to spend all that time trying to explain the details.   

Good on you OP, a very valid observation!
I sometimes break up conversation into short sentences or a couple sentences and then pause. Wait for it to sink in and then start the next sentence. Almost like speaking through a translator. Very challenging getting the cadence right but it helps reduce how many times I have to repeat things and I think it help improve understanding.
This is one of the biggest challenges my family faces.  Dad is so deaf that if you're standing next to him in a quiet room, you hear your voice (with a slight delay) coming from his properly installed hearing aid.  I live half the country away, so most of our contact is via telephone.  

On his good days, communication is good and we can talk for almost an hour.  On bad days, he can't figure out how to use his phone, can't line up the speaker with the hearing aid (it needs to be right over the mic), or has real trouble understanding us even if he can hear.  If his hearing gets much worse (likely given family history), the isolation will be horrible for him, since he never learned ASL and cannot now.
Yes; there can be a big difference between hearing and understanding.  Floating Words

Dementia,Both my grandparents have severde dementia and just wont go to sleep,"It happens every night now, my grandmother keeps trying to stand up, but she cannot since she cant support her own weight, so we have to lift her up many times throughout the day. This isnt an easy task for me or my mother, since grandma is also obese.

She doesnt believe that the house shes lived in for the last 15 years is hers to be in, and she keeps asking to go to the house of dead relatives. 

Both of them refuse to believe that they have eaten dinner, or lunch, or any time in the last week, even though i know they ate. Every night is a bunch of yelling from grandma who is sitting on the ground telling grandpa to help her stand up.

I really wish they both could pass away painlessly, our life would improve so much.

My house is constantly filled with yelling, by grandma or my mother, who absolutely despises the fast that grandmother own children are waiting for them to die to claim any sort of property from them, while she is there to clean and deal with the craziness dementia brings.","My mother also had trouble. Her doctor suggested I give her melatonin. I started at 2.5 and increased about every 5 days to find how much she needed. 7.5 was what worked for her. I would give it to her about 10 minutes before we got ready for bed. It took a while to wash and dress for bed. I also kept the house light until dinner. Then I began slowly cutting off lights. We had a routine and followed it religiously. This helped get her to bed. As the dementia progressed she slept more like a baby -short naps throughout the day and night. Good luck. It’s hard. I know.
We only had to deal with mom.  Dad was ok.  In the AM we turned on all the lights and opened windows.  Think DAYTIME!!.  And we tried to keep her engaged and interested in things throughout the day. When she got agitated we would just start looking at pictures with her or remind her of her own parents or talk about grandchildren or play music.  Anything other than disagree with her.  Around 8 PM she got her melatonin and we would start darkening the house.  We turned down music, dimmed the lights, etc.  We would literally start pretending to yawn.  Then at about 10 PM it was a potty trip and bedtime.  She usually got up a couple times per night but we would only whisper and wouldn’t turn on lights when we had to help her.  Curiously, once she finally went into memory care and was on a regular diet and had somebody watching her meds more closely, she got on a better schedule than when she had been at home.  Hang in there, at some point this will be behind you
Are you seeing a general practioner physician, or a geriatric specialist or neurologist? Because a general practioner will prescribe something for anxiety or psychiatric behavior.  A specialist may be able to get you something to put them to sleep.

From my own experience. We saw a general practioner for my dad.  They gave him melatonin and some basic stuff. Dad wouldn't sleep.  Or only slept for like 4 hours.  My cousins saw a specialist for my aunt and uncle. Gave them meds that gave them 8 to 10 hours of sleep.
Yikes! I am so sorry this is happening with your family. I can't imagine the amount of stress you all are under every single day. Is it possible to get them placed in a facility?  If not, can you bring in outside help a few hours a day or week in order to give everyone a break? Your Mom should also contact their doctors to see if there is a medication which would help to calm things down.  This disease is torture for all involved. Contact your local senior center, they may have resources which could help.  Good luck.",2022-02-07 17:11:30,taqiftqeninanen,sn2kvi
Dementia,Home aide Background Check,We're considering hiring an in home aide that doesn't work through an agency. We've never completed a background check and we're looking for any feedback on the process. Do we need just the SSN and DOB from the aide? what information can we obtain? We are in NY btw.,"Get references and check them. Including people or the families of people they took care of before.
If you're in the US, check out [care.com](https://care.com). It's a popular site to hire private caregivers and they take care of background checks if the caregiver agrees. I've used them and so have other people I've met in my support group. The bigger headache with hiring private is withholding and paying taxes. This takes time and work and that's why some people feel it's worth it to hire an agency instead.
Get a rent application to see how consent for a 'credit check' is done.  But you may need an agency to process a credit check.  Or, sit beside them and get them to do their own credit report online while you watch (& offer to reimburse them for the online fee, vs the free approach which takes weeks by snail mail).

eg. Equifax & TransUnion & some other outfit I've forgotten.

Credit checks can provide invaluable background about someone.

And then, there are 'criminal record checks', typically done through your local police station for you, I think.  You certainly don't want to expose your loved one to a criminal, right?  Doubtless there'll be a fee, ought to be reasonable, though.  Could take days or weeks for them to get around to it.",2022-02-07 10:16:51,HaroldBAZ,smslcj
Dementia,person with dementia throwing away important things,"Sorry I dont know where to go for question, i don’t understand dementia. im 17 and was adopted by a now 82 year old with dementia. 

Hes throwing away my birth certificate, my driving permit, my social security, some physical records, and even my entire adoption book that told me everything about my biological family. 

he isnt mad at me, he doesnt hate me. why is he doing this and is there anything i can do to stop this? i dont live with him anymore but i was told by someone in his house that he did all that and isnt even explaining why. i cannot bring important stuff like that with me to keep safe right now. i have to go through the process of proving my identity now to get everything back.

he did this same thing a few years ago when his grandson passed, he lived in the house and as soon as he passed, he started throwing away everything in his room in trash bags after everyone had discussed to keep it the same.

his wife is having her important stuff found in the trash and some are even gone for good like physical bank records and her other important pieces of paper like some that are medical. 

thought about hiding these things and locking them up, but his wife is old too and cant move far so it wouldnt be fair to make her go through the extra trouble of hiding things when shes done or unlocking it all the time. is this a thing with dementia? is it common they throw away things that aren’t even theirs? he doesn’t throw away his trash but doesnt have a problem throwing away legal papers.

either are at a point where they need in house care or nursing home. every time i mention dementia people reply with nursing home but that is not nice. he can do basic things on his own still, hes just a bit odd with behaviors like this. the one thing i cant seem to get around. he refuse to get help for his dementia. he is diagnosed but has refused to get tested again to see the progression. is there a way to persuade someone with dementia not to do these behaviors?","Try someone throwing away their own power of attorney document. They literally destroyed their own guard against dementia.
Yup, my dad throws away everything needed (SS card, birth certificate, bills, proof of identity, proof of car ownership, etc.) and saves absolute trash and crap in all his drawers. 

Beyond frustrating, most times I just want to know “what’s going through your head when you think this isn’t necessary documentation but this receipt from Walmart from 5 years ago is vital to our lives?”
Dementia is not just the loss of memory it’s the loss of reasoning and almost every function . It’s a 24 hr job to keep an eye on them. be proactive and remove things you don’t want lost or ruined.
I feel this post. 

The only thing I can recommend is to ensure that the person with dementia is not left on their own. Then behaviour like this can be redirected or addressed. It is not easy and I’ve had my share or arguments when doing this. 

I would feel the same hesitancy about a care home. 
However, a companion worker in the home or an adult day care may help even just a few hours a week to provide some supervision and respite. 

The other issue is the family members that are caregivers end up burned out and need respite so while his wife might be around most of the time she might also be burnt out and need her own supports. 

I hope your able to replace what you are able to that was thrown out.
Hi OP, first I’d like to say I am very happy you submitted in this sub. A person as young as you should not have to deal with such a situation. 

I would recommend hiding what is important to you - and him when you have a chance. Distraction is a very good tool….
It's a fairly common behavior. My mom threw away an entire box of checks, then accused everyone who came into the house of stealing them or hiding them.

You might want to ask his wife to mail you anything that was salvaged so it's out of his reach.

As for care, you might want to contact theIr local area council on aging to see if someone can come out and do an evaluation to see if they're safe living as they are or if they need help.
I don’t want to think about what my mom probably threw away in the beginning stages of dementia. 

Good luck with getting your documents secure.

Has a Power of Attorney and Advance Medical directive been established for your parents?   If not, This needs to happen ASAP. Unfortunately you are too young (17 yo, right?) for that designation, so I hope there is another trusted family member who can/has stepped up. Your loved ones are potential targets for financial scamming. 

In addition to the Council on Aging, see if your area has a local Alzheimer’s chapter. They can help with a lot of information.
You’re doing a great job despite how challenging the behaviour is.  Finding solutions is tough because it’s so different for everyone.  Keep reaching out like this, it helps to know how others deal with it too. Best of luck!
There’s just no rational explanation for the way dementia raises its ugly head … my father did some incredibly strange things as the dementia progressed … just roll with it don’t try to place ‘rational’ expiations on ‘irrational’ actions
In my experience you cannot reason with them. At least in my grandma’s case. I could get through to her and then she’d revert right back to the behavior.  She didn’t really learn things anymore. The milestones for someone with dementia are related to the loss of cognitive function. I would expect this to get worse, with ups and downs. 

Dementia aside, I can tell you that a house full of possessions is more and more of a burden as you get old. 

Keeping papers, belongings etc for people who are deceased or out of the house would be a source of stress for me, and I’m only 50 something. 

I understand you’re not in a place where you can take all your belongings right now, but is there someone else who could store it for you temporarily until you can take it?  

It may make more sense to get it out of there rather than try to convince him to stop throwing it away.
Very sorry to hear that. You're in a situation where there are no good choices. Has his wife, adult kid, anyone got him to sign a document allowing them to make decisions on his behalf? In the US we call that POA. Dementia is horrible. You can't reason with it permanently, because it's progressive brain damage. With a little research, you can learn to talk him down from destructive behavior in the moment. But that just buys you time to stop the rampage and save the documents while he rests. Even if you reason with him and he agrees with you in that moment, he won't remember whatever he promised a few weeks ago. And likely he forgets the times that he forgot things, so he doesn't believe anything is wrong with him. You really have to remove everything important from the home, or put them in a lockbox and make copies and digital versions of all documents that you can reference the information, without the original. If nowhere in the home or someone else's home is safe, a safety deposit box at the bank is an option. And then for grandpa, give him low-risk items to ""organize"" so that he can feel like he's doing something ""productive"".
Get a safe deposit box and store your important papers.
My mom throws away everything from toilet paper to pictures of people she doesn't recognize and it's getting worse. Hide everything!!
Are you sure they aren't ""hiding"" them?
Have his wife mail the important documents to you so you for safekeeping
All you can do is put the most important documents in a safe and secure location where they can’t find it and move it or discard it.

My mom used to sign up with horrible Medicare advantage plans where shed end up getting billed after going to the doctor whereas before she wouldn’t get a bill. I guess whoever tried to sell these plans didn’t care as long as they made their sale.",2022-02-07 08:47:27,X7VU,smqmvo

Dementia,Silly things our family members say,"My dad, like many others, goes in and out of being cogent and/or confusing/confused. But one thing he still does is try his hardest to make everything into a joke. It's one of his strongest personality traits that he hasn't lost.  Today, he caught me by surprise when he was lamenting his lack of strength and getting old (he's 72) and still found a way to make it funny:

""I have to bring a pillow to the dinner table now because I don't have a butt anymore.... So if you find my butt anywhere, please bring it to me and slap it back on!""

Anyone have an extra butt lying around he could use?","My Dad was questioning who my mother was.  I was calmly trying to explain to him who Mom was to me.  (Which is an awfully odd thing to have to explain.  ""Well, I've known her my whole life. "")

He sighed and said, ""We're not on the same page.  You're probably on the right page.  I'm not even in the right book. . . ""  Which I thought was pretty witty.
Sweet
Love this
Gotta see the light side of all this. I'd love to lose a bit of my butt, too!
haha. Aww!

I don't have an extra butt, but I have one I'd like to make smaller. I wish I could donate some!

Dementia,Mom is in the ICU.,"2022 has not been a good year for my mother.  In addition to having dementia, she tested positive for COVID about a month ago (I did too).  While in the middle of the two week quarentine she fell and couldn't get up.  I had to call an ambulance for her.  Turns out she fractured a vertabrae in her neck, though fortunately no surgery was required and she work a neck brace for a week.  The doctors felt it would heal on it's own.

Meanwhile, she didn't seem to be recovering from COVID.  I was down a few days and now I'm fine, but she continued to cough, have muscle pain, and was very lethargic.  I thought that since she was older, she was just taking longer to recover.

But she kept deteriorating.  She stopped eating. She didn't want to get up and get dressed, which no matter how bad her dementia might be on a particular day, was still something she insisted on doing every day.  But she got more and more confused and lethargic.  She even quit caring about watching tv, which was something she has really insisted on doing the past couple of years.

On Friday, I kept thinking that things were really wrong.  Just a feeling in my mind that something was off.  And Friday evening, she had a siezure.  I called 911, when they arrived, she couldn't support herself, my sister and I had to hold on to her to keep her from slipping out of her chair to the floor.  She was totally out of it.  She wasn't answering any questions, her blood pressure was extremely low, and then she had another siezure while the EMTs were there.

They took her to the ER and she was diagnosed with sepsis, so they admitted her to the hospital.  Early this morning, she got worse and was moved to the ICU.  She was having trouble breathing so they hooked her up to a machine to help with that. Not a ventilator but something else.  Also, her kiddneys are only working at about 15%.  In addition, she is still really confused, she's pulled out her IV three days now.  And she takes off her hospital gown and pees on the floor.  When she got asked if she thought she was in the bathroom when she peed, she had no memory of doing that.

There is a part of me that hopes she doesn't come home.  Her quality of life has declined some much in the past 10-12 weeks, it just breaks my heart.  My father died back in 2001, so she's been alone for 20 years now.  She's so tired, lonely, and exhausted that I just don't know if I might be better for her go on to whatever is next.","I’m so sorry. Big hug to you.
Talk to the case manager at the hospital and ask about making her ""Do Not Resuscitate"" and terminating life support so she can go peacefully. She's had a hard few years and deserves an easy end. If hospice can be involved that might help too.
Sending you love and strength 💜
2022 has come in like a train off the rails for a lot of us. I'm sorry it's going downhill fast for you. It is never a position we hope to find ourselves in. I hope for peace and clarity during this hard time for you.

What a shitty time of things. I'm so, so sorry.
OH boy, I am so sorry.  2021/2022 has been so hard for dementia sufferers and their families.
That's gotta be so hard for you. And it is so hard to watch someone who is getting no enjoyment out of life. I hope things are going smoothly for you and your mother.",2022-02-06 18:35:30,BlueRFR3100,smb4l4
Dementia,Honest question? Is it bad that I wish my grandparents would just pas away? My grandpa refuses to get my grandma help apparently she has to make the choice to go into the nursing home or get help. I blame my grandpa for allowing my grandma to get bone skinny. They both are not right in the head.,,"Nope. My grandmother had dementia. As my mom now goes through the same journey I reflect back at both my mother and aunt keeping my grandmother alive for whatever reason when they should have let go and let her pass.

There are days that I just want my mom to go quietly in her sleep, however, I have aDNR on her and know when it is her time it is her time. 

Isn’t not bad, you are being rational and don’t want her to suffer
Yes. All the time. My dad has dementia and he would be horrified of the person he’s become. I feel like he’s being tortured every day he’s still alive. I want him to be free and go enjoy the afterlife.
It's not bad at all. It's controversial, but to many of us who have walked this road, it feels selfish to want to keep them around when they're not themselves and wouldn't want to live this way if they had a choice in the matter.

A friend's mom was in the late stages, barely responsive, hadn't recognized anyone in months, scared all the time. She stopped eating. The friend and her father didn't want to lose her so they had a feeding tube inserted, the mom pulled it out, so they restrained her and put it in again to ""save her life"". To me, that would be absolute hell. To them, they were so intent on keeping her alive that they'd force feed her body and tie it down so it couldn't resist it because they ""had"" to keep her around. She died about 4-5 weeks later. While it seemed brutal to me at the time, until my own mom was going through the same thing did it really occur to me how cruel it could be. We opted to let mom just fade away, she said she wasn't hungry, we offered any kind of food we thought she'd like, but didn't try to force her. If we got 2 bites into her it was a victory. Staff kept telling us to expect her to be gone in a week or two, she lasted like that from about a week before Thanksgiving until early January. That last Christmas we all gathered in one of the lobbies and celebrated together, that afternoon it got warm and my sister tossed a blanket around Mom's shoulders and took her outside to just sit and watch the sunset and enjoy the fresh air. She loved it. We had memories that while they weren't ideal weren't traumatic. The friend mentioned later that she wished she'd tried to talk her dad out of it, but at the time she just couldn't handle losing her mom.
It's not wrong. My wish is not for a long life, but for a quick death.
I think it's normal to sometimes wish for them to die if we can't see any other way for their suffering to end.

And it's also normal to feel guilty for having these feelings.  Don't beat yourself up.
Nope. My dad has late(r) stage dementia. Every time the nursing home calls, part of me hopes it's to say that he's dead. He's miserable. His quality of life sucks. Existing in this limbo state where he's basically dead in all the ways that matter but not actually PHYSICALLY dead sucks. I just wish it would end.

So, yeah, totally normal. Please don't feel bad. It's good that you hate seeing your grandparents suffer and want them to not suffer, and if the only way for them to not suffer is for them to pass away, then wishing they'd just get on with it is totally normal and OK.
My dad had dementia; we took care of him for 2 1/2 years 24/7. It was painful to watch him go thru the various stages. They day he died; the mortician moved him from the hospital bed to the body bag. It was then I saw he was truly skin and bones. He had stopped eating totally 2 weeks prior. My heart goes out to you. Have you tried calling Adult Protective Services to get help?

Dementia sucks
It isn’t. It’s very controversial, but your grandmother isn’t your grandmother, in a sense. Physically she is there, of course, and you love her I am sure of it. However, the person she was… her personality, her essence. It’s not there anymore. My grandfather had dementia, it advanced quickly and he passed shortly after. It was difficult and it hurt, but I actually cried more during his advancement with dementia than his actual death. Now my grandmother has it, my brother and I are her caretakers but she is going strong. I have wished this, too, and cried after. It’s frustrating because one doesn’t want to wish these things or feel the way we do. It’s not only that it’s extremely exhausting to take care of them, but you can tell they are miserable. My grandfather once tried to take his own life during his dementia, and my grandmother often wishes she was dead. It sucks. Stay strong.
I feel the same way about my grandmother. She lives in a permanent non stop hell in her mind and there’s not much we can do
It’s normal and okay. I just wish my mom (later stages of dementia) could be free. It feels like she’s tormented every day and this isn’t a life she’d want.
Nope we all feel the same. My mom isn't in the worse stages but just knowing she can't be home alone or take care of herself and that it's only going to get worse makes me wish she'd just go.

Dementia sucks 😔
When my mother died, I had mixed feelings - sad that I will miss her but happy that her stress is over!
No…my parents did not make a realistic plan for the end of life care.  Grateful they only needed full time care for 4 months.  It seemed like eternity. I got off easy.
There are things worse than death
My grandma passed away from Lewy body dementia coming up on two years next month. The weight loss is no ones fault. It happens in the later stages of the disease. My grandmas husband tried so hard to take care of her and keep her at home but eventually had to put her in a special nursing home (him putting in the time to help her or her going to a home wouldn’t have made a single difference). The last time I saw her is when I went to visit her in the nursing home 7 months before she passed (I live in the USA and half the country away) and when I was there visiting her for the day they brought two meals I would have devoured. Spaghetti for lunch and I think it was chicken parm for dinner. I don’t remember 100%, but anyways! She refused to eat those meals (which I tasted and were really good) and claimed we HAD to go to pizza ranch. Which I hadn’t seen one of those in 20 years. She picked up her “phone” and was “calling” basically everyone in her family to meet us at the nearest pizza ranch. Her dead ex husband, my dad and sister who were 1500 miles away to the west coast, my other sister who was 700 miles away to the south East, her son who was hundreds of miles away, my cousins who were your drives away. She was telling me to go get Carl (her husband) from the garage so she could let him know we were about to leave. This was about 4 hours of her going through this and it was almost impossible to get her out of it. Bottom line, she basically just wouldn’t eat anything. I saw a picture of her 4 months later and I almost cried because of how much weight she lost. 3 months later she died. She started dying from starvation and the. ultimately died from dehydration in the same room she begged me to take her to pizza ranch in. The weight loss is not your grandpas fault. It’s something that happens towards the end stages. And when my aunt called me to let me know she passed, I was super sad. I knew for a week what was going on so I prepared myself for it. BUT. When I finally got the official news I collapsed on the couch. My fiancé was right there and she pretty much knew what the call was about and she asked me “how is she?”. I could barely choke the words out “she just died” and two tears rolled down my cheeks. But almost INSTANTLY after saying those words and before those tears reached my chin I was happy. I knew she wasn’t suffering anymore. She knew what she was suffering from and she HATED it. When I left the home she was in that last time, she was pretty upset I was leaving. I told her I had to go and gave her a big hug and as we pulled away from each other she looked me dead in the eye and said “(my name here)... I really hate this place....) and I left immediately and as soon as me and my fiancé got in my car I just broke. I bawled. I didn’t want her in that pain so when she passed I was actually happy about it. Her suffering was done. She could be at peace and I was happy for that. I was a pallbearer and had to carry her a multitude of times for a couple days and I was never really sad during her wake and funeral or anything like that. It wasn’t until I set her on her final resting spot and placed my hand on her casket to say a final goodbye until I lost it. But it wasn’t a cry of sadness, it was a cry of relief for her and a happiness of my memories with her growing up. I was happy her struggle was finally over. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.
My wish for my dad is a long comfortable life and once he is no longer in the shell, we have a DNR for him.  With is multiple medical issues, we're all sure that when he goes deeper into dementia, his body won't take the strain.  At that point, you'd only revive the body and not the personality.  After watching my aunt & uncle go through the hellish latter stages of dementia hell, that's the last thing I want for dad.
It's not bad - it happens.  You don't want them to suffer anymore.  You know they would not want to live like this.  It's sad.  They don't know what they are doing or who any of their family is.
I wished my father would pass away … not for my benefit, but for his … from the time my mother died until he died was 3 very long, painful, depressing, frustrating years … but at its most basic, it was sad watching his mind devolve … granted, we only dealt with it for 3 yrs … can’t imaging dealing with it for a decade or longer
Just like those serious diseases, dementia not only affects the sick people themselves, it frustratingly spills out on the immediate caretaking family too. It takes its toll physically, memtally and financially. 

Personally, death is a merciful angel when it comes to dementia. I even think that most caretakers don't want to say it out loud but *most welcome* too. 😖
I hope not because during her lucid moments my mother has told me she just wants to go and be at peace but can't just will herself to go.  And she is so tired and ready to go.  Heartbreaking knowing how much she is struggling with it, not to mention how tired my dad is.  

I just want whatever brings them both peace.  All three of us are nanometers away from screaming at any given moment now.",2022-02-06 16:16:47,Global_Extent_3407,sm7tno
Dementia,How? How can husbands or wives live without getting the LO help? My grandma has had dementia for 3 years know. She is bone skinny. My grandpa refuses to put her in a facility. She smokes 2 packs of cigarettes a day. He acts like she is normal sometimes. He lives in denial.,,"I don’t get it either. It seems like the older generation has a fear of the dementia diagnosis. I assume it’s the old stigma of mental illness. 

I, on the other hand, was trying to get doctors to listen to me when I knew something was wrong with my husband.  In the early days, I even convinced his GP to do a scan to look for a tumor since my FIL had died of a type of brain cancer that is hereditary. Still, my in-laws don’t seem to see anything amiss with my husband. How can they not see? Well, maybe because I’m convinced (as is my husband) that his mom has a more advanced case of frontotemporal than he has.
Could you possibly call Adult Protective Services?  
They can check the living situation and maybe help your grandfather realize he needs help to care for your grandmother.
Oftentimes they consider nursing homes to be akin to insane asylums where you got locked in and never left or had visitors again. Nowadays if the person doesn’t need that much help, assisted living can be like living in a hotel with a fancy dining room, nice outdoor walking area, cleaning service, pill dispensing, and then getting help bathing a couple times a week.
From what I saw, it came down to a combination of factors:

* Fear of change (don't want to leave home)
* The stigma of living in a facility
* The stigma of needing constant help (farmers, what can I say)
* Denial (We can cope)
* Not sharp enough to see all the problems
* Not wanting to lose freedom
* Not wanting to live with ""old people"". (Sigh)

The combination meant they didn't seriously consider a move to assisted living a decade ago when they were healthier but the house and grounds were too much for them.
Age is cruel. Imagine being a strong independent adult all your life and seeing that slip away. Anger seems like a reasonable emotion. 

This stuff is so tough. I put my mother into aged care 18 months ago. She lived alone and had dementia and was denial even though I’d take her to all her medical appointments where doctors would clearly spell out the diagnosis. So I feel you. But personally, for me,  I would do *anything* to avoid going into aged care. My mum is in a great (expensive!) place but it is still a waiting room for death where you have all your agency taken away from you. There is a narrative that families need to ‘protect’ older people but — and dementia sure complicated the enormously — protect from what? From falling over and dying? I mean once you’re at that stage your fate is death. There is no escaping it. I’d take 12 months of independent living over 10 years in aged care any day. Your grandma is so skinny and smokes two packs of cigarettes a day but so what? Sounds like she is also with the man who loves her in her own home.",2022-02-06 13:53:03,Global_Extent_3407,sm4aw3
Dementia,Dealing With Delusion,"My bride of 50 years has been living with a diagnosis of vascular dementia since 2015. She has been taking memantine since a couple of months before Namenda went off patent, so that’s 6 or 7 years. She recently seems to have progressed stage 5 to stage 6. 

I’m slowly learning to manage the tone of my responses and am trying to remain cheerful. But I am struggling to deal with situations when she becomes delusional. Particularly when she starts gathering clothes and makeup and wants to go to some other “home” that doesn’t exist. I’ve had some success getting her “stay tonight”  but don’t see that as a long term solution. Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: typos


Edit 2: Thanks for all the replies. To date we’ve been largely cruising along for a number of years. Our PCP of course keeps filling the memantine prescriptions (10 mg 2/day), but I suppose we’ve (I’ve) just been waiting for the inevitable. I’ve just recently started to identify community resources since the delusional behavior is new. Before it was just her not remembering - easily manageable. This is a new ballgame. I have reached out electronically this weekend to our PCP, so we’ll see what Monday brings. Thankfully our son has had good luck calming her via FaceTime as he’s 2500 miles away. Again thank you all for the replies.","Do you have anyone that can just visit with her for a while a couple times a week, just so you can go out and unwind a bit? 

Is there a dementia support group that you can talk about your frustrations with? 

If you live in a city that may be day programming she coukd go to for a few hours a couple times a week?

 Do you have a social worker involved that could offer you resources?
I'm so sorry your dealing with this. My mom is the same and I've been dealing with her delusions of her 'being misplaced' for over a year now. 

As the other user suggests, maybe a medication adjustment is needed. There are the supplements they suggest (which I will also consider) but from what I understand, there are also a lot of options for medication. My mom has Lewy Body, so I don't know if it differs med wise from vascular, but in addition to Mementine, my mom takes Donepozil and Risperidone, which is an antipsychotic. She recently had her fourth and final increase of Risperidone and with each increase, it has helped the delusions and aided in better sleep. It has bought us some time. 

Best of luck to you and your wife. 💜
If you haven't already, check out Teepa Snow on YouTube.
One of the things she goes through in detail is how to deal with those requests to go home. One of the things I've seen her suggest is to have a conversation about it with her when she mentions wanting to go home. Ask what she likes best about it. Keep talking and then slowly turn the topic to something safe that she likes. It may be a challenge at first but the discussion will tend to repeat over time so you can learn your lines. 

You definitely should try and get some down time if you can get someone else to stay for a bit and she'll go for it.
I would also recommend seeing the Dr for a medication adjustment. Respiradone and or seraquel has some success in decreasing delusions. Can you look into a Day program she can attend to give you some time for yourself?
My wife went through a pretty strong stage of “wanting to go home” the last couple of years.  I asked who she’d like to go see, where she wanted to go, etc, and sometimes would drive her around. I finally realized that wanting to go home, in her mind, most likely resembled trying to get back to a place that she was at before becoming so confused in her Alzheimer’s, a more comfortable place that she once knew.   
Since she always wanted to wander in the neighborhood (and still does), I decided each time she said go home, I’d unlatch the door and let her go out to walk, get the dog leashed up and walk with her.  She’d eventually get tired and and head back home. We try to walk a couple times a day, so the wanting to go home statements have tapered off quite a bit.
Only memantine? 

Our psychiatrist has the wife on max dosage of memantine 20mg in the morning and max dosage of aricept 10 mg at night.  The 20mg seems to be doing her better. Ramping up from 5mg to 20mg was slow but now seeming to do better.

Additionally, I am giving her Squalene or shark liver oil which studies show ca prevent alzheimers, which the wife has been diagnosed with.

Shark sourced chondroitin 6 which scientific studies suggest improves neural plasticity.

Gingko Biloba which enhances blood flow.

Vitamin D in winter. Now summer in Melbourne, Australia so lots of walks in the sunshine.

Thecwife has had some delusions, but these have subsided with the increase of prescribed drug dosages to max.

Try the supplements like we are doing. If it works, all the better for you.

The reading I have done suggests that the herbal type supplements may work, but only if the active ingredients can pass through the brain blood barrier.

We are trying anything possible and have asked to go on clinical trials for new treatments.

We do not want to lose my wife to dementia in the same way we lost her mother.
So sorry...

Unfortunately I don't think there are any 'long term solutions'.  Try to distract her with something else...",2022-02-05 22:45:26,rlduffy,slossf
Dementia,Rare case,"My grandma developed dementia about 7 months ago. Her mental state degraded rapidly over a short time. With the help of a nurse and a special diet and therapy her condition seemed to halt. A month ago she got positive of COVID and had severe problems with the lungs and heart. She had to breath with an oxygen apparatus. The doctors told me to be prepared as in 90% of the cases, patients with her health issues rarely survived more than a week and it seemed impossible to save her by medicating her at home. She would have had a slight chance to survive if she was addmited to the COVID special hospital. I strongly rejected and continued to give her the medication at home and monitor her breathing day and night under the surveillance of two private doctors. The therapy did wonders and after a week she got better. Last week she started to remember my name and guessed correctly the month and was fully aware of where she was. She even remembered her closest family members who don't live with us. Today she recalled perfectly the former presidents in our country and I was in tears. One interesting aspect is that she can remember what she had for lunch a day ago(something I can't remember for myself), or what we spoke about during this week. She has trouble remembering her time we went to the emergency when she got COVID, but somehow she still has a few memories. Even her behavior is very calm and very appreciative and totally different from the earlier stage. Of course she has her moments of talking nonsense, confusing the reality with dreams or having visions, but she is in a better mental condition than 6 or 5 months ago. The doctors told me that this is very rare to happen and suspect that her brain got a boost from immune system after getting COVID. Her doctor told me that it is impossible to regain full memory, but not unheard of when patients recover slightly during later stages. I'm still amazed.","Maybe she had an undiagnosed ongoing UTI, and the meds that she was on for Covid helped clear that up as well?
What was the special diet and therapy she was put on?
..maybe she was given oxygen? or the breathing apparatus got more oxygen into her lungs and therefore her brain? dunno, just wondering.

So glad she recovered from covid and so glad you are both enjoying this improvement.
It is wonderful when they have good days.
That's very interesting.. especially carbo and sugar loading to get her around the corner thanks I'll go research :)",2022-02-05 20:17:04,Bejliii,slm85e

Dementia,I'm about to start taking care of my Nana.,"She has pretty rapid dementia. My parents asked me to move home to help with her because Im the most helpful and it's work that I'm good at but I've never seen dementia up close until now. I need some tips on how best to help her along with not letting it effect me. From experience, does anyone have anything they wish they had learned before taking care of their loved one?","She will react to your emotional expression more than to what you say, so smile and speak gently. If you respond to her confusion or distress with irritation, she will reflect anger back to you.
Teepa snow has some very insightful information that helps when Careing for a loved one. What I wish all of us caregivers had is more resources that offer respite care. If you can or have family/friends to give you a break from caregiving then let them help as much as possible. Its hard going at this alone.
Don't try to convince them, be logical or change their mind about anything - it will just upset them. For me the biggest thing so far, having a parent in the early stages, is that you just have to adapt to their reality and see things from their perspective
If you can tune into what makes her laugh, keep her laughing. And treat everything as no big deal. She misplaces something? NBD. Makes a mistake? NBD. Cant remember an important name or detail? ""NBD, I do that all the time.""

I'm still learning about how to best help my mom and everyone is different but humour and lightheadedness has carried us a long way on this journey. Best of luck to you and your Nana.💜
You don't need to correct them.  Does it really matter if Bob cut the tree down in 1972 or 1998?  Or that Sally lives in Cleveland, not Dallas?  When my dad first started forgetting things, I thought it was important to ""keep the story straight"", so maybe it would help him better.  But no, it really isn't important and can be upsetting to them if you are constantly trying to correct them.  Eventually, you just have to go with their reality.  We lived right next door to my dad, but he once asked me which bedroom (in his house) was mine.  And little white lies are just fine if you need to keep things going smoothly.
Get as much help as possible. Don’t let your family assume you have taken on caregiving by yourself. Schedule times and chores for everyone. See if there is a Department of Aging in your town that has resources. Have meals in wheels delivered, see if you can get part-time caregivers to come in. That will allow you to schedule time to do your own thing. Hire housekeepers. Schedule other relatives to come in a couple hours a week. If she has social security or other income, let her pay for her own care. The time comes when she may need round the clock care. Don’t think you can do all that. It’s nearly impossible. She may have to move to a care facility.
They read emotions, so don’t get upset with her. It won’t make for an easy day (or week) after that. 

Don’t worry about correcting details in stories. Just go with it.

Make sure she feels safe and secure. Don’t joke/tell stories that could upset her that way (like stories about break ins or mafia, dramatic tv shows, etc)

If she starts sundowning, don’t wait too long to talk to her doctor about medications for it. Also, melatonin helps. Her doctor said 15mg (more than usual recommendations) is what’s useful for this particular issue.

Find a tv show she likes, or maybe a music channel or something.
I haven’t been dealing with my own grandmothers progressing dementia for too long, but “so far” my take away is to learn to accept that you’ll likely be learning and getting to know a new version of someone you had grown to know and love in another version. This is what helps me, but honestly, also makes me sad. It’s not easy. Feel the feelings you feel and be patient and gentle not  just with your loved one, but also with yourself as you learn to navigate the brutality of this condition.
My dad liked watching westerns, law and order, family feud and judge Judy🤷🏽‍♀️ He watched sports with my brother. We gradually got him on a soft schedule that worked until he went on hospice. When he “sundown” it was rough, but got a mild sedative to use at night

Dementia sucks
Hi OP I have a couple of questions and this has turned into a long one so I’m sorry.

Don’t know if you’ll see this, but I have to ask about the dynamic between your parents nana and yourself?
 
What country are you in? 

I have been a caregiver the past 3 years for my grandparents with dementia and due to COVID I found myself isolated and being the only carer. 

My sister is a social worker and has worked tirelessly to keep them in their home, max out their care package and handle medications therapies. The only reason they could stay in their home, the only reason they have gotten the level of care they have is because she knows the system and the right questions to ask to the right people. I would be lost without her she has done so so much over the years, and before I moved back home she was handling it solo while going to school full time in another country. 

With that being said, I moved in, and left my life as I knew it, to be a stop-gap allowing my sister time to handle her own affairs. I cooked/shopped/cleaned, gave rides to appointments, entertained and made sure they were safe while going back to school part time. 

I CANNOT EMPHASIZE  HOW MUCH WORK SHE DID BEHIND THE SCENES. 

I also cannot overstate how burned out I was within the first year. By the third year I was barely hanging on and finding myself in some seriously dark places, but that’s covid life I guess. 

I only survived this with someone that knew the system intimately, that worked as a care provider and worked tirelessly to provide support. 

Now with all of that out of the way… who do you have? 

Who will be there for you? 

Who is helping you tackle the administrative side of this?

What is the long term plan, will you be there a year? Two years? Three years? 

Who will look into care systems, nurses, doctors, appointments?

I don’t want to stress you out with all of these questions but it is REALLY important to have a plan laid out with your family of long term expectations. 


Do they expect you to do everything because you’re the most helpful? 

Will they offer you real respite? 
Covering you for an afternoon, or just one or two days isn’t respite and don’t let yourself think it should be enough. 

Will you have help with her personal care, especially when she becomes bed bound? 

My heart breaks for you, and everyone having to walk a loved one through this disease. 

YOU CANT DO THIS ALONE AND YOU SHOULDN’T BE EXPECTED TO.


With that all said, if I could go back in time with the knowledge of what I went through and the trauma I would endure, I would do it again a million times over for my grandparents. They are everything to me. 

Dementia is different for every person in some way and there are definitely some strategies to use to help yourself and help your nan. 

Write down some stories she is fond of, ask her to tell you about stories from when she was young/working. If there are stories she repeats these are the ones to focus on. 

These memories can be used to diffuse or redirect a conversation.

For example, my grandfather went into a home after some time of my being here and she doesn’t remember that and she also is deathly afraid of being in a nursing home.  

She would get very stressed about this however the care-home was on the same street she used to work on. 

She would ask where he was, I would tell her he’s in a home, she would stress out, and that’s when I redirect.  

I’d tell her the street name, and instantly say “you used to work just down the street from there at (workplace)..” and that would start a happy reminiscence of her coworkers and the kids she would work with. She was happy, and then 5 minutes later…”where’s your grandfather?”

I don’t like to lie to her but you have to understand this is sometimes the only way to diffuse a situation or keep her calm. Some days grandpa was still at work, or out on a long walk or “oh you know that man he never sits still”

Arts and crafts are great! Finger painting, decoration making, making cards for people. 

Sometimes you need to blow a fuse, you can’t keep yourself sane without losing it once or twice. I’ve had some SERIOUS blowout arguments with her where I’ve said things that made me question who I was as a person, but this happens. It feels shitty but sometimes you will need that cathartic release. 

It will be trial and error until you get a rhythm. 

If you’re still reading (I’m sorry it’s so long) understand that if you are living with her, and caring for her YOU are the decision maker. 

Everyone will have these grand ideas of how you should be doing things. If they want to tell you how/when/why to do things then THEY should move in and take the reigns. 

YOU are the one living it, 

YOU are the one keeping her alive, 

YOU are the one seeing her every day and will know best which strategies do and don’t work, 

YOU are the deciding factor in what does and doesn’t get done and you need to stand your ground on that. People don’t understand what it is like until they live it. 

I wish you the best of luck and PLEASE lean on people and please ask for help. 

This is going to be so very hard but I know your nana is so proud of you, and though she may forget your name she won’t forget the love she feels for you. Even when she doesn’t know you she will still love you even if she can’t explain why. 

Also a journal of fun/wacky things that happen can be great, and it’s a great way to remember them as they slowly slip away

Please stay strong and reach out for any help you need.

Dementia,Trying to cope with dad’s dementia and behavioral changes,"My dad is 70 years old and was diagnosed with mild dementia mid last year. This has been the most draining and heartbreaking situation to go through for my mom and me. My husband and I are dealing with infertility and I will be finally starting IVF treatments next week. I need to find a way to keep my mind and body relaxed in order to have a successful outcome. The timing of all of this is horrible and I’m just bracing myself for constant bad news. 

He retired in July and had a great career which required him to always have his licenses renewed and memorize things. The fact that his mind has always been so active and now it’s not is so hard to accept. He also has so much anxiety and doesn’t want to do anything. This is so unlike him. Growing up and living at home was always so pleasant. We’d always take family road trips or day trips. Today I told my mom he should no longer drive. 

 How can I possibly stay strong with while he goes through this cruel disease?!","Contact / research your area dementia .org / alzheimers .org, they have many on-line & in-office resources, info, etc, for people living with memory-loss issues & their family / friends / carers.  The more information you have, the better equipped to deal with it.  Highly recommend for your mom in particular, it's a very traumatic & difficult diagnosis & state to go through.  Good luck with yr treatments, & best of luck with everything!
It may help you, if you actively help him.  See the tips I posted in this [topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s4ldm7/my_mom_is_only_56_and_has_dementia/)
My Dad was diagnosed with FTD 2 years ago and it has not gotten any easier. I wish I could tell you how to make the situation better for yourself but I cannot even do that for myself. All I can do is wish you luck and you got this : )
Ugh I feel this post so hard. I want to have a kid in the next year or two and it feels impossible given my mom's dementia. I'm like you in that I have one other person - my sister - who's doing the caretaking right now. I don't have much advice that others haven't offered already, but consider therapy.

Dementia,I Said Goodbye Today...,"I've lived with my grandma my whole life (33 years). She always gave me food, shelter, and even helped pay for college. We are a poor family; in the spring, I will be the first in my family to get a bachelors thanks to her. We've lived in this trailer since I was 1 year old. These days she acts like she's in another world, she cries frequently, she can't form sentences, she obsessively picks at the carpet, she's forgotten her husband (died 1996) and parents and me, and she requires assistance with everything.

Today when I finished feeding her, I asked if she remembers all the times she said, ""I had the best grandma"". She said ""yes"". I told her that ""I think I have the best grandma"". I told her how much I appreciate everything she's done for me in her lifetime and that I love her, and I already miss her so much. Her response was half of an incoherent sentence before she took a bite using her invisible spoon. I told her I would go get her some ice-cream.

I went to the kitchen and bawled my eyes out and still as I type this. I was a robotic, monotone, and mildly autistic person my whole life so being vulnerable is difficult for me. I don't even know why I'm typing this, I guess I just want to hear what everyone has to say and maybe hear some relevant experiences.","This brought tears to my eyes. 

For what it's worth... I don't know if your grandma understood what you said today, but from the little you've said it sounds like you've always appreciated her, and you're helping take care of her. This might be the first time you put those feelings into words, but it sounds like you have put those feelings into your actions for a long time. And so I would guess that she already knew the things you told her today. 

Hugs.
Even with dementia, there is still a part of them in there. Know she still loves you, and knows how much you love her...even if she cannot express it.

Seeing a loved one decline, especially someone who was such a positive and empowering person in your life, can be extremely painful. Seeing that once strong person seem to wither away into someone completely different...not knowing what the future holds for them...and them lose their independence, their personality, their intelligence, etc...can be one of the hardest things you do.

It is ok to cry. They may not be gone from this world yet, but you are mourning the loss of the person they used to be. It is ok to let it out. It is ok to get a therapist and talk to them if you need to. And sadly, they will still decline and this will get worse before they pass.

Cherish the time you have left with them. Also take solace in the fact that as much as she has done for you your whole life, was there for you, and made your life better/easier...you are a source of comfort and care in her life that is becoming more confusing to her. You are there to help her, comfort her, help her feel safe and loved...and she is not alone. It may not seem like it, because she does not seem to be very present...but you are a bright spot in her day...and you are making more of an impact than you think.

Keep up your awesome care and love...but know its ok to cry and mourn...to do self-care as needed...even if it means talking to someone. You are very much in the grieving process.
I'm sending you a giant hug right now.
Hugs to you 🤗 I believe she understood what you said somewhere deep inside. Find comfort in that. Congratulations and good luck!
She must be so incredibly proud of you!

When you say ""these days,"" is this decline relatively sudden? Because it might be due to a urinary tract infection--it's incredibly common for a cognitive decline to come on fairly suddenly when a person gets a UTI (which is also common). It really is worth getting her checked out if there's any chance this is the case.

I'm sorry if this is a tangent and if this is simply typical of what's been going on for a long time. It must be heartbreaking to see her like this, even if you know that it's easier for her (she sounds happy) than it is for you. You've made her very happy and made her feel very loved, it's clear.
I think you have the best grandma, too.
Thank you for your post. I just posted asking for advice. My mom isn’t as far along but I feel your pain. Your words were very helpful to me. Thank you, for sharing, and for being as important a part in your grandmother’s life as she is in yours.
This made me cry. We've all had these moments where we are aware of what we are losing as dementia claims the person we love. 

&#x200B;

Somewhere inside, your grandmother heard you and knows you love her and appreciate her. She knows you care. That matters. Even though your grief is a heavy price, I'm glad you had some a great grandmother in your life, and that you have the chance now to give back to her with love.
I'm losing someone very special to me also. I realized I'm hurting so much because I love them so much. I'm sorry if this sounds very simple. Congratulations on your accomplishments
In my experience you should talk to her and treat her as a child no matter how she reacts. I had lost hope that my grandma would recall my words, but today she remembered out of blue that I had told her that I was going to be by her side for day and night and thanked me. I have never stopped talking to her even when she would behave angrily and played along whenever she has talked nonsense. If she says I should chase away the dog in our room, I pretend there is a dog and play my act. If she asks about where her mother is(which passed away in 1996) I tell her that she has taken some days off and gone for vacation. If she doesn't want to eat, I take a meal and eat it in front of her as you would do with a kid. If she curses, I laugh and curse too even if there are other people around. Hope you get your strength and be proud of the fighter you have as a grandmother.
Dementia is heartbreaking. I just lost my life long best friend from ftd dementia. FTD dementia is an especially cruel and rare dementia that strikes before age 65. Reading how you treat your grandmother is heartwarming. Keep being kind and if it gets too much get help. I found  hospice is a wonderful resource when the end is near, their kindness is amazing. Join a dementia support group. I belong to a great one on Facebook for ftd dementia, but I'm pretty sure there are others for the different types. You will find good info on resources and advice from helpful people who've been where you are. Best wishes, you are a wonderful grandson!!!
My heart goes out to you. I am mentally preparing myself to say similar words to my own grandmother who had a large hand in raising me, having lived across the street from my parents in the same trailer park as I grew up. She is now in endstage dementia and has been having severe hallucinations for over two days. She is likely going to a long-term care facility but I believe my time to share with her my gratitude and love and to have her maybe grasp it is waning quickly. Thank you for sharing…it helps immensely with grief to hear similar stories and connect even with internet strangers…take care of yourself.",2022-02-04 23:47:09,_Unpopular_Person_,skyf0w
Dementia,Bed sores / pressure ulcers infected - anyone had experience with this?,"As the title reads my mother in a nursing home is in late stage vascular dementia.

She’s bedridden incontinent refuses to eat but drinks plenty fluid. but refuses protein drinks cos she’s deemed them ‘medicine’. Refuses all oral meds but is on morphine patches.

She’s got a ulcer on her buttocks and it now has puss and a smell is noticeable so sounds like an infection. Palliative team will attend next

I know without a doubt this isn’t due to bad care the home is incredible I’ve seen how they work and they’re not understaffed have t had covid outbreak they manage it well.
They thought she’d pass at Christmas but she made it through no co morbidities either.

Has anyone had experience with their loved one having an infected bed sore?","Yes, my grandma had frequent bed sores while she was home, so this definitely isn't exclusive to care facilities. When she had them, her doctor put in orders for a PT, OT, and nurse to come visit her once a week to help with mobility and change her dressings. She also had several visits to a wound clinic that I took her to.

It took several months for them to heal since she's quite elderly (94 at the time) and because of her limited mobility. She was also on a couple of rounds of antibiotics which she never completed because she refused to take any medications. They also gave her some ointment.

Follow guidance from palliative care as they will know what's best! Trust her care team at her nursing home as it sounds like they're doing all they can.

Dementia,Things I Wasn’t Prepared For - A One Year Retrospective on Caring For My Mom with Early-Onset Alzheimer's,,"I'm so sorry. I feel every bit of this. Peace and strength to you. ❤️
Thank you for this. My mom is starting the descent and I have been scrambling to organize and streamline her financial and legal life, along with her living environment. This reminded me to be intentional about spending time with the ""real"" her as the sun is setting on the ""real"" her...

Strength to you and bless you and your mom.
Yes, yes and yes to all. I think I would prefer it be a parent I was taking care of instead of my husband of 48 years.  Instead of enjoying the final years of our lives traveling and enjoying life we now live in a very small bubble as I try to keep things consistent for him.  Such an ugly disease which robs the one we love of everything physical, emotional, psychological. So sorry you are going through this experience.  It is heart wrenching, it is cruel and it seems to never end.  Peace to you as you continue on this journey, you are doing all you can to ease her down this road.
I've gone through much of this (with both my parents), ending over a decade ago.  And now, I'm approaching their age (shudder!).

So, I'm doing the best I can, and have studied dementia online carefully (wish I'd done this decades ago of course).  Several of my tips are posted in this [topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s4ldm7/my_mom_is_only_56_and_has_dementia/)

Dementia,"Need some ideas for my aunt, pretty please?","We went to pick her up because she developed some sort of hoarding behavior and couldn't really get into her house anymore. She was apparently sleeping in her car, even in the snow for were not sure how long. 

Now she's visiting us while we try to figure out the best plan for her and she has never been here. 

She's obsessed with finding missing objects. (Delusions or past memories) 

She went walking down our street in the rain yesterday to find a jacket she thinks she thru over the fence at some building that doesn't exist, here anyway. 

We are worried about her safety but also wondering how best to manage her anxiety around this. 

When it's not the jacket its the dogs she left next door or her billfold etc. 

I'm thinking she may have a bit of ocd or hoarding related ocd / obsessive thoughts or fixations. 

Are there tasks we can do or things we can say or medications we can try?","Does she have a diagnosis of some type of dementia? If so, she needs to see her neurologist or at least a neurologist to get evaluated for her current needs. If she doesn’t yet have a diagnosis, you need to get the ball rolling on getting one.

Once she is diagnosed, they can prescribe her things to help. For instance, my husband takes an anti-anxiety medicine which might be something to consider for your aunt. My husband also takes a medicine that can (hopefully) help him retain some cognitive function a little longer. It’s hard to tell if that’s helping or not since I have no idea what he would be like without it.

Dementia,Where on earth do I get guidance.,"I’m in rural Northern California. 

Mom has dementia. Transitioning from stage four to five. 
My sister (who she has cut off and disowned recently because of something that didn’t actually happen - but is 100% real in her mind) and I have talked extensively over the last few years and we made the decision to a) leave her in her home as long as possible, and then b) when she it wasn’t safe for her alone we would put her in care. We were making a plan to rotate staying with her while we arranged that, and help her pay bills with her still being the primary agent. 
Her paranoia and personality shift has now made that impossible. It’s evident I’ll need full conservatorship within the year. Knowing it can take Months . 
now I’m at the stage where I need to take action both financially and medically and i have ZERO knowledge of how that works. I need a social worker or something. RESOURCES. I’ve made calls to a few attorneys for first step consultations, and I contacted “a place for mom” so I can get a list of memory care units to get on waiting lists… but I’ll need to have guardianship before then because she will not go willingly. I don’t want to wait until she’s completely non-compos mentis because I don’t know how well care for her when she’s there and we have to wait months to get in someplace. 
Ghaaas… 
I need a checklist or steps of what to do. 
I need like, a guide or something. 
It’s crazy that this is so complicated and difficult. 
I mean I am willing to do what’s needed… but HOW?","Call your county's Office of Aging (or similar). They will be able to assign a social worker to your case to help you navigate the governmental side of things and help you understand what resources are available. 

Keep the appointment with an attorney. Conservatorship/guardianship can take months and generally requires an appearance in family court, depending on the state. Have her physician(s) provide you with documentation and diagnosis of her disease and her prognosis. You didn't mention powers of attorney? If you don't already have those and her disease has progressed beyond the point of legally being able to sign documents then you'll need the court to grant those as well. 

Hang in there. This is an arduous and cruel process. You definitely need a lawyer and a social worker on your team.
See if there is an area agency on aging near you - they are a big help. Boy, I could have written this myself - my mom did the same thing to my brother and absolutely REFUSED to see any kind of doctor - even her primary care.  Not sure what to do with the finances as I was already an alternate on my mom's bank account, and she really didn't have much money, but once she's in a facility, they will kind of give you medical POA - at least that's what I've experienced.  Also - if she begins acting erratically, call 911 - that way she can at least be evaluated some how.  Chances are she will freak out when an ambulance shows up, so they may end up calling for police and putting her on a 72 hour psych hold.  If she does go willingly to the ER and not a psych hospital and they try and send her home, reject the discharge.  Tell them you are not coming to get her because she has an issue and they need to figure it out.  That should trigger a social worker to contact you.  You can tell them the story and they can act as kind of a liaison.  Doing this will fast-track getting her into a facility.  Also, try and find an attorney that specializes in elder law.  I am so, so sorry this is happening to you - I've been exactly where you are.  I promise, it does get better.
I am dealing with a similar, albeit slightly more dangerous situation involving exploitation. I would give the Alzheimer's Association a call. They have a 24/7 helpline and can help guide you and will send you notes or resources on what to do. Call them at 800-272-3900. They are very helpful, even just to lend a caring ear.
Your area Council on Aging can be of some help.  How much help will vary from area to area.  The one in my area was of very minimal help, but some areas they are quite good. 

For me, I was able to find an attorney that specialized in aging issues.  I'm not sure where one would be in your area, but for me, this was an INVALUABLE resource. They did everything for me, from all the legal papers (Conservatorship, Power of Attorney, etc) to even filling out and filing paperwork for Medicaid.  They also have a nurse on staff that visits my wife on a regular basis to ensure she is getting proper care in the Nursing home.  

I don't know if something like this exists in your area, but if you can find an attorney that specializes in aging issues and not just a ""general practice"" attorney, that can make a big difference.
I'd see if a part or even a small bit of her dementia is reversible with an excellent diet and good gum care.  Some of my earlier tips are posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s4ldm7/my_mom_is_only_56_and_has_dementia/)
You don't need guardianship. You just need medical and general power of attorney. A bit trickier if she has a trust, but still easier than guardianship. 

You can get your Mom to go to the memory care unit, it's just hard. Don't tell her your plans, get the list of everything the place needs, then find an excuse to take her to the doctor. The doctor will need to fill out forms, and your Mom will need a TB test, etc, etc.

On move day, just keep talking to her, taking turns with your sister or other family members, until she agrees to go. This could take hours. Hug her and love her. 

IMHO it won't be any easier with guardianship.",2022-02-04 13:06:17,AlexLavelle,skjzz6
Dementia,Friday funnies?,"*(Dealing with someone with dementia can be dark and isolating.  Sometimes on Fridays we try to look at the lighter side of things.  Sometimes this includes some dark humor, I guess.)*

Mom: ""Stop vacuuming at 3 in the morning!""

Me: I don't vacuum at 3 in the morning.

Mom: ""Then tell your wife to stop vacuuming at 3 in the morning!""

Me: My wife doesn't vacuum at 3 in the morning.

Mom: ""Then LOCK THE DOORS!  Somebody has been coming into the house at 3 in the morning and vacuuming!!""

Me: ...

A few days later, when it rained heavily, our cellar's sump pump went on.  (Old house, leaky cellar, sump pump automatically pumps out the water when needed.)  I'm used to the sound so I didn't think anything of it until finally it clicked, and I was able to convince my mother that this was the sound she heard and no, we really don't have someone breaking in to vacuum at 3 in the morning.

*(To over-analyze this and pretty much kill any humor, this is where my mother goes A -> B -> C but only says C, so it's very difficult to understand why she's saying C.)*","My dad suddenly went ""Oh that's right, ghosts are afraid of pee"" when there was a lull in the conversation yesterday 🤭
My great aunt, who has never been sick her whole life, had to be hospitalized. She is convinced that she is at her dentist’s office, and is furious that she has been waiting to get her annual cleaning for more than 8 days, now!
My FIL has a commode in his room because he is a very stubborn fall risk… 

I am the one who cleans out the commode. The other day he had a big poo and when I opened the lid it kind of startled me so I said, ‘Lord’…

Me: Nothing, that’s just a big poo

FIL: WHO POOPED IN THERE?!?

Me: you did, Pops
The office of my Mother's doctor called, saying that they had her on the other line, and she had been yelling at the receptionist because the doctor's office didn't send someone to pick her up. 🤦‍♂️

For the past several weeks my Mom has been \*convinced\* that she has a doctor's appointment, leaving me numerous messages about how I was late to pick her up. And though I've tried re-directing her, she finally tracked-down the doctor's office number. Apparently she now believes the doctor's office has a taxi service!

I apologized to them, and blocked their number. 

I'll give my Mom credit, she is persistent! 🤣
My mother regularly talks about one of her three sisters. She talks about how wonderful and kind she is, and that she would really like her to come visit (her sister lives in a rural area outside of the city we live in). She was so happy to hear that her sister would be coming to town to visit her and her other siblings. The day finally comes where my mom gets to visit her favorite sister. When they sit down to visit my mom seems to not realize it's her favirite sister but rather spends the entire evening talking to her favorite sister about how wonderful and kind her favorite sister is and then she looks forward to visiting her in the near future.
My mom called me from the memory care she's in about 2 weeks after she was admitted and left me this message on my cell:

Mom:  You need to come and get me.  I hate it here.  I'm waiting in the lobby.

Voice from the background:  Janet, you're not in the lobby.

Mom:  WELL, I WILL BE IN THE LOBBY.

Voice:  Janet, you're not going down to the lobby.

Mom: Tsk.  \*slams phone down\*

At that point, my mom had been calling me every other day telling me how much she hated it there and what a terrible person I was for putting her there (she was admitted after a trip to the ER after a wandering incident - I didn't ""put her there"").  She has eventually settled in and no longer calls, but I had to stop answering the phone, because she'd only call to yell at me.
Mom called up my sister this week, and was shocked that sis answered the phone.  ""I didn't want to talk to you!"" and hung up.  

Sis and I had a good laugh wondering who she thought she was calling.
Mom this morning  (calling me on her phone from the other room): There are people in the kitchen. I can't go in there!

Me: Nobody's in the kitchen

Mom: Oh yes! Somebody is!!

She had gotten a photo of the pastor's family in the mail and put it on the fridge. She thought the family had moved in with us!!
I just remembered one from a little while ago. 

My mom has Lewy Body Dementia, so she has hallucinations, and always thinks that people in photos are really there. 

Mom and I are in the kitchen, and she leans over to me and says ""Don't tell anyone, but I'm having an affair!"" 

Since she doesn't go anywhere without either me or my dad, and she's been married to my dad for over half a century now, I know that this doesn't reflect *my* reality, but I'm super curious where this is going, so I ask her who with. She tells me about this really cute, funny, smart, young man that she sees often, and I'm wondering who the heck she means! So she pulls me into the den and shows me - ""Isn't he soooo cute??"" 

It's a picture of my dad in his 30s. That's who she's having the affair with. 

&#x200B;

That evening I was talking to dad, and I couldn't *not* tell him, so I said, ""I have some good news and some bad news for you. The bad news is, mom's having an affair, but the good news is, she's having it with you!"" 

&#x200B;

On a more serious note, the one thing that has awed me throughout this dementia experience is the incredible love my parents have for each other. There is no doubt in my mind that they are each other's meant-to-be.
My mom was upset because she thought a bug was crawling on her in the car. We we’re out driving at night so we pulled over to check her out and make sure she was okay. We settled back into the car while my dad went into a store. I decided to play some music I had been listening to earlier, one song in particular “living inside myself” by Gino Vannelli. My mom started getting upset again for some reason. It turns out the song made her think parasites we’re trying to crawl into her skin whenever Gino sang “living inside myself!” I finally connected the dots, laughed and changed the song for her.
I'm sorry...but I would not have been able to stop myself from making a semi-smart ass remark of ""Someone is breaking into the house at 3a and vacuuming? Hells yes! Less for me to do during the day!"" Lol.

But I am glad you figured out what it was...and was able to get your mom to understand.

I have a funny one from years ago while working in a nursing home. I was working 3rd shift at the time. We had this resident in a room clear at the farthest room down the hall (nurse's station was the center of the building, and 4 halls come off of this area). This resident would use her room phone to call the nurses station if she felt you did not get to her call light fast enough. But one night, it was pretty quiet...but then the local police knock at our facility's door. They let us know we had a resident call them, tell them we had kidnapped them, and were holding them against their will. The cops figured they person just had dementia, but still had to stop out anyways. We all had a big laugh about it. It was the lady who would call us for being too slow, that had called them.
I was doing my clinical, and I was put on the dementia unit, and it was wild. Anyway, one day, a regular day there, I’m doing my afternoon task of stopping people from wandering into each other’s rooms. So, I’m sitting, and watching, and see one guy going into a room where the guy (understandably) gets really mad at other people for going in there. We’re always scared of them fighting, and it has happened before. 

So, I get up and rush over to redirect the one resident from going into the guys room. At the same time the one guy is leaving his room, and they meet at the doorway, and the guy starts yelling at the one guy wandering into his room, calling him names. So I’m still trying to stop him, but he backs up, hands up, and points at me and says “it’s not my idea, she’s the one that wanted to die”. 

Lol no 🤦🏻‍♀️ so I tell him “he doesn’t want you in his room, we have to go!”, meanwhile the other guy is still yelling.
This happened a while back -my dad only really remembers his younger years and apparently he had been talking about his old girlfriend that he had before he married my mother (who was big news to me). So my mom and I were asking if he was well behaved or naughty with her, he laughed and said ""Naughty naughty"". We thought that was funny.  Another time he called me a goat (which is supposed to be an insult) but it made me laugh despite the situation.
My grandma kept a magazine cutout of Mike Rowe on her fridge, and she’d had this whole story about how they were married and all. She told EVERYONE about it 🤣 she felt so proud of herself for being such a cougar! But then he apparently started fooling around with the other picture she had on her fridge, of some news anchor lady, and she said “All he did was stand there and hold his shovel anyways. He’d NEVER talk to me!”
My mom asked me, “Does your sister still watch the Bachelor? I don’t know how she can watch all that trash tv.” My mom was the queen of watching horrible reality shows and she and my sister would talk about their shows weekly.
Mum: I know I've asked you this before but I can't remember what the answer was. 
Me:.....
Me: Well what's the question?
Mum: I can't remember. 

If you didn't laugh you'd cry. Ps it's not Friday where I am please forgive me
For some reason, my mum has always remembered Meatloaf (the singer) I suppose cos that Bat out of Hell was on the radio all the time. I don't know why, she's always thought it was one one of my fav bands (not at all particularly).  Anyways, so when he passed away the other week it was on the news, she says ""what, that meaty-loaf who had the famous songs 15 yrs ago??!!  But he was younger than you!!"".  I told her No mum, those songs were big hits when I was barely a teenager, like 40 yrs ago, and he sure was older than me, being a big rock-star n all then... Hmmm, she says, no, it wasn't that long ago, and I always thought he was younger than you!  Lol, she's in the time-warp.
I came into the room and my grandma joyfully cheered, ""Oh there you are, we were just talking about you right now!"" Yes, she was alone. I quickly said to her, ""Do you ladies want anything to drink? Any alchohol?"" To which my grandma laughed and said ""Nah we're good thanks for dropping by.""
Oooh, I would *love* it if someone broke into my house to vacuum! Think I could get them to dust, do dishes, scoop kitty litter too?🤣

What an incredibly cruel disease.

I wish us all the best with this debilitating illness and the heart wrenching decisions that come with it","I get it - but there is absolutely no way we could have cared for my mom in our home - aside from the fact that we have a small, 2-bed bungalow, both my husband and I work full time & we have a teen daughter that I would never ask to take on some of the care.  Mom was leaving her apartment at 4am in the middle of January to ""wait for the bus to take her home"".  You have to come to the understanding that they will eventually need more care than you could ever provide - professional care.  My mom is in a great place - they take great care of her and the other patients - she hasn't looked this good or happy in years.  And at this point, she thinks she's still living in her apartment building.
I tried for ages to get my dad to agree to let me find my mom a memory care placement after she stopped bathing and my aunt and I were having to forcibly bathe her once a week (while she tried to claw and bite us) for most of last year, but his level of denial about her condition was off the charts. 

Then in the fall, my aunt had a surgery and wasn't able to help me with the bathing. I couldn't do it on my own, and my dad wasn't willing to help, so my mom didn't have a bath for a few weeks, and because she was incontinent by this point, and wouldn't even let me change her clothes, she eventually got a UTI and declined so fast that I had to go against my dad and call 911 to get her to the hospital, where she was treated for sepsis and then eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility for rehab. I had to get Adult Protective Services involved to help keep my dad from bringing her back home once Medicare stopped paying for her care there after the first 20 days. 

She's been a resident there for a couple of months now. She never bounced back from the decline brought on by the infection, and is now completely bedridden and barely eats or speaks. Before the infection, she could at least shuffle around the house and feed herself and look at magazines or TV. I wish she could have already been in a memory care unit where she'd have been safe and looked after so that the UTI could have been caught earlier and addressed before her quality of life took such a huge hit.

I can imagine how hard it feels for you to make that call for your mom, but for what it's worth, I wish I'd been in a position to do it for mine a long time ago.
Heartbreaking . For me there was a lot of guilt, which has worked it's way down a bit over time. So I guess my advice or whatever is even if it does seem to get worse as they progress, it will get better over time after they are gone. Do what you can but know your limits because you will ask yourself "" did I do enough? "" at some point down the line.

First, I’m so sorry, this disease is a nightmare. My Gma is moving into a nursing home today, after five years of living with my folks. She and I were incredibly close(and neighbors) for 13 years. They ran it by me on my birthday in December(thankfully was off of work so could just be in my feelings). In my broken heart I know we are doing what is best for her ongoing care, but this is a rough day.
I'm sorry you're at this place. I wouldn't wish this disease, or caring for someone who has it, on anyone.  My mother was diagnosed over 5 years ago, and it's probably been going on a bit longer than that. She went from being wonderful and loving to...just awful. Yelling and threatening and taking off. Physically assaulting me. Emotionally abusing my father. Refusing to eat or drink or take her medications. Refusing to see her doctors.  u=aana 

We placed her in a MC unit over the summer. My father did the best he could, but she was really abusive to him and had him on the edge of a heart attack for over a year. I was flying in once a month for a long weekend to cook and see how things were going, but when I got here last May it was clear that Dad couldn't do it anymore. I set up some home heath care and that didn't work out at all - she kept throwing them out of the house then screaming at us for bringing people in. Dad finally made the decision to find a place for her. It was SO hard on him (and me).   

The interesting thing is that now  she's much MUCH  more stable. Being in a controlled environment where she HAS to take her meds, HAS to eat, and HAS to sleep (nothing coercive) has her feeling calmer and happier. She still wants to come home, but she's able to go through each day without the paranoia and anger that she lived with daily at the house. Her being there has given us time to interact with her in a way that we could not at home. She's getting great care, and she's not in fight or flight mode at all. So it's a win-win, even with the condition that she's not ever coming home. 

You're doing the right thing for both of you. Hugs.
This is a tough decision. Is an in home aide an option to take some of the burden off of the family?  Living at home with in home aides, assisted living with memory care, and a skilled nursing facility all have their pluses and minuses.
Do your research and talk to employees at different homes. Not the people you will expect to talk to, talk to the more entry-level employees. They are more likely to be honest about the facility and the level of care the residents receive. Source: I’m an aide and former dietary server and I have worked in homes that have been extremely neglectful and abusive and would always let someone asking know about that first and foremost. But of course not everyone thinks or acts this way. If you’re in north east Ohio I can help you with some suggestions :)",2022-02-04 04:57:37,Torvabrocoli,sk9n37

So far considering a laniard badge and an airtag tracker.","Sounds like you're doing an awesome job. I'm doing about the same thing with my loved one. He has a bracelet with his info on it and several tile trackers one on his keychain and another in his wallet. I've installed stick on door alarms in case he might wander at night. The best I can do at the moment.
We used a tile tracker on the shoes my dad wore.  Eventually though we had to reverse the locks. Kept the key close by the door but not in sight.  Only took one time wandering off for us to switch the locks. It was very scary.  We also circulated fliers of my dad around the neighborhood with our phone numbers on them to call.  Got the word out so others would be aware if he wandered off again.
My mom has AirTags on her keys, wallet, and purse, and I have her phone sharing location to me. I assume that she will have one of those four things on her at any given time.
My mother has a RoadID bracelet with my phone number on it.  She knows to wear it if she's going somewhere, and she actually does.  And there is an AirTag in the car (I told her about it and explained what it was).
Check with your local police department. Mine has a program to return people who are impaired home when they get lost. I learned about it when my FIL got lost and an officer brought him home.
Does he put his shoes on all the time?  Slide a tile under the shoe liner so he doesnt know it's there
A friend had a ""if found, please contact"" medic alert type bracelet on her dad. It worked when he did wander, and fell and was unable to communicate. 

A more pricey option is a fall alert/tag subscription. The one I'm considering for my dad is somewhere between $60-80/month. The more expensive model is for wanderers - contains GPS trackers.",2022-02-03 18:10:13,WallabyUpstairs1496,sjxdns
Dementia,Mom just got taken to the hospital...,"I got a call from my moms PT nurse about her blood pressure.  They gave her her Lozartan and I came home from work to monitor it. But as soon as I walked in mom was very aggressive. She has been getting increasingly aggressive over the last few weeks/months. 

Today she was wailing and thrashing my apartment. I walked outside to assure my neighbors that she was not being hurt. As I re entered she was in my bathroom with a bottle of Dayquil in her hand and a bottle of bleach in the sink. I suspect she tried to drink the bleach, but could not open the bottle. Then she started chugging the Dayquil. 
I got it away from her and moved her to bedroom as she hit and scratched me. 
So now she is on a 5150 hold.  But since she has Alzheimers...what can they do? 
I also contacted her neurologist re: medication levels but have not heard back yet.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm doing this alone.  
In the mean time anything hazardous is being taken away. Plastic utensils and cleaning supplies will be stored in the garage until I can get decent locks for the cabinets. 
Any other tips?","We had a similar situation with my mother. She was held in a geriatric psych unit (it was very nice and really geared towards aging patients) and they adjusted her meds so she could be functional again. We did eventually place her in a great memory care facility that is 10 minutes away, but the stay at the hospital brought our situation down a few notches so we could breathe and figure out the next step. We could have had the hospital place her somewhere a bit more stringent than the MC facility - and we definitely kept that option open. 

If your mother isn't stable when they want to discharge her, look into the option of NOT accepting that discharge. Ask if they can find a place for her but don't let them release her to you - you'll never get help from them once you have your mom out of their building. When our LOs aren't safe at home -  no matter what we try - it's important to call in the cavalry aka professional help. So sorry you're dealing with this.
my mom had a manic phase and we took her to the hospital and they gave her an IV of some kind of anti anxiety drug and it really calmed her down for weeks.",2022-02-03 17:34:23,esillyamused,sjwikb
Dementia,How do you know it’s dementia?,"So my mother (54) has been shall we say not herself. First notable event was getting into a fistfight with my brother at my other brothers wedding 2 years ago, since then stories of abusing her partner, deep dives into conspiracy theories and lately trying to force my siblings and I to sign up to an anti covid vax group. She also seems to have forgotten I have a 4 month old son she’s seen once. All of this is 100% not who she used to be at all.
Talking to a friend she seems to think it may be early onset dementia. Now neither of us are professionals so I’m left with how do I go about bringing this up with her to get her to go to her gp about it? If done a kinda quick google and she does tick a few of the boxes so to speak, but as we all know Google isn’t an md","The first couple things you mentioned *could* be menopause. If she forgot that you had adopted a cat, that'd be iffy. But the fact that she forgot that you had an *entire pregnancy, childbirth, and baby human (!!!)* is a massive flashing alarm.

You/siblings need to get POA (if in the US). You can tell her, it is for emergencies like if she got hit by a truck and fell into a coma, you need the power of attorney to handle paperwork and make medical decisions on her behalf when she cannot. She may become paranoid if you tell her she has memory problems and then immediately swoop in to take over her affairs.

Sadly, there is a lot of paperwork on the road ahead.
I started trying to get my wife diagnosed for dementia at 55. The neurologist said even though dementia is becoming more common at younger ages, at 55 it is still very rare. Over the next three years, I couldn’t tell you the number of things they tested for that can cause dementia like symptoms.

She was eventually diagnosed, but the point of my comment is - there are a large number of medical factors that could be causing her dementia like symptoms.
I second the POA. My mom had a Springing POA and it was kind of a nightmare to get 2 doctors to sign off. However, it did finally occur during a major crisis due to severe sundowners. Dementia could be the issue. She could have some other neurological issue going on.
I took the ""forgetting"" the 4 month old son to be hyperbole. If she is really truly forgetting that he exists, that is definitely cause for concern about dementia. I thought that OP meant she was not present for him as a grandmother should be. It sounds like perhaps she could be in the MAGA/Anti-Covid/etc. cult. This actually isn't hyperbole. Many of these people are actually brainwashed and have resultant personality changes, fall outs with family, etc.
You'll only know definitively if she gets some tests done, if she's unlikely to take it well if memory problems are mentioned then you or her friend could mention getting bloods taken or a health check and ask for her to come too and get hers done. This will require contacting the GP in advance and making them aware of your concerns.  As others have mentioned do not wait until you have the results to progress PoA, get it sorted now.",2022-02-02 18:39:55,Dontwannabherenemore,sj3obh
Dementia,Is it worth visiting a dementia patient who doesn't recognize you?,,"My LO loves visitors.  It is painful when it is someone they should know, but don’t.  We always ask people to play it cool if they don’t remember them, no don’t you remember questions, which just end up frustrating everyone. Even a short 10 minute visit makes their day.  And as a caregiver I’ll add please ahead of time, plan the visit you will make us happy too, because we thrilled when someone remembers our loved one! Do not just drop in, it can be incredibly stressful.

Please go! Plan a short visit and don’t expect them to engage. Talk about the weather, something that you know would be of interest to them such as a recent sporting event, share a cat video, something funny you read. Ask family what their current interests are (those interests may be simple as watching a game show or helping with laundry) and can give you some ideas of what to chat about if you don’t know past interests. Also things like card games or something similar, is a nice way to pass time if they are still capable.  If they don’t have dietary restrictions bring a treat, everyone can bond over food!
My mother loved visitors until the very end. She didn’t like to be asked questions. She enjoyed hearing stories about the past or what the visitor was doing. She liked to play games appropriately leveled for her abilities. She loved looking at photos. She liked to have her nails done or try a new hand lotion. She loved to watch zinnia tv (zinniatv.com) Even if she didn’t remember, it made her happy in the moment to know she had done things and was happy. When memory is so fleeting, moments count. That’s all a dementia patient has left. Also later stage dementia patients interact like very young children. If you watch toddlers, they play side by side, but not really together. Yet they are socializing. You don’t need to do a lot of interacting with a late stage dementia patient. They can only take in so much stimulation anyway. They do need and enjoy feeling loved and having contact.
My dementia patient, I think, really dislikes being told/feeling that she \*should\* remember someone. She's often happy to interact with new people as perfect but friendly strangers. Except for those of us who see her every day. She recognizes us as ""someone familiar"" but believes us/our proximity to be the source of her pain and discomfort, rather than the result.
Yes. Even if they don't recognize you, they can recognize someone being nice to them.
I will be traveling very soon to visit my mother. And during these past months while in lockdown, I have had a lot of thoughts of why should visit and why not. Inspite of long distance, I manage to speak with her twice a week, so this is doable for longer periods. But the no-brainer reason is that, although we have been at odds for a long time, she is my mother, the one person  who have helped me in my darkest times. And I wouldn't let her die alone.
Yes it's worth it.  And you LO will benefit from any attention.  One of the big reasons my father is treated well is because we go see him often, he gets visits almost every day.  They notice. And if there's there's problem or issue we're on top of it.  So they don't want my father having any.

Go, get to know the staff, talk to other visitors and residents, say hello.  It will do you good too.  You know your LO so you also know their likes and dislikes so they will like you whether they know you or not.  You don't know how lonely it is, and dementia is a lonely disease in itself.
I think it’s something you can only answer yourself. If it causes you or the relative:friend distress from the visit then there’s no harm in not visiting. (I’ve seen people call out for a good while after a visitor has left, worried about them and unable to redirect them because their mind was in a loop. It happens and they do calm down naturally but distress is distress) If you are in this position a good way to support the dementia affected person from a distance is just to ensure they have everything they need. Suitable clothing that changes to their mobility and size (you wouldn’t believe how many families refuse to get new clothing making it difficult on the dementia person to dress causing them more unneeded stress) bringing in favourite snacks that fall within their dietary requirements (example puréed, minced moist diet some nice yoghurts or custards) if they have a favourite drink that requires thickening most residential places will do it for you. And just some nice smelly things.
1. Most enjoy visitors
2. It lets the facility know someone is looking out for them
IMO, if they seem to enjoy the visit, it's worth it. I visited my grandmother, brought her a small milkshake (her favorite thing!) and would calmly/cheerfully tell her silly stories about my dog or my garden without expecting anything in return. She seemed to enjoy the companionship, and the ice cream, even when she didn't know who I was.
I know I sometimes struggle with wanting to visit my mom, the last 8 years have been hard for both of us in different ways. 
She no longer remembers me, can’t really communicate well, and doesn’t seem to understand looking at pictures but she does seem to like having me there. I always bring her a chocolate chip cookie and she enjoys it. I don’t linger but I stay long enough for her to finish her snack and tell her I love her. At this point it’s mostly for me.
We visited my Uncle John for years. He didn’t recognize my mother or I for many of them. Near the end, on one of our visits… my mother stepped out to use the restroom. And he turned to me, and clear as day, asked if “Baba”
was coming back. (That was his childhood nickname for her.) And my mom was in the doorway, and caught him saying it. And it warmed our hearts…and to this day, now long past his death, we are overjoyed that he knew. In that moment, he knew. And it made it all worthwhile.    
Go. Sit. Be. 💙
I regret not speaking to my grandmother (because I was scared, because I was stupid) when she suffered severe dementia. 

I was told it didn’t matter, it matters to me now.
think of the visit being for you, not so much for them

after they're gone, how will you feel about yourself if you skimped on visiting?
My grandmother started to not recognize and call me the wrong names, but I powered through it and stayed until the very end. Honestly it’s up to you if you can handle it and they aren’t being aggressive with you then go. But if they are and it makes you upset then maybe don’t go.
Absolutely. Why do you even care if you don't get recognize? Anyone would feel loved being visited by a real person other than the hallucinations.
Yes
I do believe so yes. I've been taking care of my mum who has alzheimers for the last 6 years now and due to recent circumstances had to place her in permanent care.
If there is no distress during the visit go for it. Sometimes they can surprise you by coming out with things you didn't know or maybe remembering something or you, just for a brief second.
Your attention can mean a lot to the patient and the caregiver(s). Note how they are they doing -- stressed, calm, weary, distracted? -- and think what support you could offer. I used to read to my mother, which she loved even tho she wasn't going to remember the story. We also did a lot of hand holding which seemed to bring peace not only to her but also the staff in the memory wing. Bottom line: Even if your loved one doesn't know who you are, your consideration and companionship can make your visit a blessing.
At least once.
Everybody likes a pleasant visit even if it's from a stranger. Yes?
For me it's was just a matter of being there regardless for them, as they had done for me in the past. The visits can help you sort out how you feel about someone with dementia (it's tough, as people here have shown), but a visit even if un-recognized, is a tremendous act of kindness towards them. 

If there's a negative reaction to your visit, or it causes them distress, then it would be good to reconsider that. Ultimately, do what you feel is right for them as well as yourself. 

hth.
For me yes. My father has EOA, and no longer remembers me must of the time but he is still my father and I want as much time I can before he’s gone. I know he’s not the same man he once was but I love him and would feel like I was abandoning him if I never visited him. I try to see him monthly, I wish it was more but I live 13 hours away. At the end of the day if I didn’t visit I know I would feel guilty, but I know not everyone is the same.
My aunt is 94 and has dementia. Sometimes she doesn’t know who I am, but her personality is still there, she’s still there. We still talk, although she may ask me who I am a million times. If she doesn’t know me, I turn the conversation to when she was young. I’ve actually learned a lot more family history from her this way.  She also loves visitors and doesn’t care if she remembers them or not, she’ll still ask them to visit her again. 

With my aunt, it’s better to visit early in the day because the more tired she is, the worse her memory gets.

Dementia,"Father has dementia, caregiver expecting first baby","I'm 32(f) and since we got an early diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, the plan has always been for my father (62m) to move in with me and my partner when he was no longer able to comfortably drive. He had been travelling in a caravan, trying to enjoy his retirement as best as one can when faced with impending loss of everything that you are.


My mother left him when we got the diagnosis, so she's not an option. My younger brother doesn't own a house to provide for dad. I'm the only option.


I am currently 6 months pregnant with our first child after close to a decade of infertility. Child is both very welcome, very unplanned and terrifyingly inopportune timing. How realistic am I being about the possibility of caring for a newborn, and for my dad at the same time? I also work full time but for the most part dad manages ok by himself during the day.


So far he doesn't have many aggressive episodes so I manage ok, but I don't know how the change in the household (both routine and noise) will or won't trigger him. Would love to hear from folks who have lived through what we are facing.


I don't want to place him in assisted living any sooner than is necessary for him, but I also have no way to know how badly this might go. 

Thanks in advance x","You will burn yourself out pretty quickly trying to take care of a newborn and your father, is there any type of carer that can come into the house or anyone that can take him out during the day?
After trying to get a diagnosis for three years, my wife (now 59) was diagnosed with Lewy-bodies end of 2019. Using a radiated glucose CT/PET scan. This last spring with no further tests, just base upon her symptoms, her neurologist says that Lewy-bodies is a misdiagnosis and she has FTD instead.

At the start of the covid lockdown I was dropping her off in the gym’s parking lot and she could navigate the front desk, showers, etc., swim for a couple of hours and meet me after back in the parking lot after. Now she is wearing a diaper, doesn’t recognize or understand the function of rooms in a house she has lived in for over 20 years. When she needs to use the toilet, she just pulls down her diaper and goes on the floor. She now only goes from the bedroom to the bathroom to the kitchen/living room. On good days when the meds have kicked in we have elaborate routines that take an incredible amount of time for each body function. She despises taking her medications and will bite my fingers, throw the water cup and will not stop arguing about why she doesn’t have to take the medications anymore. She babbles constantly. Bad days - the anger, belligerence and increasingly, hysterical fear, are out of control. Now she is screaming hysterically and fighting for her life every step of the way. Sometimes no amount of coaxing will get her to sit down on the toilet and I will have to force her while she is pinching and biting me. There have been times when if I wasn’t physically stronger than her I would have had to call the cops. She has fled the house before, to be rescued by the police and good samaritans. We have had to drag her back in from outside while she was graphically screaming to the neighbors about the disgusting and disturbing things we were doing. 

I like to think I am physically and mentally one of the toughest persons out there. The last year and half have been incredibly tough and I am worried if I can handle the next year plus I am guessing she has to live.
Having a newborn is absolutely and completely exhausting. So is caring for an elder with dementia. I don't think the two should ever overlap. As others have mentioned here, the disease is unpredictable and dramatic shifts in ability and behavior can occur overnight. Not only will you be physically and mentally unable to care for them both, especially if he declines - the situation may become unsafe. 

And I just want to reiterate the swiftness with which your father might go from ""managing ok by himself during the day"" to forgetting something burning on the stove, hiding soiled undergarments in strange places, screaming or becoming physically violent, thinking your baby is a doll, etc. After my family member got a UTI things were never the same even after treatment. I'm not there yet but I've seen others advise to put your family member in assisted living 6 months before you really feel you have no choice. Lacking in psychic abilities, that means doing it when signs are pointing that way or you have no other options. Best of luck to you and hey congratulations on your pregnancy!
Look for an adult day care program and home health care. Caregiver burnout is very real. Wish you luck moving forward.
My dad passed away from dementia a week after my daughter was born. So while I didn’t take care of both of them at the same time, the thought of doing so seems impossible. I would recommend against it. Best of luck in whatever you decide.
I have a 5 month old baby and a mother in memory care. I've never taken care of them at the same time, but it seems like it would be terribly difficult. You should probably consult with an eldercare lawyer ASAP before the baby comes to figure out how he will be able to pay for additional care, either in-home or in a facility.
I care for my grandma but she has vascular dementia. My son is older but has lived with her for years. I have witnessed things she has done with other children though. She tries to pick them up when she really isn't physically stable enough to. She does not understand when they don't want her attention. She does not like loud noises that children make.She will open the door and not understand who/what (like pets) aren't supposed to be let out. I am lucky that she does not know how to cook or use the microwave so fire hazards are pretty low. 

I would be concerned for the safety of the baby if he has a dramatic shift. Because a lot of time they think they can do more and make good decisions that just are not there anymore. 
My son is almost a teen and it has been exhausting taking care of them both. And I at least was able to have a few years break between cleaning up poop for him vs now for her. 

If you choose to bring him in, realize it may only be for a few years. Realize you may need a nurse or other caregivers to come help. And be mentally prepared that things can change quickly and you may need to get him into a facility. Also you may look into medication if he does have outburst. My grandma was having 1 every few weeks. A low dose of Citalopram has helped stabilize her and her outburst are far fewer. 
I would also make sure you have all your paperwork in order, medical power of attorney or equivalent and anything else you need. While he's more cognizant of what is happening, it is easier and less stressful. And try to have the talk with him. If he's still pretty stable he may be able to state his wishes and understand your concerns. But there comes a point when you make the decisions that are best for everyone involved.
My dad has two or three different sitters come and watch my mom Tues, Wed, and Thursday from 1-6:00 pm each week. There is no adult day care in my city at least according to my mom’s nurse and physical therapist. It gives my dad a break. The sitters are these ladies that they found through a friend, another person who had a loved one who had dementia. He just pays them an hourly wage, like $15 an hour or something (in the US). It’s an easy job. They just hang out with my mom and watch the birds outside together or walk around the yard or watch tv. btw, she uses a gamma 40 hertz meditation light for an hour a day and I swear it helps her symptoms.
Edit: Terrible typing errors.

My father died in June of 2020 and I had to start taking care of my mother 75, who has Vascular Dementia for about 5 years.  In October of the same year my daughter was born.   I was stubborn and wanted to take care of my mother thinking that I could handle it.

I was sadly mistaken.  The stress that it put on me, my mother and the relationship with my wife was extreme.  The relationship with my mother also deteriorated.

I was finally able to get her into a long term care facility last month, and I  slowly starting to work on my relationship with her.

I don't your know situation but I would suggest that you try anything you can to get your father into some sort of assisted living sooner rather than later.
Taking care of someone with later stage dementia is the job of 3-5 people. A baby is the job of at least 2. Unless you are 5-7 people, you're in an impossible situation when the dementia progresses. Get on waitlists for facilities now and try to enjoy his company while you can. Best wishes
I’m not sure I understand why your brother not owning a house means he wouldn’t be able to take your dad in.
[deleted]
Congratulations on your impending arrival! I have two kids and a parent with dementia. I agree with other comments that I would recommend finding more help for him separately, because it will really be exhausting, and honestly difficult to do a good job caring for both a person with dementia and a new baby. For you, your dad, and the baby, the best situation will be one where the caregiver has the necessary emotional and physical reserves and respite. Best of luck.",2022-02-02 05:50:24,ParentalAnalysis,silr1m
Dementia,"Suspect vascular dementia in mom, need diagnosis input","Hi all. 

I suspect mom has the beginnings of vascular dementia. Her mother had it, and apparently mom has been running around with unchecked high cholesterol for fifteen years… and she is really starting to do weirder and weirder stuff. Extremely emotional, impulsive, muddied and crazed thinking… bordering on paranoia. Then days where she seems her normal sharp self.

I have been keeping notes for the dr, who wants to run cognitive tests. 

My question is this - I talked to the dr with mom in the room and told the dr about emotional changes, mom immediately got dismissive and defensive. I want to reach out to the dr, tell her that I am keeping notes and that perhaps we should talk separately. I’m just not sure WHEN to reach out. Should I do it now? Wait till the tests? What happens then if mom is NOT diagnosed because it is too early/she is having a “good day”?

This whole thing is freaking me out… input, please! Thank you!","Dementia sucks, my dad passed June 5th
Reach out to her doctor, let them know you have documented concerns and discuss sharing the information with her primary/neurologist

Dementia sucks
Our dad would sundown and get testy and would not sleep. His primary gave him low dose Ativan to help him sleep….so we could too. We took care of him 2 1/2  years 24/7 at home

Dementia sucks
You can write your concerns/observations down, concise and bulleted examples, and email them to the office just prior to her next appointment. Then bring a copy with you to the appointment and present it to the staff again if needed. Just make sure they have it with the instruction for the doctor to read it prior to seeing your Mom in the exam room.  If you're ever in a situation where you can video an outburst or something strange you want the doctor to see, you might do that too. (Or keep this as an option if you ever feel the doctor isn't ""getting it"" etc.)

Depending on the tests she does, it is possible you won't catch an early stage especially if your Mom was high functioning to begin with. There is also ""showtiming"" when a person with cognitive deficits can suddenly sharpen up for a short period of time in front of doctors, friends, etc. A brain scan may be helpful though even that can be a non-definitive if it's early. You might have a ""watch and see"" for a little while. Also, different doctors have different styles and in my experience this can really impact the speed of diagnosis. (My parent had a female geriatric psychiatrist who was not afraid to call it ""dementia"" and a male long-time ""pal"" internist who would absolutely not go there, ignored family concerns, and kept brushing it off.) If it's not formally diagnosed now, it will be eventually because it's progressive and will always reach a point that it can't be hidden anymore. Use the time to get legalities and plans in order.

Also, if your Mom is not elderly or at least 70+, keep in mind that there are lots of other treatable conditions that could be the cause of what's happening. Dementia is largely a diagnosis of exclusion.  For both of your sakes, I hope it's something else.
I think you should talk to her doctor now.  For a good while my mom was able to ""hold it together"" for these appointments - I had a discussion with her doctor voicing my concerns, and he was able to ask more pointed questions to her.  Give the doc as much information  you can, and they can take it from there.
A 'clean' diet would be a good start (to reduce her cholesterol levels), no trans fats, much lower saturated fats, try for eight or more servings of vegetables and fruits per day (small sized portions if she's badly overweight, the first glass of juice for the day counts as two fruit portions).  My mom had vascular dementia, her B12 levels were also very low so I started her on 'under the tongue' B12 (methylcobalamin, better than cyanocobalamin) which clearly seemed to help, a bit.

Mom also used non-dairy creamer in her coffee, which may explain why her dementia was very slow progressing.  I only learned later that milk/cream in coffee doubles the risk of dementia (epidemiological study), and conclude that dairy weakens the good impact of essential micronutrients (even, from something like coffee).  I think green tea (NO dairy) is healthier than coffee.
The sooner the better. If you have the doctor’s email that would be a good place to share a couple of brief examples that you have documented.

Depending on where you line, in the US your mom would have to sign a document from the clinic/hospital saying it is ok for her doctor to share information with you.

Edit: Even if that document is not on file, at least the doctor has your comments, they just can’t address your concerns without your mom’s permission.",2022-02-01 22:47:09,GenXKaren,siem5s
Dementia,Sundowners,"How do others deal with sundowners when you live with a parent with dementia? I work nights, get up around 11am, take care of stuff around the house, then work. I’m used to playing music, having friends over, cooking after work. I can understand rearranging my life during the work week, but my dad needs complete quiet and darkness after 4pm during the winter, and that’s been killing me the last few months. 

The slightest sound can send him into an angry episode, and he has no concept of time, so me making dinner at 7 pm is the most insane thing to him. I can’t imagine their is a way to change this, I guess it’s more of a vent.","One thing that helped because Mom could somewhat reorient herself was getting a dementia clock. It tells not only the time but also the time of day it is as well as the day of the week, etc. So instead of seeing ""5:30"" she'd see ""5:30 in the evening Tuesday"". It helped her know when she should be sleeping and when she should be awake because darkness outside or light didn't seem to be a clue. It helped settle her sleep patterns.
One thing that helped with my Dad's sundowner behaviors...and was a suggestion left on a thread of me venting on here...is to make sure they are awake and mentally stimulated throughout the day, limited naps...so they are more tired and less agitated at night. How much does he sleep during the day? I know this could be hard to monitor with you working nights.

Other things to try is to make sure you eliminate other needs they may have (toileting/change soiled underwear, are they hungry/thirsty, are they bored or over stimulated, are they uncomfortable in their sitting position or clothes, are they too hot/too cold, etc?

Maybe try to make dinner something you could food prep ahead, so it's not so much noise in the evenings? Like, have your main meal mid-day, and have the leftovers at dinner. Maybe noise canceling headphones for him, or wireless head phones for your music/shows.

:)
One thing that helps my mum is putting music on that she loves. I've got a YouTube playlist curated for her and when she's agitated in the afternoon the music keeps her focused and occupied.
This is one of the hardest things- my father has dementia and i only visited for two weeks and he was up on and off all night long, every night. My mother is caring for him at home and its sucking the life out of her - she looks like she aged a good 20 years. The problem is when he gets out of bed and tries to walk off- she literally cant stay awake because she is exhausted and i found it difficult for only two weeks, much less year round. This is the worst disease of all. I understand cancer and other maladies are painful - but this one steals the essence of a person.

Dementia,Advice would be appreciated - my sister and I can't agree on which of our parents is entering cognitive decline,"New to the sub, and I'm hoping this community might have some insights for us! 
I recently have noticed that my mum (64) is saying a lot of things, multiple things in each conversation, that are demonstrably false. She's always had very different views from me, and she's not highly educated so for a long time I wrote this stuff off as normal. But these days it's becoming more common for these conversations to make her irrationally frustrated and angry. Last night she was spitting venom at dad for not making a recipe for dinner because he said they didn't have the ingredients and she made him list them out and started yelling that she had some of the stuff and he could substitute other things and then threw out some wild stuff like 'dont forget, she was making it for 8 people!!'. These conversations never make any sense, she gets so frustrated when people don't just agree with her and do what she says they should. So I asked my sister, who works as an OT with elderly people, what this might mean. 

Now, she doesn't see them as often as I do, she lives interstate, and she believes that it is dad who is in early stages of cognitive decline but she isn't sure about mum. I spend a fair bit of time with dad, we get along, and I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. But I get along better with him than I do with mum, and my sister gets along better with mum than she does with dad. Is this playing a factor in all this? Has anyone else had this happen? Also, is there any way of testing our theories? Or do we just have to sit and wait for it to get worse and then somehow try to convince them to bring it up with their doctor?","Hey! I'm 37 y.o only child and have been taking care of my 71yo mom and 81yo dad for about two years. They both have dimentia and are getting progressively worse every month.  My dad got diagnosed first and my mom a few months later.  They both started out like your mom with the incoherent and aggressive attitudes and daily chores and normal daily activities became harder to accomplish for them.  I ended up taking them to the doctor and they were referred to a neurologist for further testing and it was one of the hardest days to deal with life knowing that the two most important people were born diagnosed with this ugly and very hard disease. It also gave me a head start to start planning their future with home services and all that other shit that comes with it.  It's been the hardest thing I've ever had to do but it's the least I can do for them after all they have done for me and all the shit I put them through in my life in my teenage years.  Go get them checked out by a doctor,neurologist, or psychiatrist. I'm no expert by any means but if you know something is wrong/off with them then your probably right.  Sorry for the rant but I never had any help from family diagnosing this and honestly didn't really know anyone with this disease. Goodluck and if you need to dm feel free too. I just joined this group to help myself with the struggle and prepare for the worse. I'm only two years in but it feels like this will never end.  ❤🙈😵‍💫
My patient is a lot nicer to the family that visits from out of town, compared to the family that she sees every day. They can indeed muster all the energy to keep their cool for a couple of hours or days. Also, the time of day matters. Late afternoons and evenings tend to be worse than mornings.

She may not notice the cognitive decline quite as much because it is so natural for mom (or you with Dad) and her to think along the same wavelength, and be used to filling in each others' sentences. Especially if you have a high-involvement communication style. Maybe try consciously not doing that for a while.",2022-02-01 18:04:08,StealthandCunning,si8g1x
Dementia,Short Hospital Stay Has Caused a Severity In Symptoms?,"Anyone experience something like this?  

My grandmother is 90, mid-stage, but early-ish mid-stage.  

Just over a week ago, on the 23rd, she went into the hospital.  

It was just a little over 24 hours, and she didn't actually need to be there.  

She woke up with a bad nose bleed around 3am, my grandfather couldn't get it to stop, called for an ambulance.  They were able to get her nose to stop bleeding, but she started going on about being dizzy, she can't sit up, she's going to pass out.  

The thing is, she's known to do this.  She's had a few other mental issues her entire life, and this isn't something new.  My grandfather panicked though, and told them to take her to the hospital.  

Bad choice given what hospitals are like now.  

Long story short, she had to lay on a bed in the hallway from 4 am to 5pm, before finally getting a room.  Had a doctor look at her that night, then again in the morning.  

All that happened is her nose was dry (not surprising they run their heat at 76F at night), and she must have been picking at it.  

Noon the next day, she's back home.  

Since then though, it's like her dementia symptoms have doubled in severity.  

She just lays on the couch most of the day.  She gets completely out of it for hours at a time, like she never has before.  The six months or so, there have been issues with her getting angry when sundowning, but not too severe, and it was only in the evening.

Now, she's getting angry and throwing tantrums in the middle of the day.    

She's began going to bed some nights with her clothes on and insisting they are her pajamas and fighting about it with my grandfather.  She's stopped putting on makeup in the morning or fixing her hair.  She no longer wants to leave the house.  She won't go out for lunch or dinner.  



I told my grandfather he needs to make her an appointment with a doctor, but this seems so weird.  

Her dementia has been a slow and steady progression over the past five years, with some plateaus for several months here and there.  

But now, for some reason this 30ish hour hospital stay, which was for nothing serious, has triggered her to the point where her symptoms are more like someone who is entering the late stage. 

At first we thought maybe she was just a bit frazzled from the experience.  I probably wouldn't be in a good mental state if I was stuck in a hospital hallway for 13 hours with nothing to do.  

But she's still like this 7/8 days later, and seems to be getting worse.  



Has anyone experienced something similar to this with a family member?","I would get an appointment with a doctor. Maybe it’s as simple as a UTI. If she spent 13 hours straight lying on a bed in a hallway, maybe she wasn’t going to the bathroom as often as she normally would. It’s worth checking out since a UTI could explain the sudden decline.
It happened like that to my Dad. He was his complete ""normal"" until a 10 day hospital stay in June. From June to October, it wasn't too bad. Mostly just very bad short term memory and the occasional inappropriate remarks.

But then in October, had to take him to the ER for a fall, and while at the ER that night, had not even been there 3 hours...he started acting like severe dementia. Hallucinations, agitation, being grabby at the bedrails and blankets, etc. They found out next day he was septic from something...and his only symptom had been a little nausea a few hours before his fall.

Since they addressed the source of his infection...which required two serious surgeries and a long bout of IV antibiotics (and now almost perpetual oral antibiotics)...he has improved some, but not a lot. He is a lot better during the day, but since he has the sundowners type, he is worse at night. He still has the bad memory during the day...but if he has hallucinations or agitation, it tend to be evening/night.

But how fast the decline was shocked me. :( Scary, too.
There’s an actual name for this:  “hospital-induced delirium”.  My dad experiences this whenever he spends even a few hours at the hospital or ER.  Last time - in October - he ended up having to be put in restraints, he got so aggressive and belligerent.  His palliative care team (which we got after last hospital visit) has said to avoid the hospital unless it is clearly life or death, and even then!  His cognition declined a lot from that stay.
Hospital delirium is one of the reasons my work tries to refrain from sending our advanced residents to the hospital. The immense change of surroundings is such a shock to the system that they often come back worse, and due to the advanced level of illness the hospital can rarely make a significant health improvement. 

I'm sorry you and your family are going through this. She definitely needs some help now.
Yes. My elder was in for 5 days with no visitors allowed and They wouldn't give him all his normal medications. He was having delusions in the hospital. He told me that he got in a car with a nurse and they went for a ride. And I don't mean he got in a wheelchair He thinks he left the hospital and came back. It took months to get back to normal, but truthfully a bit of their mind did not return to their baseline.
Please, GET one or more humdifiers for her home.  AND, a humidity measuring gadget to check the relative humidity.

Wintertime, the humidity inside can drop well below the comfort zone (30-40% relative humidity) to below measureable amounts (less than 20%, and often plummets below 10%).  This can be a very miserable experience for those experiencing it and are not in robust good health.  She is probably DEHYDRATED from the dry air.

Sure, the higher indoor temperature aggravates that a bit.  But, when you're older you'll appreciate warm temperatures, too, I'll bet.

STRESS such as hallway hospital hanging out, can burn out the cognitive reserve of someone who's mildly impaired, pushing them deep into very unclear thinking and behaviour imo.
This might be delirium, which often is a result of things like hospital stays and can commonly be missed in elder patents. It can appear like sever dementia symptoms, or for those who have dementia already, a sudden and significant worsening.

Yes this happened with my grandmother around Christmas this year. Released Christmas Eve to memory care and is just now starting to get back to her “normal”, 40 some days later. It was such a scary, sudden decline that caused a LOT of stress on everyone involved. I read that sudden changes in routine can cause that.
My husband had blood loss in October and had a transfusion and had issues with dizziness, fainting, regulating temp, hinking , focus, concentration.. even a month after he left the hospital. I would still get her checked out but it could be frorm blood loss.
The disruption in her schedule. My mom is really sensitive to this too.
The acute and dramatic increase in confusion is probably a UTI. But yes, for dementia patients, every physical injury and every (overnight, especially) hospital visit is like one more dent in her brain. She will likely improve a bit, but only up to a new baseline which is worse than before.

Dementia,When is it time to set up an appointment for my mom?,"She asks me about what day it is multiple times a week, she tries to microwave food with the door open while yelling it does not work. She calls repairman and when they can not find anything wrong , they leave she called  4  electricians in 2 days. She wants the deck repaired I got her a few phone numbers she called a couple to come look at it, at least one called back she would not talk to them because she did not want the deck repaired that day.  We have a freezer full of chicken she buys pre cooked chicken and thinks they need to be cooked for over a day in the crock pot., they end up being thrown away because nobody eats them after a week.  She tells me does not know the last time she took her pills almost daily and does not know why they were prescribed?

Does she have to get lost or something big before something can be done?

I have colon cancer and needed rides and other stuff for the last 7 months , but I need more peace than I will ever have around her. If I get worse we would both need more help than the other one could provide.","If you are asking when she needs an appointment to check on a possible dementia diagnosis, I’d say you are overdue.
I'd get an appointment asap. Everything you're describing could be dementia related. The thing that really stands out is the medication issue - that's not just annoying, that's unsafe. My mother stopped taking her BP meds without my father knowing (she hid them in the bathroom) and she ended up having a seizure. I was at their house at the time (I've since moved in with Dad and Mom is in MC) and followed the trail of breadcrumbs and figured out she'd not taken those meds in months. 

I hope you find healing for yourself - I'm sure the stress of taking care of your mother is overwhelming. Once you have a diagnosis you can look into getting some home healthcare, meds for mom, and other assistance so things aren't weighing on you so much. 

Take care.
When she's unmanageable. I'd say it's that time.
Years ago, actually. Get her in now. I'm setting myself up for full neuro/cognitive diagnosis this year, so they can have a baseline for later years. I'm only 56 with no apparent symptoms.
It's time. Also, you need to get her to sign a durable POA so you/other family member can manage her legal and medical affairs on her behalf. There is a lot of paperwork on the road ahead, which is won't be able to manage herself. If she is is in dential about the dementia, tell her it is in case she gets hit by a bus and falls into a coma, for example, and needs her family to do her paperwork for her. Which is  rue.

Are you in the US? If she qualifies, she can get her a personal care assistant paid by Medicaid.",2022-02-01 10:25:54,rwhaan,shxk9o
Dementia,New to this...have some questions.,"I am unable to work full time because I am caring for my mother who was recently diagnosed with dementia. Is there some sort of assistance the government provides caregivers that aren't able to have their own income due to situations like this?

Also, what type of power of attorney do I need, and are there any other documents I can get taken care of that will help me properly handle her situation in the future? 

Basically I am just trying to prepare as best I can for whatever is coming. I'm already on her bank accounts as a second signer, and she has a will and her funeral wishes in writing and the costs prepaid etc. I just assume there are things some of you may have wish you'd known before it was too late or a huge hassle. 

Any advice in that regard would be much appreciated. Thanks for answering so many of my questions already, thankful for this sub.","You're already ahead of the game with knowing her wishes and having your name on the bank accounts so you can do what's necessary when she can't. You'll need both medical and regular PoA. Hopefully she's still cognizant enough and on board with it.

Get in touch with your local council on aging to help you figure out what resources are available to you and your mom.

all of this depends on what state you live in and what insurance your mother has. many times, private insurance will require full or partial payments for in home aids to come out of the estate. but where i live, (MA) mass health has a system in place for this, but it may not be an option unless they qualify. Although many people in this sub have some or a lot of info about this, i seriously recommend talking to an elder law attorney because the laws surrounding POA, wills and trusts change constantly and are dependent on a lot of different things. you'd need to meet with an Elder Law attorney for a POA agreement anyway, but asking a lot of questions will also help with making sure the government doesn't bleed your mother and her assets dry. they can be expensive, but in my experience its an amazing investment. 

furthermore, being a second signer on her bank account may conflict with being her POA, i didn't know this until my grandmothers bank told me, its a conflict of interest i guess? but this also might change state by state. set up a meeting with a banker at her bank to see if it would conflict before you become POA because you don't want it to cause any legal/tax problems. 

Also, we had a lot of my grandmothers assets put into a family trust, so the government/insurance can't seize her assets if she ever has to go into a home.

also make sure you are her health care proxy, this is done at her general practitioners office. 

good luck OP

edit: grammer mistakes
Consult with an elder law attorney.  you probably need a durable power of attorney and a medical one.  they can give you paperwork for a “caregiver agreement” too so that you getting paid out of your moms bank account is above board.  If there is no money to pay you from Mom’s bank account then there is also a way for you to get paid through Medicaid I believe, but again the attorney can help you with that.  Also, if you think you are going to need to talk to social security, they don’t accept a typical power of attorney, so you need to do separate paperwork with them…I can’t remember what it is called.  Our attorney also helped us work through liquidation of all of Mom’s assets and get applied for Medicaid.  They can also help you legally preserve some of Mom’s assets for inheritance if she is going to go on Medicaid so that the state can’t claim everything that is left after she passes.  I thought it was too late to preserve any of moms estate bc of the 5 year look back with Medicaid, but there is a way the attorney could set it up with mom giving us the money as a gift and us taking a penalty on the gift that made it all work out legally.  So even if you think it’s too late in your situation, I’d still consult with an attorney or two to make sure they agree.",2022-01-31 22:03:41,Anticrepuscular_Ray,shkbbu
Dementia,Hang in there.,"That's all.

I needed someone to say this to me, and there's no one to say it at the moment, and it occurred to me that just about everybody here knows what I mean and needs to hear it too.

We got this.","Hang in there, but also seek out the help you need!
Hang in there magnabonzo & everybody!!    Yeh me too by chance today was nearing flip-out limits for a half-hour or so, I was ssteaming.   aarrggghhhh....

So I threw her & a picnic esky & magazines in the car, got more snacks along the way & we've come up to a nearby NatPark for the arvo.   Put her in comfy luxury fold-out chair with lunchbox & newspaper & a hot tea, in the shade, that will occupy her for a few hours & hopefully she'll even have a nap - it's nice warm today not blasting horror heatwave, for a change.   Kookaburras trying to steal our lunch, some lazy roos grazing nearby, maybe we'll even spot a koala later on if we're lucky.  And I'm grazing reddit haha lol.. 

Thanks everyone!
Thank you, I needed it.   


I'm exhausted.
Hell yeah you got this and then some! Your doing the best you can and that's more than enough. Also thank you for doing all that you can do. Caregivers need to hear this more often than people think.
Wow. Thanks. I did need to hear that.  And back at ya'!
we kinda gotta - no choice...
Yes! I need to keep saying this to myself. You are right, there is no one here to say it and I want to keep going with a better outlook! Nice one! Thanks!
Thank you, same to all!
You got this! I had this talk with my sister just last week. Deep breathing and relying on your instincts. Caregiving is hard, but you can do this!
Hang on but try to find help
You can do it ☺️",2022-01-31 12:27:49,magnabonzo,sh6qin
Dementia,"Why does no one tell the truth about dementia, and how can we change that?","Just some idle thoughts on a Monday.

Before my dad was diagnosed, the idea I had of dementia was of someone just getting gradually but peacefully more forgetful.  A slide into dottiness, let's say, and a loss of ability to take care of themselves. Awful, of course, but the main burden on the caregiver would be seeing to their needs. 

I had no idea that feeding my dad or making sure he took his meds would be the absolute LEAST of our problems. I had no clue about the bizarre behavior that was in store, of the anger, the paranoia, the accusations, the aggression, the obsessive-compulsive behavior that turned every attempt to provide any kind of care into, potentially, and hours-long battle. I had no idea of how utterly relentless that behavior would be, day and night. I had no idea how my dad would turn into someone I no longer recognized, and not because he forgot me, but because he did things - awful, scary things - I would never have imagined he'd be capable of doing. 

And no one with that knowledge warned us about any of it. All the neurologist warned us about was that he might hallucinate, and if he did, there were meds for that. She didn't point us to resources. I googled for them myself. She handed out pamphlets but the pamphlets didn't say a damn thing about how our loved one was going to lose their minds in a way more reminiscent of severe mental illness than mere dottiness. I did find resources online and started to get an inkling, but that was only through support groups like this.

Do we just not, as a society, want to talk about this at all, to the extent that doctors won't even tell the truth for fear of spooking the patient or family? I think that's the case, but that leaves us all to stumble through this blind, not knowing what to expect and being blindsided by the reality of it. Has anyone had a similar experience? And if this is how it works, how do we change it? Can we change it, or will any attempt at raising dementia awareness fall on deaf ears, because no one WANTS to hear about what it's really like unless they have to know because, hey, they're in it up to their necks?","> the idea I had of dementia was of someone just getting gradually but peacefully more forgetful

I felt the exact same way before experiencing it firsthand. Nobody talks about the reality of the situation.

One issue why your neurologist might not talk about it is that the specifics vary a lot between people.

The main reason society in general doesn't talk about it, if I had to hazard a guess, is that it's downright frightening to think that anyone could end up like dementia-suffering or other brain-injured people do. Watching my mom fall apart is a living nightmare that I try to censor throughout the day. If I tried to explain it to someone who hasn't had that experience, they'd probably think I'd be overdramatizing things (""it can't get *that* bad, right?"").

I am all for raising awareness now that I've lived through it. I'd hope people would be receptive knowing that, for example, they could be blindsided not just by the logistical and emotional tolls, but the legal and financial difficulties. I tell everyone I know to get their legal and medical documents in order *yesterday* because you don't know if it's going to be necessary at age 40, 60, or 100.

Anyway, yeah, I find it frustrating and bizarre that we end up mired in this situation without any preparation or forewarning.
Also like... the state has NO plan for how to actually deal with the surge in dementia patients when baby boomers get old. Actually, the plan is to make the spouses and adult children carry the load and just be ok with years of their lives getting sucked into a black hole. 

People say it is like caring for a little kid, but no it is much harder. A 3-year-old doesn't write checks to scammers. An infant weighs 5-10% of what an adult human weighs.
I ended up putting my mom in a senior care home because she presented a danger to myself. The knife throwing and scissors stabbing creature inside of her can erupt w/ no warning. My hair grayed out in one year, my friends said I aged 10 years last year, thought it was Covid stress. Now I realize it’s “normal”, or at least not unusual. Good luck to you. I just hope I can be sane enough to take a pill when I’m at that age so my kid won’t have to go through that phase.
I think one of these reasons is much broader: it's hard to talk about abuse. You don't want to tell everyone, my loving parent is a hellion now, because you still love who they were, and because people are judgemental and underestimate the struggle. 

That sundowning confusion can take HOURS of permanent care. That being fought hand and nail leaves you with bruises, that 'caring for their hygiene' involves getting more intimate than you had ever hoped to be. That being yelled at hurts your soul. 

And yet, until you've been there, you won't fully grasp it. They will really, truly forget who you are to them. And that will HURT even when you already saw other memories slipping. 

There are groups for loved ones, there is all kinds of support, and the decline is often slow, and solutions only come after problems arise. Getting a pack of adult diapers with the diagnosis would be a slap in the face. And frequent visits from a home nurse may not be needed for years to come. There's a big lull in action before you suddenly find yourself way out of your depth and in need of professional support. And yet, going into it, it's hard to gauge when the right time is for all those resources. 

My professional advice is always to set up help ahead of time. Get them on the waiting list of the good home, know what resources are available. Do your own research, you will need it.
I have an uncle and aunt with advanced dementia. He gets anxious but is generally pretty chilled and happy to be led around, whilst she is the harridan from hell. We definitely need to be having more conversations about the very different experiences of dementia, and the utter exhaustion of it never letting up.
I wasn’t prepared for the shock of having my dad accuse me of killing my own mother then coming on to my aunt … of  telling me to leave him alone, then accuse me of abandoning him … of telling me I was a thief and stealing all his money then forgetting who I was … I know that was the disease talking, but I HAD NO IDEA … when he finally passed away it was a blessing, but the sadness still lingers that many of the final memories of my dad are those horrible situations … it seems to affect each victim differently so I dont feel it was ‘withheld’ from me, but it certainly wasnt explained very well …
I knew more about it ahead of time because my wife works in hospice, but it's still surreal to see him try to take his shoe off and eat dinner out of it.
The reality of dementia is not a pretty story, and we only like pretty stories. If it's hard and ugly, we don't talk about it. If there are no easy solutions, we don't talk about.
I feel the very same way. You are 100% right that this damned disease is not talked about enough or shown properly in movies. Everything you learn about this is because you've specifically gone through it. I knew my loved one would be forgetful and mildly difficult but I wasn't expecting him to confuse his razor with his toothbrush or trying to explain to him that we can't take the shopping cart home with us. I could name so much stuff he and I have been through that normally wouldn't be a problem. No one tells you have much its gonna hurt watching your loved deteriorate in this awful way or how much time,energy and sanity you yourself end up losing. Its a bad situation all around with little help to be found and all you can do is somehow make the best of it when possible.
No one wants to hear it.  And when caregivers talk about it, other people act like the caregiver is just being selfish and whining.  They just don't understand how relentless the OCD can get.
Nothing in life prepares us for dealing with a family member affected by dementia.  It’s bizarre
I can definitely relate. The book The 36-Hour Day was the best resource for reality, along with groups like this. 

I think most people are embarrassed to talk about it. I know I didn't want to scar anyone's memory of my grandmother, and I knew she would hate being talked about if she had the wherewithal to understand. It feels similar to mental illness; I don't talk about when my mom has a BPD flare-up or when my sister's anxiety is out of control, even though those both affect me as well. 

I also felt the same way about the dying process. Nobody wants to talk about what it looks like. Even hospice doesn't tell you what to expect.
Hear *fucking* hear

It’s another cruelty of the disease
I think at least in part it's because in the outside world we want to protect our loved ones from embarrassing or humiliating experiences, even though they're past the point of caring. We cling to a dignity they no longer have and don't talk about the worst parts except with those who have been through it too and understand.
I found nobody cares. Not their problem. My mom has dementia and is living with 3 minors she adopted. As long as the kids are feed and accounted for the school, CPS, and the doctor turn a blind eye to all of my moms “funny” behavior. Everyone just assumes I (you) will take care of it.
Also nobody talks about the extreme cost. If you aren't penniless or a king you will have everything you own squandered and lost by the time you die. My grandmother had 250k to her name, but thanks to her 12k a month home, it's all gone now. POOF
I had worked for a few years in a LTC facility in food service so I had seen a fair bit, but even then it's different when it's family.  I had started to notice my Grandma's decline because I saw some of the residents behaviour in what she was doing.

Your question makes me think of when there was an attempt at making a movie about Ronald Reagan's dementia.  A comedy.  With Will Ferrell. [Seriously. ](https://variety.com/2016/film/news/will-ferrell-ronald-reagan-movie-controversy-1201763542/)
It's so variable, and they have no way to predict how any one person's course will go.  In this, it's like other mental illnesses. There are people who manage bipolar disorder or schizophrenia by getting enough rest and taking their medication, and others whose lives and the lives of their entire family have been utterly destroyed.
And the ANGER.  They are angry about everything, and it is is always our fault the world isn't working the way it is supposed to.
Unfortunately I don't think it's going to be talked about until family members simply cannot contribute to care any longer and scores of dementia patients are turned over to the state. 

It's sad but it's true.
You nailed it...!!!!!! I’m dealing with my mother’s Lewy Body Dementia and you again just nailed it.!
I agree dementia and Alzheimer's needs to be talked about more. I am lucky, in the sense, that I have worked as a nurse aide for a bit over 20 years, and MOST of that was in nursing homes...so I have a lot of experience with dementia.

Sadly, anywhere from 30%-60% of people with dementia will have behavioral issues...included, but not limited to; depression, anxiety, psychosis, agitation, aggression, disinhibition, sleep disturbances, etc.

The problem is, how someone's dementia progresses, and what ""issues"" they have...end up being as unique as snow flakes. It can depend on the type of dementia they have (Alzheimer's, Lewy body, frontotemporal, vascular, and mixed...being the 5 most common types), what parts of the brain their dementia is attacking, age of onset, etc. Even other health conditions, infections, and other medical situations can worsen the dementia and/or quicken the decline. And even things like trauma and PTSD can cause potential behaviors to be worse.

Having worked as a nurse aide as long as I have, I had seen all different ""combos"". I have seen people with NO behaviors, and just forget how to care for themselves or become physically unable to. I had one lady who could do nothing but move her hands some, swallow food you gave her, her mind mostly gone...but she would chatter nonsense all day. I have had residents that could still do a lot of personal care, even up to the end, but their memory was bad. A few of them did have behaviors. I have had some that were oblivious to having accidents in their pants, and would just keep walking/wondering all over, even when you are trying to set them down for a meal...sometimes getting combative when they could not get up to keep walking. I have had residents who would need complete care, but would cry all the time, or yell at us. I had one lady who was hungry all the time, would yell ""OWWW!!"" if you barely touched her, and would ask me to take her with me when I left. I had a lady who could do most of her self care, except for wiping after a BM...but would hallucinate there was someone hiding in her recliner, and get angry with her if you tried to argue otherwise. I have had residents with sundowners who seem almost normal during the day, but would turn into Satan at night.

It really is hard to guess what, of the many symptoms and behaviors, someone will develop. And with not knowing, it can be hard to plan for. And MOST people...if it does not pertain to them, or personally affect them...would not want to sit around for a long lecture and learning about something with so much info, things that may or may not happen, etc. :(
For me, I knew it is a devastating disease. I don't feel like anyone was trying to hide that. I just hoped it wouldn't affect my loved ones. I'm sitting next to my grandma who is in hospice care with dementia. It's not fun, but it's not as bad as it could be.
I work in aged care, specially secure D3 dementia units. 

When I first started in aged care I had limited knowledge of dementia and I didn't think about it alot as I worked in resthome and hospital level but after experiencing caring for and being around people who had dementia but weren't assessed as D3 or D6, I quickly saw how vastly different it presented in people. I also saw how devastated and heart broken it left families.

Now I work in secure D3 unit and have a certification in specialized dementia care. I've seen the good, the bad and the bizarre. My grandfather has early stage dementia (GP stated ""likely mild cognitive decline"" which is common for doctors here as they don't want to be the one to diagnose dementia but that's a whole different story for another day) and I'm now dealing with this in both my personal and professional life.

These are the conclusions I have drawn:

1: fear mongering.

Health professionals don't want to scare families unnecessarily and the GP will often pass the educating responsibility on to someone who is more specialized such as a MHSOP (Mental Health Services for Older People) or Psychogeriatric specialist because they either don't know enough personally or feel they are likely to unintentionally mislead the client.

2: fear of societal judgement/stigma

There is huge amount of pressure on people not to ""give up"" on their loved ones which is how many people consider it to be when a loved one transitions from assisted living (in their own home) to Long Term Care Facility. Many cultures consider it a disgrace to send a loved one into care, many spouses consider it a breech of their wedding vows (til death do us part, in sickness and in health etc) and this often leads to people who live with dementia suffering unnecessarily due to being cared for by people who love them but don't have the training or knowledge to care for them as the need/deserve. 

3: shame/denial

There is an old stigma that dementia is caused by drug and alcohol abuse. Whilst this CAN be a cause of dementia, this is not mutually exclusive. Dementia is a brain injury and can be caused by so many things it'd take half the day to write them all out. This means a lot of people are reluctant to admit or talk about loved ones who have dementia because they don't want to tarnish or corrupt others of their memory.

4: ever evolving

As medicine evolves and people live longer, it is becoming more and more clear that unless something else kills you first, you're highly likely to develop dementia as you age. This is currently thought to be due to medicine curing other previously deadly ailments and some people think the medicine CAUSES dementia but my thoughts (based on personal experience working with those living with dementia as well as having a specialized qualification where this was taught as a possibility) on this are that if you like long enough, you will get dementia. It is the brain dying, evidenced but the white matter present in brain scans of those whoth dementia, and all the assumptions that the medications or lifestyle someone lives is the reason they have dementia are not entirely correct. I believe that certain things can speed the onset of dementia but won't be the sole cause of it.

Because medicine is evolving and dementia is mostly present in the geriatric or elderly, we're looking back and drawing patterns that don't always read as they are, but sometimes more of a coincidence or possibility of connection. 

As for how to change this? Talk about it. Share your experiences, opinions and discuss how dementia is effecting you, your loved ones and keep talking about it. I am very open about my experiences, the good, the bad, and the bizarre. Of course I sensor to not violate privacy or patient confidentiality but I make sure to discuss all aspects so people are aware.
You could not have summed this up any better wow all I can say is YES YES to all you’ve said. Like when someone has their first baby and they experience things no one told them about. You feel little cheated by society in general 

I too thought ‘they get forgetful, turn into little old helpless people that end up frail needing help walking sometimes’ 

Wow so many of us are shocked at what dementia can do to a person in a short time
I think the behaviour depends of which parts of the brain are affected. My father was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, he was mainly aggressive at the beginning of disease. I took him to Germany for another check up. The neurologist said that there are very little research on dementia. It’s more known about Alzheimer’s
I am so relieved that I wasn't the only one who felt this way. My sister and I entertain the idea of locking her in her room. The running around naked, the psychical and emotional abuse. It felt like it would never end. I was a shell of myself and had to find ways to numb myself. I didn't really use drugs or booze but maybe too much internet porn as a escape.
Yeah, this disease is a complete horror show. I never thought that I’d be physically fighting my mother to NOT yank her catheter out or begging her to open her mouth so she could take her medication then compromising my mental and financial health. It is the most tragic disease. 

The lack of information and resources is staggering.
I'm in my late 20s; my parents are in their mid-60s and still going strong. They've slowed down of course but the mental decline is decades off, God willing. (I know we don't all get that lucky.)

Anyway, I read here and /r/AgingParents so I can learn a little bit about what will come. So you're reaching somebody — you're reaching me! Thank you for sharing your experiences.
My take on this is that if you haven't experienced it you can't explain or relate to others. Doctors will basically quote what they learned, but they more than likely never had to deal with a love one for days on end.

Everything boils down to take this or that pill to manage the illness, never to fix it. If the pills don't work lets adjust the dosis or use this other one. 

They don't tell you either that all the pills are good for is just to keep the person quiet or dull, nothing gets fixed or improve you are just building sand castles below the high tide mark.
I’m guessing because nobody cares until they or someone else has it. Kind of like an out of sight out of mind thing. It’s such a horrible thing and people genuinely want to feel good not reminded or made aware of things like this. Especially if it doesn’t concern them. I used to be one of them people and would stay away from anything negative as well as I could but when it smacks you in the face that a parent has it there is no avoiding it. 

In general people should be made to stay a lot more humble so when shit hits the fan they haven’t got so far to fall
ageism run rampant
YES. Everything is so sugarcoated. 

Our society is not set up to deal with dementia - so many gotchas and catch-22’s when it comes to getting people adequate care and a safe place to live.
Yes and Yes. My mom went on hospice mid-September and her dementia has taken off. No support, no warning, no ideas at all for how to care for her (and ourselves, honestly) while our loved one slides into deep negativity, paranoia and pure anxiety. I feel very frustrated and angry about this. You can hand me all the damn pamphlets you want, that's not going to do it. Some sort of training for loved ones/caregivers would be the way to go, and that's nonexistent. Hang in there, I totally get this. Take care of yourself!
I think that’s a hard question to answer because it’s a multifaceted disease that affects everyone differently. I agree that the psychotic aspects are grossly under disclosed by medical professionals. It seems that they only share on a need-to-know basis and on our end at least, it’s like “hey, here’s your diagnosis and it’s a life sentence that’s never going to get better or be predictable.” 

I’m in a similar predicament as you are but it’s coupled with years prior with mental illness. It sucks and is so incredibly painful to experience from observational, relational, and interpersonal stand points. I’d love to hear more about some of your resource findings for meds.",2022-01-31 11:14:56,microbewhisperer,sh4x6r
Dementia,Diapers/solution for fecal incontinence,"Our journey just got a little more complicated - Mom's having problems with soiling herself. This just started and I'm at a loss about the logistics of dealing with it in a way that allows her to keep her dignity as much as possible. She lives in a Memory care facility and it's a nice place, we take her out a couple of times a week for lunch or ""shopping"". I also take her to a local park/garden and we walk. However, with this new twist I'm not sure how to handle it. 

First off - diapers. So far I don't think she's full-out having bowel movements in her pants, although I can't swear to it. She just told my father about this yesterday. We thought it had happened before but it was sporadic. What is a good option for this type of incontinence? 

Also - I haven't changed a diaper in 22 years (my youngest child who is now an adult). Is the procedure pretty much the same sans changing table? If you're out with your LO and this happens, how do you handle it? I don't want to shame her if we have to change her diaper when she's out, or just leave and take her back to the MC to handle it if I can avoid it - that would seem punitive for something that's out of her control. 

If you are able to change the diaper, what the heck do you do with it if you're out? 

Any tips, ideas, assistance would be highly appreciated. Thank goodness for this sub - you all are a godsend to me. 

&#x200B;

TIA.","Determine what it is that she uses in facility. Even if she uses the traditional brief style she will likely be fine with just a pull up type incontinence garment for the duration of an outing (there are a variety of absorbency levels to choose from). Just pack an extra pull up or two with you as well as a decently sized package of wet wipes in a backpack or larger hand bag when you go out. Keep a few plastic bags handy for any soiled items that need to go back with you or get tossed. It's also a good idea to take an extra pair of pants just in case (leggings are light to pack for example). If you feel she has soiled herself during an outing you can assist her to the accessible bathroom stall and help her change out her ""underwear"" while she is seated. If she can help with the wet wipe cleansing then encourage it but if not you may have to help with that aspect. If she is resistant to let you assist her just try to encourage by saying that her nurses instructed you to help her so that you could enjoy your nice outing longer.   I hope this helps.
Ok. First of all, all these things are ""normal"". I use the quotes because let's face it, none of this is really normal. But this issue you are facing unfortunately is common with our loved ones at this point in their lives.

Edit. Sorry I hit post before I was done. The diapers are pull ups. They're not like children's diapers, at least the ones we use aren't, and we're just like regular undies, and they're made so if something does happen while you're out,you can make it home.

Edit2: omg I did it again!!!! As for the changing part, it's just like taking off underwear. I mean, if it's a wreak down there and you need a shower, I suppose there are exceptions to every rule, but for the most part it's just changing your underwear. NOT like changing a baby. Hang in there, it's good you have professional help because it does get difficult at times.
Echoing most of what others have said. I have worked as a nurse aid for a bit over 20 years.

The incontinence briefs come in two different styles. There is the ones that remind you of what kids diapers look like, they fasten on the sides, and tend to hold more/be more absorbent than the other type. The 2nd type look more like underwear. They still hold a good amount, but are slightly less absorbent than the kind that looks like diapers.

If your mom is more mobile, it is easier to help her while she is sitting on the toilet. While she is sitting, you can remove the old/soiled brief, and get the new one in place. For the attends (diaper-looking) you can undo the sides OR pull them down like underwear...which ever will prevent the mess from getting on clothes. The underwear-like ones...again, you can pull them down like underwear OR can rip the sides of them to removed them...again, which ever helps you prevent a mess easier. TO put them back in place, is pretty easy, as well. The underwear-like ones are pretty self-explanatory. Just put them on like you would underwear. For the diaper-like ones, place the front across their upper thighs, ask her to hold it there if she can...tuck the back end under, pull the sides around the legs, and pre-fasten the tabs so you can pull is up like underwear when they stand. It is easier to pre-fasten it looser than needed and adjust...than trying to loosen it while trying to pull up.

As far as cleaning goes, and depending on where you are...my best advice is to use a combo of toilet paper and wipe. Wipes can be expensive over time. Also, to good wipes tend to be more ""moist"" and can just spread around certain types of bowel movement. Use TP to get as much off as you can, then use the wipes to get them cleaned the rest of the way. Remember that even if the wipes package says flushable...do NOT flush them! Any plumber will tell you to not flush them.

If it is hard for them to stand, have them lean forward and clean from behind, but from front to back. If they can stand, it is easier...but still clean from behind, doing a front to back cleaning. Sometimes it helps to have them slightly bend forward over their walker, so you can get skin folds clean, as well.

You can carry a plastic shopping bag to throw the wipes and soiled briefs in. In most places, it would be ok to just toss this into the trash can in their bathrooms. But in the small chance you cannot, you can take it with you to toss in the trash at home.

I would also suggest, just in case...you take a change of clothes with you, as well. As absorbent as briefs are, there are still accidents that get the clothes. Briefs shift, just like underwear do, when we move/sit/fidget/etc. So sometimes, a bit can leak out. Or, if they have a mess, it's possible to get it on the clothes while trying to remove the brief...no matter how careful you are. It happens, even to those who have been doing this a long time. Also carry a bag to put the soiled clothes in until you get them back to the facility (and they can put it in their laundry) or back to your place (as some family prefer to do their loved one's laundry).

I hope this help.
You are right that she should be able to go out and do interesting things and interact with the outside world without embarrassment, and feel ""normal"" for as long as possible.

If she is able to dress herself, they have pull-up types. I've even seen them in ""feminine"" colors like black and blush rather than medical-grade white. If she is able to put on underwear herself, you can fill her underwear drawer with these, then she puts them on in the morning like normal. You may want to simply call them *underwear* or *panties* instead of *diapers*. Some seniors are very resistant to being infantilized, and could reject the idea outright if you call them diapers.

They also have ""booster pads"" that stick to the inside of underwear or the diaper. which are basically similar to menstrual pads. but quite a bit thicker. They are much easier to change out in the bathroom stall during an outing, without needing to undress. She may be able to replace these herself. They should fit in the tampon/pad trash can in the toilet stalls. Bringing baby wipes to clean herself at mid-day changes are a good idea.

Then there are the side-attach type. They are typically heavy absorbency, for overnight. And they are the only type you can use if the patient cannot really stand or walk at all, and must be rolled over in bed.
A company called North shore incontinence supply was a godsend when I was taking care of my late husband. They have a lot of information and many different types of incontinence supplies. They will even send you samples.
As a tip from nursing my Nanna, these incontinence pants can be cut off to minimise the mess. Trust me, it minimises the mess!
A lot of good information here, just one more tip; a water bottle with a sports top makes a useful travel bidet.  You can fill it with warm water at the tap and bring it back into the stall to direct a stream of water where needed.  If it is a major disaster, you can even fill it with soapy water and then rinse.  My mom went through a rough period during her chemo where I'd use a hiking hydration pack.  It worked like a charm.",2022-01-31 07:57:01,cobaltsvaleria,sh0mt4
Dementia,Care homes and the costs associated,I'm wondering if care homes for patients with dementia are covered by medicaid/insurance typically or if it's all out of pocket. I'm trying to determine if when the time comes all my mother's savings will just be sucked up or if she will have some of her stay covered.,"There is only one type of insurance that covers long-term care and that is long-term care insurance.  You have to buy it before you are diagnosed with memory issues or a disability. Medicaid covers long-term care but only if a person has very limited income and assets. To qualify, you can't have more than $2,000 in assets.  Google the rules for your state.  

If your loved one has a pension and social security, they can use those to pay for their care. If your mother owns a home, she can sell it and use that money toward her care. It might allow her to move into a nicer place.  I'm not sure the places covered by Medicaid are the best quality. We just placed a relative in an assisted living apartment last year.  It's expensive, but her rent covers everything --housing, utilities, food, housekeeping, caregivers and social activities.  Her only other expenses are her phone and a small insurance policy. Because she can't drive anymore, we sold her car and put the money in her savings account. If there is a social worker who works with your mother's doctor that person would be an excellent resource.
Also there is some help from the VA if the person served, served during war, or was the spouse of someone who served during war. Not sure how much now though
Adding on to what's already been said (and specifically the comment about Medicaid facilities possibly not being as nice as facilities that don't take Medicaid): Some facilities will take medicaid only if the person has been private pay for a certain period of time (such as a year or more). So, it might pay to research and plan accordingly if you think the patient will run out of their own funds so you can get them in the best facility possible (and not have to move).
I contacted an Elder Care Attorney and highly recommend one if you're unable to afford care (it's ridiculously expensive) and don't have insurance options.   


The attorney I spoke to gave me loads of information on what it takes to qualify for MediCal and how the process works when placing your loved one in a facility.  Most attorneys will give you a consultation and you won't be charged unless you hire them. In my situation, Mom is going on waiting lists for Skilled Nursing Facilities and when she is placed, I hire the attorney to file the MediCal paperwork.

Dementia,Does it always have to progress?,"Can it stay at a certain stage? Does it have to? Idk how exactly it works, but does it always have to end in death?","Sadly, it will always end in death.  Dementia isn't just forgetting things or getting confused.  The person's brain is shutting down.  With my mother it seems that there is a decline and then a leveling off for a little while, and then another rapid decline.  The cycle then repeats.  This can last for years with some people.  

Who knows, maybe it will last long enough for medicine to find some answers.
The science isn't there yet. The only type of dementia that can be halted or even reversed is Normal Pressure Hydrocephaly. which usually gets misdiagnosed as an incurable dementia such as Alzheimer’s because that is more common and a more likely answer. 

you can try to avoid events that accelerate the dementia. start using hearing aids if there is hearing loss. keep good hygiene to avoid UTIs. Don’t take Benadryl. most importantly to stay socially engaged. They can have a normal-feeling daily routine, low-risk errands, and social life while living in a walkable neighborhood for a very long time, several years even, beyond the point when it is not safe to drive. 

Every hospitalization, especially if it results in a broken hip or leg, makes it worse in the long run.  if the house has stairs and is not safe, it is better to move them in early stage while they can still form new muscle memories and social attachments. If you move them in mid stage *after* some injury, they could lose their anchor and become unhinged, and rapidly decline.
There is a difference between SYMPTOMS of dementia and ""dementia"" as a diagnosis (which usually becomes more clarified with time to Alzheimers, Vascular dementia, Lewy Body, or Fronto-Temporal -- although there are close to 100 types of dementia).  

Symptoms of dementia can be caused from many different things. many times the dementia progress can be either reversed or arrested -- if they are caught and treated in a timely manner.

But dementia as a diagnosis is brain failure and will end in death.",2022-01-30 21:35:04,kumori_77,sgpzjt
Dementia,How did you know they couldn't live on their own anymore?,What signs or situations made you realize they weren't able to live alone?,"When leaving his apartment in ther evening felt like leaving a 2-year-old alone in an apartment.
She didn't know how to use the microwave anymore, wasn't bathing because she would always turn the shower on scalding hot so she was afraid of it, couldn't keep her stuff organized and clean, couldn't hang her clothes on hangers properly, couldn't dress properly (everything was always inside out or backwards), and the last grand finale event, turned a gas stove on to try to make tea but couldn't ignite the burner, so she was just letting it leak gas.
Letting strangers (solicitors) in the house, not bathing regularly, not eating properly, bills not being paid, flushing items (other than TP) down the toilet. But wait! There’s more! Wandering the nhood and going into other people’s houses, trying to walk to the store (miles away) because she was no longer allowed to drive.
Gosh, this is hard.  I know my parents need to move to assisted living but my father doesn’t think it’s time yet. 

Dad: 84. COPD & pacemaker. Mentally alert & caregiver to mom. Traditional marriage dynamic meaning he doesn’t cook nor clean.

Mom: 84. Dementia diagnosis at 80. Has taken a few falls. Osteoporosis coupled with weight loss- barely eats. Very confused w/ poor memory. Invents new stories. Angry AF & physically abusive to me (dad?) Can’t perform simple meal prep tasks easily. Doesn’t do her laundry (it’s getting gross) but does my dads. The kicker- She soiled herself 4 days ago & the pants are squirreled away in her room somewhere.

Is it terrible that I *want* a fall that requires minor medical attention so this speeds up the process in my dads hesitation.  I keep telling him that if he doesn’t move with her & something happens to him it’s going to be horrifically traumatic for everyone involved.
Falling and breaking her wrist was the tipping point. But before that missing paying bills, being scammed out of money, stopping bathing and brushing teeth, not caring for the house and yard at all, being uncertain where she was only a few blocks from home, forgetting her own personal history, losing weight, general confusion.
Ours was kind of complicated. But essentially falls was our big factor. Her 2nd husband died and even prior to his death she fell a few times at their house. She was having more memory issues and didn't really cook. He was the more alert and cognitive person. Without him she could not stay in a home alone safely.
While my grandma's husband was still alive, we didn't notice she was having symptoms, because he would take care everything, like cooking, or they would go shopping together, etc. When he died, we immediately saw all the signs while visiting. ""Suddenly"" she wasn't capable of doing anything. It just became visible after being disguised for so long. Her husband didn't really realize anything was wrong either.
When dad knew how to use power tools but forgot safety rules he used religiously in the past. Drilling into wood on his lap and narrowly missing both thigh and power cord as I walked in, for example. This was combined with long absences when he took the dog for a walk because he got distracted and\or lost in the neighborhood he lived in for 50 years. Mom had been directing him for years and we had no idea how bad it really was until she passed away.
No longer allowed to drive 7 months ago, but the final straw was forgetting food cooking on the stove. Thankfully, no fires; but it was only a matter of time. She's living with a daughter now.
Hallucinating and being convinced there were people living on her roof. Neighbors calling me because she was outside in freezing temps screaming at imaginary people. When I flew up to check in, she was cooking dinner for said imaginary people.
Mom had been complaining about dad's memory, but, historically, mom complained about dad a lot anyway, so we took her complaints in the context of their marital history.

A couple of things made it clear. The first was losing the ability to deal with his taxes. That seems pretty high level, but when he read a letter from the IRS to me 3 or 4 times in a row on a single phone call like we hadn't already discussed the details, I knew something was up.

Dad was also always difficult about medications. He didn't like taking anything prescription, but he needed to take blood pressure meds. He obsessed over his BP and when his homeopathic and alternative treatments weren't doing the job, he started popping nitroglycerin tablets to control his BP - that only works briefly and causes more trouble when the effect wears off and the BP rebounds. So, med mismanagement, but with extra steps.

Interestingly, since he and mom have gone to assisted living and he's getting good med management, we think his dementia was a little better. Could be the Aricept too.
She forgot how to use the stove and was only eating things cold from the fridge.  Also, I realized that she wasn’t bathing very often anymore, and she had always loved her long daily baths.
Just off the top of my head, and these have all been in the past year or more, but has gotten worse the past month: She isn’t taking her meds. She doesn’t cook anymore but would gobble up snacks or any food that people brought over. Her house which had been tidy and clean for 60 years, became cluttered and the toilet was dirty. She stopped getting her hair cut and she stopped wearing makeup. She claims to have showered but hasn’t. She wears the same clothes every day and they aren’t appropriate (capris in winter). She gets belligerent when encouraged to do anything, like put on a coat. She can’t work her tablet anymore or most electronic devices. Her ability to operate the coffee pot went from poor to non-existent. She gets the cordless (land line) phone mixed up with the tv remote. Basically she can’t operate things with multiple steps like a washing machine.
My grandma accidentally killed her cat by giving her cat her (my grandma’s) medications. Poor cat covered the basement of my grandmas house in vomit and diarrhea and eventually had to be put down. 

Also she couldn’t understand medications and when or how to take them. She was cutting up her pills for no reason and placing them around the house. Basically only ate pudding and made her diabetes worse. She also has diverticulitis and was unaware it flared up again until her church dragged her to the hospital.",2022-01-30 19:52:02,Anticrepuscular_Ray,sgnv0o
Dementia,Vacation with dementia father,"My father has early onset (under 70) dementia, but my mother has no cognitive difficulties at all. He's probably middle stage and starting to really struggle, but my mom understandably doesn't want to give up parts of her own life. She wants to go on an overseas vacation with him, and with my family (and kids), over the summer, and I'm really worried because of how hard a time he has with new environments. She seems determined to do this and deal with the consequences, but I'm worried this is going to be a form of torture for him.

Has anyone done any sort of major travel with an elderly family member with dementia? Is this a terrible idea and something I need to discourage her from?","YES! My daughter wanted her grandfather, my dad, to spend thanksgiving with her in her new home. Back story, she was in some denial, my parents were her only grandparents, he paid for her wedding reception, gave her away and helped her financially they college and getting her masters. 

My sister bought him new everything, he had a brand new suit and my son n love drove 4 hours to pick the both of them up and 4 hours back, Wednesday. By Friday night they were back and he was quite disoriented didn’t know where he was and didn’t remember the trip. We had pictures of him very engaged with the great grands and shooting pool but he didn’t remember. His baseline dropped after that. 
With dementia it’s better to keep them in familiar surroundings. We took care of our dad in his home for 2 1/2 years til he died this past June. He could walk around in his house in the dark, but we couldn’t take him away for more than a trip to the gas station or car wash

It might not be a good experience to take him away and may do more harm
Agree with the other posters, your father is likely to feel even more confused & insecure in unfamiliar surroundings. He'll also have to presumably cope with airports, flying, and potentially a different culture & cuisine, and an unfamiliar language and currency. 

Additionally, if your father does stray from your family group and can't find his way back to your lodgings, you now have to deal with that country's procedures for finding missing people. 

To be blunt, a holiday should be carefree & enjoyable for all family members; I understand your mom wanting to keep things as normal as possible, but this sounds like a recipe for stress all round.
I was originally going to send my mom on a vacation back to her home country. After a heart to heart with her part-time caretaker, i elected to keep her home. If he easily gets disoriented best to skip the vacation or she should go on her own.
My grandma is older but we took her on her last long distance trip in the summer last year. Flying was difficult. We went to 2 different family homes and she really struggled to understand where she was. When we came home it took a few days for her to know it was her room and house and we were done traveling. It was super stressful for us (which we expected and were prepared for) and she was wiped out for days after. Maybe 2 weeks after the trip she was more on a regular schedule.

And this trip was only domestic flights and traveling with family she lives with and sees daily. 
I would be concerned for the kids too. If he has behavioral outburst due to his frustrations or fears, the kids may not understand what is happening depending on age. Which just raises all sorts of undue stress on everyone.

My father (who does not have dementia) has passed on many family vacations due to all sorts of reasons. It never negatively impacted our trips. I have also vacationed without my husband a lot due to his career fields. 

You may be able to find respite care that he could stay at while the family vacations. He may be able to go even sooner as a trial run to see how he reacts and if he enjoys it. Then she may be more receptive to him staying ""home"".
I took my mom on vacation for her 70th. I thought she could handle it. It ended up being a week of fear because she couldn’t remember anything. She was scared to even go on the balcony. It was horrible and absolutely the wrong decision
This might indeed be an awful experience for him but she really shouldn't have to sacrifice all fun experiences in her life.  Talk to her about ways she could have a fun vacation while safely leaving him at home.  If she's certain she can handle him in an unfamiliar environment suggest that the two of them go to a hotel near their own home for a weekend and see how he handles being in an unfamiliar environment.
Even a short trip an hour away would freak my mom out.  For example, one Thanksgiving early in her diagnosis, my brother drove her an hour to my house.  She was very anxious on the short road trip, had to stop and pee twice, and once she arrived at my house, she immediately wanted to go home.  She was very fidgety during the Thanksgiving meal and it was basically an eat and run visit. 

If you decide to take him, be prepared for mishaps, disruptions, anxiety, etc.  This could be a situation where you may need to explain to the flight attendants  that your dad has dementia (will he keep a mask on in the airport and during the flight?).  Worst case - he is disruptive on the plane and your trip is compromised. I just know how my mom was and I would not have taken her on even a domestic flight. 

You should discuss these scenarios with your mom.
My mother and brother took my dad to visit my other brother. I wouldn't have attempted it myself and would have advised against it, but I wasn't consulted. It went very poorly. My dad's traveling days are over. Staying overnight anywhere but in his AL apartment throws him completely off.
We took 3 fairly big trips after my father was diagnosed.  The first one, his 3 daughters (I’m eldest) took him to Italy for 2 weeks for his 80th birthday.  He was early-ish in his diagnosis (still living alone and still driving but increasingly forgetful and confused).  It was a wonderful trip and he basked in the attention and care.  About a year later, I took him to New Orleans for 4 days.  He had always wanted to go there so I figured it was then, or never.  He was still living alone but no longer driving.  About 9 months after that, we took a family cruise to Alaska (25 - all my dad’s kids, grands and great grands).  We knew that was likely his last real trip, and it was.  He did okay but someone was assigned to him at all times.  He enjoyed the trip a lot, even though he probably couldn’t recount anything that happened.  He knew that he was with people who loved him very much.  Shortly after this, he lost his ability to live independently.  At that point, travel would be too stressful for everyone.  Now he gets anxious if he is away from home for more than an hour or so.
I've worked with a lot of dementia patients, and it really depends on the type of dementia they have, combined with their personality. 

I have know of at least one advanced case where the patient is just happy to go along with everything, and relishes the holiday. She doesn't remember them, and it's not relaxing for the family, but they still consider it worth it. Most patients already get confused and disoriented in their own homes, and would not enjoy a vacation like that.
Terrible idea, unfortunately. If he's starting to struggle, then the second you take him out of his familiar environment and routine, it can easily tip him into a crisis. At the very least, your mom won't enjoy her vacation because your dad's increased confusion (and the necessity of dealing with it) will overshadow everything. At worst, it'll trigger full on outbursts, aggression, wandering, etc. I can't overstate how dramatically they can decompensate the instant their brains have to process new environments and routines, even if they're still generally calm at home.

I feel for her and for her desire to live her life as close to normally as she can. Dementia is awful not just for what it does to the sufferer, but what it does to everyone around them, too. But a better option, if possible, might be for her to find at-home care or to put him in respite care for a week or two, so she can get away and have some kind of vacation by herself.
If you or a few family members offered to stay with your dad so your mom could vacation with less worry, that might be a nice gift
My nephew is getting married this summer & there is no way my mom is equipped to deal with the trip.  Honestly she doesn’t even remember it’s happening so no loss for her.",2022-01-30 19:38:03,NeatDescription8,sgnkhz

Dementia sucks
We lost our dad June 5th. We took care of him in his home 24/7 for 2 1/2 years. It was very hard for us to watch him deteriorate. But he was our dad and we would do it again in a heartbeat. There were funny things he used to do during this time and we all have videos and pictures. He went on hospice in April turned 90 on May 6th and died in June. He was surrounded by kids, grands, great grands and my aunt

I’m 27, my brother is 25 and my sister is 20. We’ve applied for long term care for my dad who has early onset and are waiting for a spot to become available. Just making the decision was extremely hard. I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like when he actually moves. Sending you lots of love and support. It’s natural to be sad but please don’t let it consume you. This is the journey of life and for some people like us, the journey is extra hard. You’ll get through this, you’re stronger than you think.
Sending so many gentle hugs your way. I remember that feeling when I realized I couldn't ask mom for advice anymore or even hold a real conversation with her. It's so hard. And please know that what you're feeling isn't selfish or wrong - there is no instruction manual for this journey.
You DO have a mother! Visit her as often as you can. I was 18 when my mom was diagnosed, 22 or 23 when we had to put her in a home. She died when i was 26. So, i can relate, i think

She needs you now, more than ever. Even when she doesnt recognize her, go. It will be hard, but the guilt of not going will eat at you when she passes. 

Bring her her favourite goodies from time to time, stuff like that
I’m so sorry to hear this is happening to you at such a young age. It’s totally normal for you to feel grief about not having your Mom around. It seems too soon. Hopefully you find comfort in knowing that this is what she wanted and she is getting the support she needs. Sending you a big hug. ❤️
I put my mom in assisted living this past July and the doctor took her off 3 meds in Sept and she is doing great. She has people around her talking to her, they have activities and all of that is keeping her mind active. She has nurses giving her meds at the correct time. Her blood sugar is checked 2 times a day. She is doing great! I am sure your Mom will be doing great too. You can visit her or get her an Echo 8 (sync it to your cell phone) and drop in on her and talk whenever you like. It is the best. Also when my Mom fell she yelled, “Siri call the front desk” and they answered and she was able to get help. She also called me and I was able to talk to a nurse about it.
67 is very young, I'm sorry. 

My (early 50s) dad's (now early 90s) decline has been long, slow, and steady. A good friend (mid 40s) has watched her mother (late 60s) decline rapidly and it all sucks.

I'm glad your mother was able to select a home- I keep hearing that when people go into long term memory care when they still have a lot of cognitive abilities they do so much better than moving them in after they no longer have the ability to process.
I’m about your age too. My mom will be 65 this year. I too mourn all of the things I shared with my mom. The things that my friends get to have that’s not possible for me anymore. It doesn’t get any easier. I’m sorry that this has hit your family.
It's still sad. Her acceptance of it may make this all a little easier for all involved, but it doesn't make the situation suck any less. And it's normal to think about your loss as well as hers. It's only natural to grieve what you're losing.

My dad is just a husk of a person now, and it sucks. He was the only ""sane"" parent I had. Unfortunately, my mom is kind of a mess. She means well but untreated anxiety and depression and who knows what else means she can't give emotional support, only take it. My dad was the parent I could go to for advice or support. And now I have zero parents I can rely on in that way. It sucks worse for my dad, but my dad's emotional stability was the rock that got me through childhood in the face of my mom's emotional instability, and now my rock is gone. And it sucks worse for him, but still, it hurts to see the family rock worn down to dust. So I get it.

I hope you have lots of people to talk to, or if you don't, please find them. Here, elsewhere online, friends, a therapist, an in-person support group, whatever. The more people you find who you can share your thoughts and emotions with, the easier it'll be to process what you're going through.
I went through this last year with my 70 y/o dad. He’s definitely the youngest and was very apprehensive about going at first. I felt AWFUL. But he’s been there for almost a year now and he has friends, a girlfriend(?!) and participates in a lot of the activities they offer at the retirement home. Our relationship is better too and I’m not tired/angry/resentful anymore. It’s ultimately a good thing for everything but it does take time to get used to for everyone. ♥️
It was sad taking my dad to a home … but it HAD to happen … he was a threat to himself and lord knows what would have happened had he lived by himself … you’re doing the correct thing … let the people that do that for a living help you out … its so much to carry … and it will overwhelm … not only the physical requirements but the emotional ones too … My dad fought it in the beginning, but then settled in and met some friends and caring nurses … after my mother died (very suddenly) he snapped and went directly into middle spectrum dementia … I couldn’t live and take care of him and my sister has severe depression stemming from our mothers sudden passing. Dad, refused to give up driving, and with no one to take care of him, he got in a terrible car accident … I understand the sadness … but its a blessing that there are those out there to help …
My partner's mom is in a nursing home and is only 59. Diagnosed at 54. Not married. It's very unfair to all. Feel free to join us on this discord for Young Adults coping with loved ones with alzheimers/dementia.

Dementia,"Confusion after waking, especially in the evening hours","So my great grandmother hasn't been diagnosed clinically with dementia, but we're 99 percent sure she having early stages of it.

Sometimes she'll ask us who lives in the house with us, where she is, that the house doesn't actually feel like our home. She's having a hard time recognizing voices aswell","This is very common and sounds like it’s actually beyond the early stages. Increased confusion in the late afternoon/early evening is often referred to as “sundowning.”
In your title you mentioned ""confusion after waking"" ... about the only time my mother seems to hallucinate (be up& sounding clear & sharp, but saying nonsensical things) is when she falls asleep watching an 8pm show on her bed (or similar). She often then wakes about 9:15 or 9:30pm  and asks about family members who aren't there and whether we need to leave the door unlocked for them, etc.",2022-01-30 17:30:43,kumori_77,sgkvbt
Dementia,It’s finally time to move Grandma to memory care but how?,"My grandmas mental state has declined so rapidly in the last month. She has been fine living in her house with cameras that we set up for the last couple years (front yard, back porch, living room/kitchen, no bedroom or bathroom). This month it seems like she changes each week, getting so much worse. She’s gotten a lot angrier and keeps telling us she’s got all these children she has to care for. Shes forgetting to eat and becoming a lot more hostile towards us. 

We’ve been weighing our options and sending her to a facility is the best way because she needs 24/7 care. It breaks my heart knowing what has to be done but she needs the help. My mom and aunts are dragging their feet because my papa passed after being in a facility for 6 months. They worry putting grandma in one will kill her quicker than her staying in her home. 

What’s the least painful way to approach this?","[deleted]
First, examine the possibilities;

1.  Can you afford in-home caregivers and/or can your mom and aunts take turns caring for her?  

2.  Can she move in with your mom or aunts?  

3. What care facility in the area fits all of your needs the best. 

It's really easy to keep kicking the can down the road until a crisis makes a move necessary.  It's what most people do and then they have to figure out what to do when they pick their parent up from the ER and realize that they can't safely take them home.  People die soon after being put into homes often because the caregivers wait until the last possible moment; they may have died even sooner if left at home.  There's no way to say that moving their father into a home didn't actually *extend* his life.
Memory care will likely give her the opportunity to socialize with other people beyond the family, which is something she is missing at home.
We are in same boat with my dad.  He’s been ok living “alone” which is essentially a small back house behind my sister’s house (entire lot is 7500 sq ft so we are talking a matter of a few yards from her house to his).  About 6 months ago, we added cameras to living room, dining room, kitchen, office, front and back porches.  His decline, after quite a few years of stability, has been breathtaking these last couple of months.  We had hoped we would be able to keep him home for most, maybe all, of his life.  But, it is becoming pretty clear that he needs to be somewhere more structured.  He doesn’t have much money, maybe enough for 2-3 years but that might be all he has left anyway.  (If we knew how long he would live, it would be a rather simple math problem, but alas…..).  He also has an 80 lb golden retriever to which he is devoted and it would be unconscionable to separate them, so we would need a place that allows a large dog.  The dog is pretty old so that might not be an issue for a whole lot longer.
Sometimes you've got to place the blame on others, like saying the doctor needs her to stay in a facility for a few weeks to help her with whatever you come up with. Then ""kick the can down the road"" until she stops asking. It sounds a little bit cold but if she's resistant to the idea, it's not going to be easy no matter how you do it. If you go with something like this, be sure you tell the facility so no one counters it.
We had to use this with my mom and she bragged to a nurse who was just covering because someone called in sick and the woman was one of those ""I don't lie, patients must be reoriented to my reality"" types . When Mom told her she was just there until the doctor said she was walking well enough to go home, the nurse told her she was wrong, that she was in there forever until she died. Not fun to come in and find your mom in tears. Had a chat with the head nurse, the nurse was not allowed in their unit again.

Just offhand, have you had her checked for a UTI? That can change behavior and cause things to escalate.
Anger is a symptom of dementia. They are angry at their loss of memory.  They are angry about changes in their life. They are angry about moving someplace new.  We placed my elderly cousin, Betty, 89, in assisted living last summer. She lived with her best friend, who is also elderly, but of sound mind.  The roommate couldn't handle caregiving so the family found an assisted living building for Betty.  And boy was she mad!  She didn't want to move from her friend's home.  She didn't understand why none of us moved her in with us. She was furious that she couldn't be independent.  We took her with us to visit the apartment and she conceded that it was a nice place. Then, of course forgot all about it. But move her we did. And surprise, she actually loved it.  They had great food and activities. She made new friends.   On warm days, she and a friend would walk in the building's garden, then sit on the patio and chat. A couple of days after the move, she said she realized it was the right thing and thanked me for doing it. So you have to do what is right, but understand there could be some rough spots along the way.",2022-01-30 14:59:40,Izthefrizz,sghf2x
Dementia,Is it hallucinations?,"My Nanna is not a typical case as her dementia is secondary to a nuerologocal disease (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy). She is being cared for by palliative care and nursed for at home by my Mum and myself. Lately, as her dementia has progressed, I'm not sure if she is hallucinating or filling in the missing parts of her memory with what she thinks is should/could be. Like, she sees someone in a hi-vis workshop and decides its her favourite son. But then she comes out with whole narratives about how my cousins (who she shan't seen in months) have new jobs or their exes are after them etc. It leaves Mum and I saying WTF a fair few times each day lol","My g-ma does a version of this. I think your first theory sounds like the more probable answer. Grandma has a guitar. Has had if since the 70s. And yet she tell me once or twice a week how this man just walked in the front door and set that guitar down and just walked out. Sometimes it's a stranger, sometimes it's her son. Sometimes it's another grandson, sometimes it's the mail man. I think it's and empty spot in their memory so they fill it with the ones they have. I've never corrected her tho unless she thinks it was ""a stranger"" just because idk I guess I don't want her to think strangers come in and out. Lol.
I call my grandma at her home every day when I leave work and every day without fail she tries to tell me something like ""my niece [my name] and I went out shopping today and we saw my sister [my mom's name] and now I'm waiting for someone to take me home"". In reality I was at work an hour away from where she lives and she was probably asleep in her recliner at her home. The wtf feeling is normal lol
My mom just did this yesterday (again), she does it quite often. We were watching Hamilton on cable tv and she was telling us how she remembered traveling to the city with a group on a charter bus to watch the theater production of Hamilton, but she couldn’t remember how it ended. She has had significant dementia for a good 4 years but hasn’t done a charter activity in almost 15 years. Granted her assisted living facility does have a TV channel where they show a variety of programs, so there is a small chance she saw it there, but I think it was really just a memory gap filler.

What really gets under my skin that I have to just let go (let it go, let it go…) is when she tells people there is nothing going on at her assisted living facility, that they all just sit in their apartments and only come out at mealtimes. Early pandemic that was the case but within the last 15 months or so they are back to several daily activities, outings, etc which I highlight on her monthly activities calendar - and I know she goes because she specifically shows me her craft projects.
I am my great uncles caregiver and he makes up the most insane stories of his loved ones that I can see in his eyes he 100% believes. He's told me how these 4 guys broke into the house and killed his mom and how he killed them when in fact that's not true because his mom passed away with dementia. I think what happened there is he might have seen something similar on tv at some point and confused that with his actual reality. Its strange when he goes into his wild stories because most of his simple sentences are word salad.
PSP is a hard diagnosis.  I'm sorry you and your nanna are going through this.  What you described sounds like false memories and maybe confabulation.  Hallucinations would be more like if she is presently seeing something when you're in the room with her.",2022-01-30 07:01:04,entitledbossbitch,sg7s9d
Dementia,Is seeing ghosts a sign of dementia?,"I haven’t spoken to my father in over a year, and he lives in another state. I recently called him and he mentioned his home is filled with over a 100 ghosts, he explained that other people can’t see them, but they sit in his chair go through walls and they sometimes look like a swarm of flies and turn into ghosts. He also mentioned he has started playing publishing clearing house sweepstakes and won 14 million but he hasn’t gotten his money yet. He says he fills out surveys every night on his phone. Could his eyes be affected by the constant looking at surveys? I’ve never known him to get into sweepstakes marketing so it’s a strange development. I’m concerned that something is going on with his health or mental health and I’m not sure what to do at this point. Has anyone seen seeing ghosts and entertaining sweepstakes and money scams as early signs of dementia?","2 things:

1. Lewy body dementia can cause hallucinations.

2. Please make sure there isn't a gas leak! Carbon monoxide poisoning can also cause people to see things (including ghosts!). Fascinating read or listen that has always stuck with me: https://www.npr.org/transcripts/533791342#:~:text=So%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning%20is,an%20unexplained%20feeling%20of%20dread.
I'm not sure if anything specific in your post is a SURE sign of dementia on its own, but the whole of it does seem to be indicative of dementia.

That's the funny thing about this disease. Any ONE thing could be explained away; and so often it is. But it's the big picture that is sometimes missed. That is what more professionals should see.

ETA: It wasn't that long ago my step-father was still agreeing with evaluating professionals (doctors, etc) and using the phrase ""possible dementia."" Yet here we are with my mother on her deathbed. Maybe she is just ""possibly dying.""

I wish there was not so much of a stigma with all kinds of mental health and people could feel free to seek help prior to this becoming a terminal disease.
The susceptibility to scams is very common among older people generally, but it is a textbook symptom for dementia. You should become an authorized user for his online banking so you can log in and check for strange transactions. 

In 2016 my grandmother seemed basically fine until she was hospitalized and in PT rehab for a month due to shingles (she had refused the shingrix vaccine to save a few bucks). So we checked her mail and slowly discovered that she was wrapped up in a scam and had lost some $20,000. And we managed to stop the bleeding. 

He should get his vision checked possibly by an ophthalmologist. He may see floaters or an aura which triggers the ghost hallucination if his brain is already vulnerable. 

I hope you do start talking to your dad more often. Socializing, activities, and discussion of complex, interesting, nuanced topics is important for staving this off as long as possible.
I am very familiar with the PCH scam. My mom almost lost $8500. I spoke to the scammer because he called her house on Thanksgiving day and we all happened to be there
You may consider getting Informed Delivery for his mailing addresses and online banking, and have it sent to an email account which your sister and you both have access to. Really you should maintain an email address (don't just use your person one) for all his medical portals and paperwork regardless and have it forward to your email.
TLDR: Macular degeneration can also cause hallucinations.

My grandmother once confided in me that she saw a cat sitting next to my chair. She knew it wasn't real, but wasn't frightened by it as it looked just like a cat she had when she was a girl.  I called my Dad about it.  He just laughed and said that the ophthalmologist had warned him about that.  When part of the vision field is disrupted (as with Mac D), the brain will often substitute an image from memory.   It's common enough to have a name: [Charles Bonnet Syndrome](https://www.macularsociety.org/macular-disease/macular-conditions/charles-bonnet-syndrome/)
My grandmother saw her dead children as teenagers hanging around her house- they all were stillborn or died as babies. She also saw fairies and some military guy would show up randomly and hang around. After a very long, drawn out process of denial by my mom and uncles, swearing it was a gas leak, her meds, etc. she was diagnosed with dementia but no real name put to it. 

Kind of a side story that was funny about this whole time period... Her tv had been hit by lightning and she'd had it repaired. While she was having the ghost hallucinations she mentioned her tv was randomly coming on but there was no sound and it wouldn't respond to the remote, after a while it'd shut off. It sounded like another one of her stories. Fast forward, after she was gone, I got married and inherited the tv. One morning I was getting up and as I walked through the living room, the tv came on, no sound, wouldn't respond to the remote. Kinda freaked me out a bit. I sent an apology Grandma's way for thinking that was part of her dementia.

Mom saw people trying to break into things on her property. She ""saw""the neighbor shooting her cats in the yard... Cats that were in the house with her at the time. Usually if these kinds of things were going on it was a combo of dementia and a UTI. We grew to appreciate the hallucinations as a way to let us know she needed to be tested.
Hi there! 👋🙂 I've been a caregiver for 3 years now. I'm not that experienced but I do take care of a patient that has hallucinated a cat (audio and visual) and she always claims to see a woman. Ghost? Maybe. Hallucinating? Possibly. We may never know.
My grandmother sees people all the time and she has been diagnosed with LBD. She doesn’t say the word ghosts, but she is constantly seeing people that aren’t there. She also was falling for scams over the phone, before we disconnected her line (she lives with my parents). I always attributed that to the overwhelming number of scam calls everyone gets these days and the fact that she isn’t savvy to things like that, but looking back - I’m sure her LBD played a role in her falling for those scams. I couldn’t say for sure that your father has dementia, but I think there is enough reason for concern to get a doctor’s appointment on the books.
My dad has had vivid hallucinations and it was extremely difficult to separate them from reality at a distance, even when he's reading in a facility. We never knew ""who"" would answer the phone or what mood he would have. It was a wild rollercoaster.

They rebalanced his meds and reduced them to one major and a few minor recurring hallucinations. The major one is an imaginary good-for-nothing staff member who eats his food and keeps dad from getting packages. (Basically a freedom and happiness dream) A minor one is also partially true - A woman on his memory ward tends to wander from room-to-room looking at stuff, just curious. In his hallucinations, she's a thief who gets blamed for all the stuff he misplaced. To him both are very real.

It's terribly difficult being 1700 miles away with my own medical issues. With the careful care he's getting in the home, we and he knows he getting good care, but the separation hurts while we see him slowly fade into dementia hell.

The others have given excellent suggestions and I hope you get good and swift resolution soon!",2022-01-30 00:22:36,MrsSpot,sg1q88
Dementia,Advice for first neurologist visit?,"Hi I'm new here, dealing with a family member who is likely in the beginning stages of dementia. Thanks to covid we had to wait a long time to get her to a neurologist, but the appointment is around the corner. What can we expect?

What I'm mainly concerned about is that since she doesn't believe anything is wrong, she will downplay everything to the doctor. A family member will be present with her at the appointment so she doesn't go alone. Ideally we'd be allowed to speak the doctor privately without her present, because some of the things that need to be said are uncomfortable to say in front of her. For example, I think it needs to be pointed out that she has basically stopped bathing aside from washing her hair in the sink with dish soap, but that's kind of embarrassing to bring up in front of her.

I guess overall I just don't know what to do if she doesn't think anything is wrong, and I was hopeful that we'd get a definitive diagnosis (maybe not from this first visit, but eventually?) that would help her understand what's going on and realize she needs more help. She is making all of these grand plans for her life that absolutely should not happen with how bad off she is right now. For example, she wants to adopt a dog, but she couldn't even take care of her cat and we had to rehome it. She wants to buy a house, but she can barely manage an apartment at the moment (it's starting to look like an episode of Hoarders). She couldn't handle her finances at all so we've already taken over that for her. IMO she needs to move to a retirement community that has a memory care unit that she can eventually transition to if/when she gets worse, but she is NOT receptive to that idea at all.

Anyway thanks in advance for any advice, and for just for letting me rant a bit (figured this community would be understanding).","I want to start off by saying that not all neurologists are made equal, unfortunately. My grandma visited 2 neurologists because the first one was completely incompetent. Even with her dementia diagnosis and low MMSE score, he said ""she has the memory of an 80 year old"" after a 2 minute phone conversation. It was very disturbing how he considered himself a doctor but knew nothing about dementia/Alzheimer's.

Luckily, I was able to take her to a second neurologist associated with one of the larger hospitals in her area, and this visit was much more thorough and ""by the book."" They actually had me sit in a different room while my grandma and her interpreter spoke to the neurologist. He performed several assessments over the course of maybe...an hour or so? It was long, but I was really grateful for his thoroughness. After the assessment, the doctor spoke to me in private.

Afterwards, I joined my grandma and the doctor told us the results of her assessment which clearly showed mid-stage dementia. It was at this appointment that it finally sank in with my grandmother that she had severe cognitive decline and that living in her home alone was no longer an option. This was also when my grandma asked me to find her a memory care facility, of her own volition.

So if the first appointment doesn't go as planned, consider finding a more reputable neurologist that's well-reviewed. A good neurologist will be thorough, and really take their time speaking to both the patient as well as their family members to get a good picture of what's going on.
It might be helpful to write out your concerns to give to the receptionist or nurse, prior to her being called back. My dad had dementia and not bathing was one of the red flags for us. He would also get belligerent if it was brought, he always said he did it yesterday. Ironically, he finally gave in and let me do a ""bowl bath"", but a very thorough one, once a week. Me, not my brothers, but it worked out and then eventually we moved in to take care of him at home, rather than place him

Dementia sucks
It's great that you're able to get her in to see a neurologist! In my experience, the neurologist knows what they're looking for and can often see through the patient trying to minimize their issues. Ours asked a long series of questions and did memory assessments so my grandmother's insistence that she was just fine couldn't cover up the cold hard facts. Ours asked questions about what year, date, day, and season it was and had her try to remember three words/repeat them back a short time later. There were other conversations and questions that helped the neurologist observe her thought processes and reasoning. We had the opportunity to talk to the neurologist separately, as well, but I'm not sure if that's the usual procedure. Maybe you can email the doctor directly with concerns?

I had many of the same questions and apprehensions before our first appointment but the professionalism and experience of the doctor helped a lot. I hope you have similar luck!
Come with a narrative: Detail your concerns, get a rough timeline of when symptoms began, sudden behavior changes, etc

Pay attention and ask questions: Depending on your situation your loved one could be frightened, angry, or a combination of both. They may shut down, and in my experience it turns into ""just talk to them"". I did everything I needed to do to ensure my mother had a say, and most of the evals were done one on one so I was in the lobby once they began. 

Do not allow misinformation: You are there to QA/QC the information given to the neurologist. Current medications, behaviors, etc, must be as accurate as possible. There were times where I had to interject and say no that is not true (sleeping and eating habits, remembering meds, they can still drive, etc). It is awkward and painful to have to do, but you CANNOT give the doctor false information otherwise you run the risk of being stuck with a faulty diagnosis and medication program for 6-8wks until the follow up evaluation

Support your loved one: This is most important in my eyes. From the time you suggest the neurologist visit, to when you get in the car, to when you leave the office....make sure they know you are there to support them. This is what I did with my dad before he died of cancer and what I've done for my mom. My parents already trusted me but it was important for me to reiterate this because it's easy to become distressed and depressed after a diagnosis like this

That's just off the top of my head, but also keep in mind you will also going through some shit so don't forget to take care of yourself. Good luck, lemme know if this helped.
If you’re thinking of getting a long term care insurance policy for her, you must purchase it BEFORE SHE IS DIAGNOSED. You will also want to get POA, advanced directive, medicaid-protected trusts, and will  all in place before any diagnosis. If you tell them about the dementia diagnosis then do the paperwork, they may think you are trying to gaslight and scam them.

You can ask to speak on the phone with the physician and list your concerns and the strange behavior you have observed. The family member will likely get every brain cell to fall in line for exactly 30 minutes while that doctor speaks to them. Get a list of all medications they are on (and actually regularly taking) including over the counter. Benadryl seems innocuous as a sleeping pill but it really harms seniors cognition in the long term. Ask for brain scans to be ordered before any diagnosis is firm.
Honestly, I would recommend writing out a letter to hand to the medical assistant who takes your grandmother‘s vitals to specifically to give it to the neurologist prior to the visit.

You need to really make the letter concise yet chock-full of information that is useful and specify what you hope to gain from this visit.

For example:
Who the person is attending with your loved one.
Who is your loved one, including a brief history of her medical problems and life story.
Your primary concern that brought you to this visit.
What you have observed that gave you these concerns.
What you are hoping the doctor will help you with (tests, diagnoses, medicine, social management).
A general idea of what you hope in term of a plan.

As a gross general made up example –

Dear Dr. Neurologist,
My name is Adam Smith, I am the son of Mom Smith who is my mother. She’s 85 years old, has a high school education, worked as a secretary for 15 years, and a homemaker after that to care for her 4 children. Her husband died three years ago. Current medical problems include hypertension, diabetes and gout. 

We are here today because we see her having more difficulty with day to day independent living and are worried about dementia. Specifically, some of the things we notice include lack of bathing (other than washing her hair in the sink with dishwashing liquid), not eating, leaving food around and general untidiness (tending towards hoarding). We started to notice this about a year ago and we’re getting worried about the situation. She talks grand plans about buying a house and getting a dog but we think she needs some type of assisted living and we are not able to provide her with direct care. We have been doing our best to help (for example paying bills and general housework) but we are looking for a longer term comprehensive solution.

We are hoping that you can help us understand what is going on. What are the steps for diagnosis and the general course of this in your experience?

Thank you,
Concerned family member

In my experience getting some of this information on paper for them may help speed up the care because I don’t have to take 45 minutes prying it out of you and your family member. They’ll still ask questions that overlap with your letter but that is appropriate and you can let your loved one do the talking and not worry that you haven’t gotten your concerns across. You really need your family member to “shine” during their time with the doctor if you catch my drift.

Social aspects of care are really not doctor territory but they may be able to point you towards social workers or other groups that you can look into if you haven’t already.

Edit- Sorry, technical issues. Deleted first comment and reposted. More edits for typos.
TBH a lot of these grand plans are plans dementia patients make but lack any capability of actually carrying out.
I really hope that you get everything you want from the neurologist visit. Just be prepared that  a diagnosis will still not convince your loved one that anything is wrong. You don't really have to make her understand her limits, she can't understand them. You will just have to learn some techniques like ""therapeutic fibbing"" to keep her safe and comfortable. Maybe you can hire someone to help out and lighten your load.

Taking care of your relative will be difficult, frustrating and unfair, with some guilt thrown in. Hopefully you have a relative you can share your difficulties with, or you maybe can find a support group. You are obviously kind, caring and concerned. Dementia is horrible.
Oh goodness... are you me? My mother has stopped bathing and doing laundry, stopped cooking, has no working fridge, no running water, no working stove, no heat, no ROOF in the kitchen, keeps no food in the house... revoked driver's license but won't stop driving...has a dog that is in such bad health it should be a felony charge, could go on...

But yes I've taken her to a regular MD general practitioner, and she was able to downplay, misdirect, and fake her way through a ""mental"" exam that a drunk chimpanzee could have passed. 

The Dr. signed off on her being physically and mentally competent to drive... despite the fact that 2 months later she now has 5 tickets in 3 counties.

 Each ticket for; driving on revoked license + expired tags + weaving in her lane + no insurance. 

I need to get her to a specialist of course. 

But I'm like you - worried about my mother's ability to fake being a sane-ish person for a 30 minute doctor appointment.

I guess I'm going to sneak around and take pictures around her house, maybe record some phone conversations? Take pictures of her neglected feral animals..  take pictures of the inside of her rolling trash heap of a truck and the multiple citations she's been issued... Sneakily give copies to the doctor when we meet him.
A good measure of a neurologist is the waiting room.  If there are plug-in air fresheners you have a bad one.  Neruos work with people who have chronic migraines, but they also write prescriptions for scheduled drugs.  This means SOME nerous just want that cash (there will also be all sorts of signage regarding prescriptions in the waiting room) and they don't care about the health of their patients. 

&#x200B;

Another bonus is how easy it is for an elderly person to get around in the waiting room.

&#x200B;

As far as what to do, the first visit will probably be talking to you or a MoCA test to see where she is at.  If it is a MoCA test first you will need to sit on your hands and don't talk or help.
Insist on getting brain imaging done - cortical atrophy may already be visible; if not, you at least have a baseline for future comparison. Any cognitive tests done will also be useful as baselines, so make sure you get documentation of what tests were administered and the scores.

Also: if there is any chance for your relative to get long-term care insurance get it NOW before they have a diagnosis!!

I remember my mother's the first visit to a neurologist. She acted amused about our insistence that she be screened for cognitive problems. ""My daughters think I have MEMORY problems"" she told the Dr., with a smile and an exaggerated eye-roll.  She did great on all the tests administered then - short term memory was fine, she was oriented and alert. She didn't have Alzheimer's. What she did have was most likely a form of fronto-temporal lobe degeneration, which presents not so much as memory problems but a decline in executive functioning, a loss of inhibition, overall regression in social skills. Later, the memory goes.  

Bathing-refusal was a definite symptom. She would insist she didn't need to take showers, or wash her hair. 

Don't be surprised if there's no diagnosis at this first visit. Insist on a follow-up appt in at least 3 months.",2022-01-29 19:44:19,primemodel,sfweaj
Dementia,Anybody else going through the electrical socket battle?,"Hey all,

Anybody else caring for somebody who has a natural tendency to just pull whatever plug they see out of the socket with no rhyme or reason? For me it was kind of endearing at first because it was their way of ""helping save electricity"", but it's slowly evolving into ""let me unplug this and hide the electronic device"", which is problematic because they disconnect the cord and put them separate from the device.

This is more of a rant bc I know it's not a huge deal and in a way it's funny but damn it gets frustrating trying to track everything down or coming back to the house and having nothing turn on lol","I've went through this once where my loved became obsessed with unplugging everything before we could leave the house. Eventually that habit stopped due to his decline. Now on the opposite end of the spectrum I'm having to hide electrical outlets or use outlet covers because he has tried to poke his keys in them which lead to me taking away his keys that was a challenge but he forgot about the keys in time. Its interesting,funny and sad  to see what a person with dementia will fixate on or you never know what might become problematic.
My father would unplug and hide every nightlight in the house. Good times.
Yep! I ended up getting an outlet protector (designed for outside use, but it has a lock) and a surge protector cover/ cable management kit. By hiding the cables in his room, I mostly stopped him from unplugging everything.
My mom was the same. TV, electric toothbrush, nightlights—if it was plugged in, it had to be unplugged. And the nightlights were always “put away” in some ridiculous spot. The worst was her wallet, though. She was convinced someone was going to steal it for the few dollars she kept in it, and boy could she find some creative hiding places! She would get very upset when she couldn’t find it, and wouldn’t settle until we turned her whole room upside down. We eventually bought a few copies of the same wallet for the times we just couldn’t locate it.
This happened with my mother in law. We figured out it was because she was starting to have trouble sometimes remembering how to turn things off. So I taped all the cords down and got big buttons for all the lights and the tv and taped them in very visible places next to whatever thing they controlled. Now all she has to do is push the button to turn things off and on and things have gotten much better. She hasn’t pulled the plugs out in several months now. 

This is the one I got.

Dementia,Dimentai at age 58?,"So my father forgets a lot since he was a child, but in the last couple of years I noticed he's having hard time with working memory. He works as a sales person at his pastry shop, he does mistakes in calculation 2/3 of times. Especially when there are multiple orders. I
n the past 2 days, he forgot the car's key inside the car and didn't lock it. Also last week he left the pastry shop without locking it. It was literally open for theives. I took him to a neurologist last year but he assured that nothing is wrong, he asked him easy stuff like name, date and what did he ate. 2 months ago, the cardiologist ordered a sleep test to rule out sleep apnea, but it showed a mild sleep apnea.. I don't think this is the real cause..","This is basically the same post you made 3 months ago. Is he still leaving the shop unlocked or are you repeating old information?  What have you noticed since then? Was anyone able to go to the neurologist to share specific examples of troubling incidents? If so, what were those incidents?

I will tell you that I was concerned enough to demand an MRI for my husband back in 2018. I was worried he had a brain tumor since his dad had died of brain cancer. His primary care did that, saw nothing, and decided it was depression causing the things I brought up. Two years later, I finally got doctors to see what I was seeing, was referred to a neurologist, and by then it had progressed enough that the neurologist pretty quickly caught on that there was cognitive impairment. By then, I was also able to give more concrete examples of what I was witnessing.
I know two people in that age group with dementia. Actually they were both diagnosed at age 54. One man with Alzheimer’s and one with Lewy Body Dementia. So yes, it’s possible.
When I wrote up the story of the first photobiomodulation patient (phototherapy), he was already in severe decline at age 57. It's more common than you would think. I'm 59 and feel like when my grandmother was 59, she was ancient. A lot of damage can happen by age 58. Hope you get him checked.
I could be wrong on this, but I believe it's helpful to get a baseline MRI, so you can compare a few years down the road.

Anyone can have ONE of such lapse once in a blue moon. At 85, cognitive processing slows, sometimes stutters like an old car backfiring in the morning. I'm watching it in myself, and have just passed 65. Have slipped about 1%; reaction time slower, familiar texts, authors, dates ""on the tip of my tongue,"" but feels like I've got an old, slow hard drive running in the CPU.

Frequent lapses may not ""be"" dementia, but aging brain as (comparative) disability; are there accommodations you can set up? Like, a big-button calculator, highly visible on service counter. A system of ""take a number"" tickets like they have in delis, so customers will wait their turn and not rush him. A set of memnonics you can get him to follow about locking stuff? (Like, a coiled wristband for his car key—make it a habit to wear on wrist after parking; a simple habit like rattling the doorknob 3x to check it's locked, which is what I've used for many years.)
Any likely causes?  I believe the big ones are:

\-poor dental hygiene (gum pockets >3 mm or even deeper could cause longstanding inflammation now known to be associated with later dementia), curiously, bleeding gums have not been associated with developing dementia

\-diet:  habitually eating processed meats, while (a recognized preventive step on average) not eating eight or more servings per day of veggies and fruits).  A consistent and steady diet of varied antioxidant containing foods is a very healthy practice.  Along with green tea and nuts in moderation.

My own view is:  also pay attention to France (wine drinkers, but I drink concord grape juice, same impact) and India (curry eaters, so I eat turmeric a bland yellow spice).  Both countries have notably lower rates of dementia, thought closely related to those drink/food choices.  Can't hurt, might help (a lot).

A possible small but quick fix:  his B12 may be low (easy blood test), aim for supplements to get him up to a 'high normal level', harmless to take anyway.
Unfortunately dementia is possible at this age. Try to notice his functioning in other areas; does he remember appointments, grocery lists, taking medications, cooking, using simple things like a microwave. Have his symptoms started suddenly or are they more gradual. Sometimes depression can also cause memory issues and manifest itself as dementia. I would also recommend to see a different neurologist.",2022-01-28 18:55:01,ezio313,sf4hhx
Dementia,Do SAD lamps help with late afternoon/evening upset caused by sundowning?,,"I have full spectrum light bulbs (cheaper than buying a new lamp) and have been using them pre-dementia.  No notable difference, however there was no ""control"", thus not a proper experiment. 

&#x200B;

What really helped is medication.  Why is this sub not talking about medication?  (along with early detection)
We just kept everything very light with our regular lamps. I cut them off slowly moving toward bedtime. We made sure that she was actively engaged from about 3:30 until after dinner. She was not able to do anything on her own like a puzzle unless she was in the kitchen with me and I could help her a lot. She really needed someone nearby. 

We had to play with her medication until we found the right dosage. Everything together finally gave us some relief.
They can help but in my opinion they're not the best method for a couple of reasons.

In order for a SAD lamp to work, the person has to allow light through the eyes for 20-30 minutes, depending on power of lamp and distance from bulbs.

Not that you look AT the light but it needs to get through the eyes to the brain. 

This type of light is in the blue range, and there are versions that are ""full spectrum"" but the science is based on blue light.

Do you know how computer screens and mobile phone blue light keeps us awake at night? That's what SAD lights are doing. It's working on the same pathways.

When we absorb certain wavelengths of blue light, our circadian clock says it's time to suppress melatonin because it's daytime. Since sundowning is around 4pm, the SAD light messes with the circadian clock with an opposing message -- suppress sleepiness at 4pm.

There is some evidence (not nearly the quantity for blue light) that red and infrared light can produce the same positive effect without the blue light downsides.",2022-01-28 16:19:00,Its0nlyAPaperMoon,sf10td

Dementia,my grandparents were so smart,"hi. i just wanted to vent tbh because i don’t really know anywhere else i can vent where people could relate. my grandma has Lewy Body Dementia and my grandpa has Alzheimer’s. before the disease, my grandma taught me how to play the piano. She loved singing, keeping up with her friends on Facebook, and she loved church. I’d go over to my grandparents’ house on Fridays and she would tell me countless stories about Cuba (we’re Cuban lol). She loved getting dressed up and taking care of herself and now she’s a hollow shell. She obviously doesn’t remember any part of who she used to be and she’s like a little girl. I just miss her so much. My grandpa still recognizes me more. He used to help me with my math homework, go on walks with me and the dog, and go on every single ride at Disney World with me. They’re both in an Assisted Living Facility with Memory Care as the disease was progressing too much in both of them. The facility isn’t allowing visitors anymore due to Covid and it’s breaking my heart to think of them there alone. I never want them to think we abandoned them. My dad had to put them in a facility because he works 60+ hours a week and couldn’t give them 24/7 care and I’m in college so I couldn’t be as much help as I would’ve wanted. I just really miss them so much. These memory diseases strip you away of everything that made you yourself. :(","Sorry to hear about your grandparents. Hopefully we're coming to the end of all the Covid restrictions and you'll be able to go see them soon. Luckily you made a ton of great memories with them. Dementia sucks.
Hugs to you. Dementia is heartless.
[deleted]
I'm so sorry about your grandparents. Dementia takes so much, so unfairly. And while it's awful that you can't visit them, please take some comfort in knowing that they are in a safe place. I hope you and your dad can support each other through the rest of this.
So sorry to hear. Hopefully you are able to visit a bit more often but appreciate this while covid baloney makes stuff difficult.",2022-01-28 02:17:31,elmamutsehizomierda,sekyek
Dementia,Do medications to slow dementia seem to be very useful in your experience?,"A family member was just diagnosed and is refusing the medication offered by the doctor (I think because then it becomes real for them). Just wondering if we should push the issue, if it makes a huge difference. Thanks.","When my mom was diagnosed in the summer of 2020, we were told the medication could buy us a year, that—although meds couldn't stop the disease—they could slow the progression. The year was still challenging in some ways, but looking back it was so good. My mom is now at mid-stage and will be moving to assisted living soon. 

I do believe the meds did their job. Best of luck to you and your family member. It's a tough road.
When my great uncle was diagnosed with vascular dementia around the end of 2020 he was prescribed donepezil to slow his dementia. From what our experience is with him on the medication is it did work til about July of 2021 when his cognitive decline progressed. He's now on 10mg of donepezil but I can tell its not even touching his dementia as he's gotten worse. I keep him on it because maybe it helps some in ways I don't see maybe he'd be worse without it I'm not sure. The medications I know that work are his mood stabilizers. At this point keeping him calm and happy is what I care about most. He's on Citalopram for his depression and anxiety. Seroquel to help with sundowning. Lamotrigine for his bipolar. Xanax is given to him when he needs to be calmed down further.
Helped my 78 y.o. mom!  My experience showed it's important to rule out UTI (urinary tract infection) which caused my mom to hallucinate and become physically aggressive. After that got addressed (several rounds of antibiotics & learning she was incontinent) the dementia meds helped.  She has a flattened affect but recalls some things from conversations (Are we still bathing the dog today? Can we get more yogurt?)   which she could not do before the meds.   Lots of factors including the orogression of the disease. Wish you well!
Depends how far the disease has progressed. My dad’s neurologist prescribed something for him, name escapes me right now. By the time he got it, he was too far along. My aunt, his sister was taking him to his appointments at that time and I think it was more for her. After a year, the pharmacist told me it was only supposed to be taken for a year and said we were wasting money, but it wasn’t harmful to him.
My mom was on Memantine. It didn't help much that I noticed, but then again we couldn't exactly get a side by side comparison of how much she'd have progressed without it, so I really don't know.
My parent stopped the meds due to side effects (tried Donepezil and Galantamine).
Consider putting the meds in those weekly/daily med packs (four or five weeks at a time so they never have to see the bottle) with vitamins
We started giving Seroquel and Aricept to my grandmother along with her antibiotics for UTI which she accepted, so she got in the habit of taking them all together. Yes they do help a lot to take the edge off.
I get sad and angry reading this thread. Since my wife has refused to see a Dr about her obvious issues  and has for the last nearly five years, this train has left the station. Just a vent. Thanks",2022-01-28 00:41:00,Anticrepuscular_Ray,sejemy
Dementia,Having a rough time,"My dad, 73, has vascular dementia and has been living in a facility in Florida since 2019. In the past week he’s had three aggressive incidents (not out of the norm for but way more than normal) and they are trying everything they can to kick him out. Granted, at this point I don’t want him living there anymore, but they keep trying to put him in a psych hold. 

Im trying to find him a new place to live but memory care is so expensive So I’m not sure what we can afford. So I’m not even sure where I can place him. The VA state home doesn’t have any beds near by. 

A system that allows this to happen to one of its most vulnerable members is a cruel one.","Has he had his medication re-evaluated by his neurologist? Maybe he/she can make some tweaks to help with the outbursts. Aggression is often a part of agitation which can sometimes be helped by meds
Are you against addressing this as a psychiatric issue?  Every facility will have the same requirement: the aggression needs to be treated. It puts their staff and other patients at risk and it's not pleasant for your Dad either. Once he is asked to leave one facility because of aggression if will become very difficult to find a new placement ESPECIALLY if nothing has been done to treat the aggression. It can be a good sign if his current facility is recommending psychiatric attention and saying they will work with controlling the aggression with meds so that he can stay in their facility.
We are not a society that takes care of our most vulnerable. It's terrible.",2022-01-27 23:05:25,Adverbage,sehokc
Dementia,What can I proactively do while I’m young to lessen the chances of getting Alzheimers when I’m old?,"I lived with a sweet old couple for a couple months a little while ago. The husband has dementia and his wife was taking care of him.

She used to tell me stories about her husband - his success, intelligence, and general business acumen. I could feel the heart break behind her words as her husband had clearly deteriorated over the years to resemble less and less of the person she described..

Getting alzheimers/dementia honestly terrifies me. 

As far as I know, it doesn’t run in my family from my dad’s side.

But my mum was estranged from her family at birth, and I don’t know if it runs in her family.

I’m 34. Is there something I can start doing now to lessen the risks of getting it later?","I'm 31 and dementia runs in my family unfortunately. Ive looked into this topic via internet research and found a healthy diet and exercise on a daily basis couldn't hurt. Keeping the mind sharp by always trying to learn new challenging things. Maintaining stress levels and taking care of your mental health. Remain socially active. Having your hearing and eyesight checked cause I've read hearing loss can aid in cognitive decline. These are some things I've found that might lessen the chances of getting dementia. I'm really hoping that in the future more can be done about this terrible disease. I would like to say keep a journal through the years and notice any change in your handwriting. The reason I say this is because my LO use to have nice handwriting and as he declined so did his writing. Idk if that will help its a suggestion.
Exercise. Avoid sugar. Don't drink in excess. Avoid hearing loss, or if you have hearing loss, get hearing aids. Stay connected with people and have a support system and friendships. Learn new skills and activities throughout your life.
My mom did all this including eating organic, daily exercise, and not drinking or smoking. Despite this her Alzheimer’s symptoms began at 60. She is 74 today and in memory care but still recognizes me.

I would never discourage anyone from becoming healthier, but so much in life boils down to genetics and luck.

Don’t wait for tomorrow to live life to its fullest.
Not a doctor, nothing scientific here. But, it runs in my family and there appears (to me anyway) to be a correlation between how much you ""flex"" your brain and the severity and speed of the decline.  Read, do puzzles, learn new things, get a couple of hobbies, etc. STAY CURIOUS and expose yourself to the unfamiliar as often as possible. The two relatives who mostly watched tv, with very little reading and no activities that weren't people-driven (e.g., socializing, coffee meetups, etc.), seemed to suffer the worst. The three who were avid readers and a bit more adventurous in their every day lives (travel (even if it was just stuff in the state), outings to experience museums, lectures, etc.) seemed to fair better. YMMV.
all the healthy stuff... limit sugar intake and exercise to keep inflammation down, learn new things and keep active- learning languages and being around little kids for some portion of your week seem to be really good for these.  And I just saw a study on how getting adequate good sleep lets your brain flush away the excess of proteins that would otherwise get tangled in there to kick off dementia.
Fish n veggies
""What's good for the heart is good for the head"" works as a general rule. Certainly would apply to risk of vascular dementia.

But there's so many different dementias, with different underlying causes that are not understood yet that it seems pretty much just luck who gets or avoids it.

Alcohol plays a bigger part in dementia than most people realise, and lots of research these days implicates pollution/air quality as a major cause.
Dementia has a lower probability of being hereditary than ppl think. I think there are markers that can be looked at in genetic studies but I think it's only for a few types.

But all the responses are correct- exercise, diet, social, stimulation. 

I try to reject all pharmaceuticals that I can also (it's just an non proven observation I had w my mom, she is on SO many pills from diabetes to blood pressure to mental health). Her new neurologist said that immediately and they are working to streamline.
Any promising medications on the horizon?
With the exception of early on-set Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's is not genetic. And even that only accounts for 3-5% of cases. Those posting about lifestyle modifications have got it right! Eat antioxidant rich foods (think bright coloured fruits and veggies), stay active, challenge your brain (try something new and interesting!) stay social (even if it's online forums for those shy/introverted types) it's about connection and conversation. Get your routine check-ups to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar etc (which if not in healthy ranging can put you at risk for vascular dementia). And try not to worry...do something to decompress and relieve your anxiety.
Didn't read the other comments but someone with expertise in the field suggested a connection with gum pockets (oral and specifically gum health) and dementia on a previous post. So oral health care?
In addition to what others haver suggested, there’s some evidence in support of intermittent fasting and (separately) the supplementation of ketone bodies to ones diet to limit the rate of decline, but so far there is only support for this in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (like the precursor to dementia) and in dementia. 
I.e. no evidence for delaying the onset of dementia. 

And I deliberately write ‚delaying the onset‘ because, as several people have pointed out, we are held to account by many things which we have no control over such as genetics and stressful life events that hasten the onset of this awful disease
Absolutely.  Step 1, by a zillion miles, is regularly exercising your mind and body.  Walk, run, ride a bike, read a book, cook from new recipes, crossword puzzles, sudoku...  literally anything that stimulates your mind and body.  Then get your nutrition right.  Particularly in the case of EOAD, there's some strong connections between it and heart disease and poor dental health.  My Mom was just dx with EOAD in 2019 (she has both heart disease and lifelong poor dental health), and her dad had it too.  The thought of it striking me or one of my brothers haunts me daily.  Like, every time my mind doesn't fire on all cylinders I think about it -- and I'm only 37.  

Know this though, if it's going to happen, there is nothing available to stop it.  These things, and some medications, can slow down its progression, but Alzheimers and dementia is a steam train heading downhill -- there's nothing you can do to stop it.
Exercise and mental games! Anything that encourages memory recall or critical thinking will help keep those connections strong.
My Mom has alcohol-related dementia and she seems pretty normal unless you drill down on what she is saying and you realise it is nonsense. She will tell you what you want to hear. Gaslighting. The best thing we ever did was have her cognitive skills tested by a doctor, so the doctor took away her drivers license, so no more trips to the liquor store, then we put her in assisted living, which she agreed to, and the daily care and company has helped her memory from getting worse. If you feel like your memory is going, find a happy assisted living place with memory care. Then you can transition to memory care when you need to. The company of residents and nurses will keep your mind active and stave off dementia.
I think genetics have a major influence.  We can mitigate but the odds have to be in favour of genetics ? My mum or gran never drank, smoked , stressed and my granny although particularly intelligent ended up speaking to a potted plant in her dotage. My mum is going same way at similar age. Her family are all suffers.  I'm mid 40s and drink, stress, have poor diet and expect I'll be diagnosed with dementia and alzheimers. I've my missus warned I don't want to be a burden and the kids are told not to ever worry about me and to live their lives.
Genetic testing may be available to you at some time in the future, and more is being learned about the markers for different types of dementia all the time. Keep tabs on the research and an eye out for studies that relate to staving off dementia.

I would be cautious about general searches on the topic via typical search engines. Their algorithms are designed to sell dubious products.
Do not take Benadryl unless absolutely necessary. Look up anticholinergics and minimize the amount you take. Many sleep medications, first generation antidepressants, etc are on the list.
Eat healthy, exercise and don't drink.
Not specifically related to Alzheimer’s, but… If you have or think you have had a neuro event of any type (TIA, mini-stroke, flashes in your vision, weird stuff like that) go see a doctor about it.  My mom had a series of ‘spells’ that she refused treatment for because she didn’t want to be a bother.  The result is a five-year decline into vascular dementia.  Prolly could have been completed avoided had she gotten treatment, according to her neurologist
Genetics has an impact mostly in only rare dementia disease.  
The is a correlation between dementia and depression. Researches found that ""people who became depressed late in life had a 70% increased risk of dementia, and those who'd been depressed since middle age were at 80% greater risk"".

Dementia,Pot Calls the Kettle Black,"I was walking down the hall with my deaf, nuts, mostly miserable mom at her assisted living facility and another resident came around the corner walking towards us. My mom said ""oh, here comes this old fart"".","Heh.  My mom is constantly complaining that everyone there is so OLD.  Yeah, mom and some of those people older than you don't have dementia so they seem a lot younger than you.

She also complains that people dress like hobos.  She wears my dad's pants (dad died 25 years ago) with tevas/socks.  Look in the mirror, ma, you're no fashion plate yourself.  

Oddly, she also talks down women who dress well.  I think they make her feel self-conscious, so they get cast as rich snobs.

Of course, mom makes these comments loudly so if the people she's talking about aren't completely deaf they know she's talking about them. 

And she complains it's hard to make friends.
Lol. My grandpa on his first day told me ""I'm not supposed to be here with all these old people!""
My MIL calls us to complain that ""Everyone here is old and has something wrong with their brains.""
FIL totally has issues with his fellow residents for the same reasons that he pisses them off. It's pretty funny sometimes.
My dad said recently, “I can’t believe Biden is my age he acts so much older.” Then my dad struggles with walking and forgetting what day it is. 🤨
One time my grandmother called my mom in the middle of the night to ask for help because “this old man” (my grandfather, her husband of 61 years) was sleeping next to her. Thankfully, he is pretty deaf and had no idea.
My mom also complains that everyone at her  facility is old. Then again, she argued with me that is was her 67th birthday a couple of weeks ago. I just went with it. It's nice being in my late 20's again.
Omg hahaha I just had real tears from laughing this is awesome!
My Mum is 81 and her brother is 85, they always refer to “elderly” people. Makes me wonder what their context is!
My mom insists she is ""the sharpest knife in the drawer"" at her assisted living center. Oh mom.
Oh, these poor old souls!

You guys sharing the comedy and exasperation of dealing with our dementia families, but also the comedy comes through.
My mom says everyone at her facility is crazy and all she has is memory problems sometimes lol
So many of your family members sound exactly like my mom!! 🤣🤣 this is the first real laugh I've had today. Thank you all! 🖤

Dementia,Grandma thinks she is hungry all the time,"Hi everyone. Due to advanced dementia, my grandma needs 24/7 care which includes controlling when and what she eats. This means that we feed her at particular times every day, particular type of food (she has 0 teeth left). 

However, we have an issue: 1) she forgets whether she has eaten or not 2) I assume, her brain doesn't understand the feeling of being full anymore, and it seems like she is in a state of constant ""hunger"", even if she has just eaten a full meal 5 minutes ago. Also, she would literally eat however much food you put on her plate, and I mean it - if she had access, she would just be eating everything non-stop in ridiculous amounts. 

She is roaming around and ""spying"" on us whenever we do something in the kitchen, thinking that we don't feed her. We started locking the kitchen cupboards, fridge, and the kitchen itself, because we have found her multiple times standing there and just eating plain bread in the middle of the night, etc. 

She never tells us that she is hungry, never asks for food, and always says ""no"" if you offer her more after she finishes her plate. But we can very clearly see that she thinks she is hungry all the time and thinks that she hasn't eaten anything for who knows how long. 

This makes it very hard for us to eat in peace because of her hiding around the corner and judging. It also means that we sometimes feel guilty and overfeed her. 

If anyone has a similar problem, how do you deal with it?","So sorry you’re going through this. Do you all eat at the same time? That could help maybe and might mean you all eat together, unless she needs assistance with food. This way you can take turns maybe assisting - like one person does it one day, the other the next. 

She might be bored or lonely, so maybe encouraging having something to do might be good. It will get her mind off things.

Divide the portion into two and if she persists to want to have more, maybe give her the second portion after. 

Fill up the plate with salad and vegetables - couldn’t / doesn’t hurt to get in some healthy 5 a day. 

She might be mistaking thirst for hunger. Might also offer low calorie drinks too? 

Also, leaving healthy snacks about, like fruit maybe. She can snack on those. 

Could also speak with a Doctor and dietitian or a local dementia support service as they can give specialised advise too :)
Talk to her Dr. I have seen a few different conditions...mostly brain/neurological (and dementia could cause this)...where the function of switching hunger off/on stops working.

I took care of a young guy with mental/developmental disabilities that he had no switch to turn hunger off. His family had to keep the fridge and cupboards locked like you do. If things were not locked up, he would even try to eat frozen foods and raw meat. For his condition, sadly, there was nothing more they could do than to keep things locked up and to give me meals/snacks at regular times.

Depending on what is causing it, there could be potential for medication and/or behavioral therapy remedies. But you will not know until a Dr rules out potential underlying causes. It's a possibility if she is moving around/walking/pacing a lot, she could be burning more calories and thus hungrier. Or, something with her dementia (or other cause) could have triggered a higher metabolism, and her body needs the extra calories. 

Another thing I would recommend, even though you mentioned she sleeps a lot during the day...is to try to keep her awake during the day, and try to keep meals close to consistent in timing and size. If she sleeps all day and doesn't eat for 12 hours because she's been sleeping...of course she is going to be hungry and hunting for food, even if that time is in the middle of the night.

Also, as someone else mentioned...try keeping lower calorie snacks available for her to munch on. If she likes veggies, maybe have some celery, carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, etc...around for her to eat when she is hungry outside of meal times.
Would leaving the empty dishes sitting there serve as a reminder? I only offer this since you say she never asks for seconds. Maybe seeing the empty plate in front of her reminds she she just ate. If you left it there longer, that could delay her foraging.",2022-01-27 10:33:50,AmazingAmiria,se12md
Dementia,I am struggling. I'm taking care of my 93yr old g-ma.,"My grandma is awesome. A+ person, A+ grandma but she does laps around the house all day checking on me, checking on this, checking on that. I've gotten coloring books, but see can't see so well, I got big bold type playing cards but she forgets what we're doing after each hand. I know she's just bored but I'm running out of ideas. The same questions over and over I can deal with I raised 5 kids so I'm as patient as they come. I just want to help. And I want her happy and content. Any ideas are welcome and would be a great help.




Edit: thank you to you ALL. You've given me great ideas and paths to follow that I would have NEVER came up with on my own. This truly is a great community and I appreciate you all from the bottom of my heart!","With my loved one who is like a 2yr old on steroids, is into everything and I'm constantly trying to keep him busy.             He can do small tasks to drain some of his energy like sweep the porch, walk with me to check the mail or help fold laundry. He doesn't do most of the tasks right and that's ok cause I'm just trying to keep him busy.  For some craft projects we paint on ceramic figures or string beads or play with playdough.         I find that medication helps alleviate some but not all of his energy which is tied to being confused and anxious.         Its hard when our loved ones are still full of energy/life but are mentally low functioning. Its awesome of you Op to have patience cause that quality will help you during the tough times of caregiving. Were only human and have limits. I also want to say I've had some success with getting him to play with fidget blankets and fidget cubes.                Best of luck to you and your grandma❤
My mother did jigsaw puzzles. We just adjusted the levels all the way down to 9. She sorted buttons and we played games like Dominoes and later Hi Ho Cherry-O. We also bounced a ball and danced and sang to old songs.  It’s tough keeping them busy, but it helps keep Sundowning and other behaviors at bay.
Get a big box and fill it with colorful socks. Have her match the socks. It’s easy and keeps them busy for awhile.
My Dad did laps as well.  Non stop walking never sat still.  My mom put tables around his path and had games on each table.  Puzzles , letters , numbers etc as my dad would walk he would put one puzzle piece in place then keep walking. My mom would get children's games from good will and switch them out to keep it interesting.    It was a great idea and worked well for my Dad since he wouldn't sit still.
Thank you very much
One task that helps pass time is to get a  big bowl full of change and then have her sort into smaller bowls by denomination.
Does she a favourite song or music she likes to listen to ?

I find that music has a good effect on my father in law.
The dr prescribes mine aricept and ritalin (low dose 5 mg split in half, one in morning, one half at noon). The effects have been great! It's also helped lower the anxiety along with a small zoloft. So far not an issue with blood pressure meds or anything. It's a big help to me as a caregiver, too. Notice a big difference
My Mum loves to crochet. She spends many hours a day crocheting blankets for a group we volunteer with doing street service for our houseless neighbors and newborns through Project Linus. She really looks forward to a visit to the wool store to choose her colors, textures, etc and it keeps her busy.
My mum loves music and old photos. She loves singing and talking about days gone bye. She also enjoys having her hair and nails done. Not to mention trips in the car and faces she's not seen in a while. Young children and animals cheer her up. Everyone is different, but I thought I'd share some of the things that work for me. Best of luck.
My 95yr old MIL lives with us.  She has moderate dementia.  She loves scissors.  She cuts recipes and newspaper articles and the like.  I'll give her the grocery flyers and she'll cut out anything she needs.  If your Gram likes that kind of thing she could cut out foods she likes, pictures from old magazines, maybe make a collage.

You could also look up some exercise videos on youtube for older people.  Get her sweating to the oldies!",2022-01-27 08:27:34,donthepunk,sdydur
Dementia,Mom with dementia: Advice or tips for upcoming move?,"My mom (mid-stage dementia) will be moving to an independent living facility next month and I'm looking for any advice or tips I can get. 

She has accumulated *a lot* of stuff over the past number of years as the disease has crept its way in, and there's so much to consider taking/giving/selling/junking. Not only furniture/belongings, but just junk in general. She loves her stuff. She's very trusting of me and I hope this all goes ok, but I have to be very strategic about this. There is not a lot of time and a lot to do. Plus, her new apartment would never fit even half of what's here. 

What have others' experiences been like when moving their family member with cognitive decline? Is there anything helpful you discovered in the process that you'd like to share? 

Thanks in advance.","Ah, good luck. This is so tricky.

First place to start is with the space allotment or floor plan for the facility she's moving into. How much space will she have, and how much furniture can she bring? Realistically it's going to be a very small amount, to allow room (if needed eventually) for walkers, wheelchairs, etc. 

From there, really push her to identify her favorites. Admittedly these might change day to day, so you may have to really try to figure out which pieces will be the most meaningful for her. And use your best judgement. Favorite chair she always sits in? Send it with her. Uncomfortable formal chairs that go with a dining room set? Nope. 

Take pictures of things that have good memories and save those for her. You can put those in a Google or Shutterfly photo album book that she can look through and talk through with you. Heirlooms that have lots of sentimental value but zero actual value are also good things to take pictures of and remember that way. 

As for the physical de-junking: it takes time. Start now with the things she doesn't care about. We've found this is mostly extra clothes, stuff from when my siblings and I were much younger (though this we tell her we're taking these things to our own homes, just to make her feel better), weird kitchen appliances, etc. 

If you won't need to put her place on the market immediately after she moves, you can get rid of everything else then.  [This book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0052ZR5QA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is great; it's a nice summary of what to focus on and who to give it to. Realistically, you and your siblings (or whomever else is named in her will; make sure you know this) will want to go through everything together. It will be very hard. Keep reminding yourselves that it would be harder to do this after she's gone, and you're helping her and yourselves by doing it now. Plus you may find something she needs. 

And if you don't have time later... start now with everything she won't need, and be willing to cut corners. We made a spreadsheet once that estimated it would take something like 4 years, working an hour a day and more on weekends, to properly go through everything in my MILs small house, assuming every damn thing was looked at, considered, and then sold or gifted properly. But if you take donate everything to your favorite local places, or put it all out front on a nice day for a ""free, everything must go!"" type of yard sale... you can be done a lot more quickly. 

Good luck. Dealing with similar situations with parents and inlaws now and it's really hard. All the best as you go through this!
I’m moving mom
First  and THEN getting rid  of all her stuff
Ask her to pick out several items that she wants to have in her new apartment.  My late mom specified certain chairs, her sofa, favorite artwork and framed photos.  I actually spent the first night with her (with the assisted living approval, and I slept on the sofa) so  she wouldn’t be too freaked out.
My Dad is a hoarder. So I have a bit of experience with this.

I would say the first BIG step would be to decide what, of all her stuff she collected, is the most important/precious to her...and would be something reasonable to take with her to the nursing facility. Now, if she hoarded real cats and that was the most important to her, it still would not be reasonable for her to take to the nursing facility with her.

For my Dad, his most important was his huge stamp and coin collection. ALL of his stamps and coins have come to my place, and are currently taking up a sizeable area in my basement until we can get them all organized and cataloged. Next up, was his books. He had enough books to have his own library. Unfortunately, we do not have enough room to bring them ALL here (he was moving in with me, and I live in a town house). So, I went through them all...keeping what seemed to be the more important, most relevant to his interests, were more entertaining, etc. After that, it was a sorting through everything else to see what could be useful and/or reasonable to keep. I kept his sentimental things like pictures, important papers, etc. Then, I kept him a few knickknacks and holiday decorations.

Everything else was either given away (to someone who could use them), donated, recycled, or trashed. I only really trashed stuff if it was not in a good condition (like a lot of the stuff kept in the basement of the home), or was something that could not really be donated, after seeing if anyone wanted/needed it first.

It was rough on him. As a hoarder, he had an attachment to all that stuff, even if we could not understand why. And with his memory, he sometimes forgets we had to get rid of a lot, and will ask about the stuff.

If your loved one is with it enough, try to get them to help with the sorting and decisions on what stays/goes (within reason). If not, try to make the best judgement you can, based on what you think your loved one would want.
I also had to move my mid-stage dementia mom to independent living. She had lived in the same place for decades, and her new apartment was much smaller, so we had to discard a LOT of stuff. I was moving her out of state, so we couldn't do the move gradually.

First thing we learned was NOT to try to do any sorting or decision-making in the evening. She would sundown and get belligerent.

My mom had accumulated way too much stuff, so there was a lot of negotiating what to keep. For example, she had 11 white skirts, so I asked her to pick out her 2 favorite ones. The process of giving her options worked well. 

We were fortunate that there was a local charity that was willing to pick up anything we wanted to donate. We just put everything on the front patio and they came and got it. Furniture, housewares, clothing, etc. (Funny story -- one of the neighbors kept going through the stuff and took some of it, which was fine with us.)

Be careful about getting rid of things like books -- I flipped through the pages of books to make sure there weren't any photos or money in them. And I didn't get rid of ANYTHING without making sure there wasn't anything meaningful or valuable in them. Turned out that my mom had been hiding her jewelry in a kleenex box under the bathroom sink. She had pulled out a wad of kleenex, stashed the jewelry in the box, and then put the wad of kleenex back on top of it.

I also checked every pocket of every piece of clothing we were donating. We found nothing of value, but there was kleenex in every single pocket.

Things like her small file cabinet with her important papers ended up at my house. As her dementia progressed, she lost the ability to know which papers were important. We did learn later than she had already thrown away important papers that should have been kept.

Another poster has very good advice about getting a floor plan so you can anticipate what furniture will fit. This worked well for us.

And as I'm sure you know, don't get rid of photos, artwork, keepsakes, heirlooms. At some point, you might need to take away some of those items from your mom, for safekeeping. 

One of my biggest regrets was not taking a HUGE box of old family photos from my mom when she was in the earlier stages of dementia. I never in a million years thought she would do anything with that box. (Even when I was kid, I loved going through those old photos.) But once when I was visiting her (I lived hundreds of miles away from her), I looked for the box and couldn't find it. I asked her about it, and she told me she had thrown in away. I was stunned. I ask her why, and she said, ""I couldn't remember who those people were."" These photos went back to the 1800s. I still feel sick when I think about it. All of my ancestors' photos were gone. There were hundreds of photos. I still kick myself for not taking that box away from her.

Anyway, keep an eye on the unreplaceable items. Keep them at your house if necessary. We didn't really have to worry about things like jewelry. When we were getting ready to move my mom, she took out her jewelry and told us to pick out what we wanted. I think at that point, she didn't want to be responsible for it. But much of her jewelry, including the pieces I would have loved to have, were already gone. She didn't even remember them. And I discovered that she had given away a silver ring I had made for her many years ago when I took a silversmithing class. <sigh>

But I still do have some heirlooms safe in my basement, including ancient framed photos of my mom when she was a baby. And I retrieved some ancient 8mm family movies, some from the '40s. (I had them digitized.)

So basically, it's the unreplaceable items that were the most important to me. Household stuff could easily be replaced.
I did this with both mom and dad (separately) and my best advice is to go through each room and set aside things they want to take (I made a staging area in the front room). I packed and moved all that stuff and hired an estate company to do the rest. Both of my parents were hoarder borderline and though I know we left important/valuable stuff behind, I’d still be digging through their stuff now five years later.

Hire an estate co and make peace with missing stuff. It’s the sanity saving option.
This is brutal for you. I did this with my MIL in early stage dementia, I spent a few days with her and saw what she used on a day to day basis (packed all that was reasonable). We’d have casual conversations about furniture, mostly me complimenting something and then reading her reaction, and I made a list of things she loved. We packed up all her clothes, half her linens, too many trinkets, any pictures she wanted. 

She moved out to retirement living and left everything else (complete hoarder). My partner and I moved in to her home (when I was 9 months pregnant) and have just now, 2 years later gotten rid of all her things. It is so much work. She doesn’t ask about anything, and if she does (mid stage dementia now), she forgets before we’d be able to bring it over. 

There are services that will go through your loved ones things, sort it and garbage the actual garbage for you if that’s an option. I had my mum come and help, put a lot on marketplace for free, donated so much stuff.
Can you keep renting her old place for a few months? bring the essentials, furniture, the most necessary and sentimental items. Then sort through it yourself after she is moved in. At least get rid of the actual trash, and things she won’t remember at all. And pull out whatever is useful or very special along the way. Pare it down, sort by category, label the boxes. Then the rest can go into a storage facility when she cannot afford rent on the old place. r/declutter r/childofhoarder r/hoarding r/ufyh
Wow. I went through this a year ago and this could have been my post. I wish I would have been more hands on, but even now I do not know how I could’ve been.

I hired a company to help my mother downsize and get ready. (Also early/mild and into independent living.) I was really relying on this company’s purported expertise in this area to help her and me both get ready for this. Unfortunately, they stunk. I wish I had recognized this at the time but even now I have to just completely accept that it just was how it was.

The process of moving her and then getting rid of her things (multigenerational treasure trove of stuff accumulated in her wonderful house), the anxiety and stress around getting it ready for sale was difficult to say the least. I was able to involve multiple family members at the end who really did so much work and to whom I am forever indebted.

Of course, of all the things that she had in her new place, none of them were the things that she wanted. We moved her in before we cleaned out the house so that allowed her to go back on hunt and find adventures. Of course, they were very low yield as she wandered around the house moving things back-and-forth and rarely getting them into her box to take back. Of course she wanted to keep everything, and that meant putting (some of) it in storage.

After the house was cleaned out and sold she still would want a specific item, from a certain place in her old house, but of course it was no longer there. Some of the things I could recall were put in storage and others donated and other things I just do not know. 

Unfortunately, when she moved in all of the Covid lockdowns were still in place. This did not affect the independent living residents, but it affected me as I could not stay there with her or help her explore the community. There were other residents who were assigned to help all new residents as well as staff members but because of her cognitive difficulties it was so very very difficult. I think it was the fear that she felt but tried to hide but that I could tell was there that made it so difficult for me.

Learning the ins and outs of the new complex was very difficult. Even just getting to the trash room was a full day affair. Nothing was acceptable or as nice as her old house. This is true but the community of people around her really has made a difference. She definitely can get around now but I think still doesn’t make full use of all their offerings.

I wonder all the time if I’ve done the right thing. Intellectually I can justify it. But it has been so difficult and such a change for her. While I know it is not really what she “wants” she is also very willing to work with me in the situation even though she is very much not happy about it. I am extraordinary fortunate in that way.

I did not realize this would get so long. I hope it is understandable (voice to text). I wish you luck. I wish that I had more tangible advice. It sounds like you are doing the right thing.
I'm a big fan of Dana K White's approach. She has great advice about how to help someone declutter without asking questions like 'is this useful' or 'is this valuable' because for a cluttery person the answer to those is always yes.

[https://www.aslobcomesclean.com/2019/09/219-helping-someone-downsize-the-beginning-of-the-slow-process-podcast/](https://www.aslobcomesclean.com/2019/09/219-helping-someone-downsize-the-beginning-of-the-slow-process-podcast/)

She gets into these 'rules' in the podcast but a good place to start is trash. So you go through the whole space with a black trash bag and just pick out obvious garbage. Black is good because they can't see what it is and question your choice. It's a good place to start because it's not emotional or loaded items and it helps you make clear progress right off the hop. Then have them pick out their favourite things with consideration of the size of where you are moving to. Getting through the remainder that won't fit is the toughest part. 

One thing I've learned is that they fatigue quickly due to all the decision making. But if you can involve them at the beginning and they see you respecting their choices and not questioning why they value what they value, the trust increases and then they will leave you to continue to sort while they rest. I did this with family members. Once I had a sense of what they valued from our work together I continued to work while they rested, and that's when I made some calls on my own without asking for permission. Due to their cognitive impairment you may have to make some of those calls for them. Another key is to have donatable 'to donate' boxes ready to go, and get them out the door to the donation centre or in your car that day before there is any second guessing.
Try to set up the apartment to look as much like her current living situation. For example my mom had a specific painting over her couch, TV in a specific corner, etc, so I tried to set thing up in similar locations. Same with the kitchen cupboards. It’s hard to get it exactly the same but if it’s close I think that helps. When I set up her kitchen I left every cupboard door and drawer open. I told her it was to help her learn where her things were at, & to keep things open as long as it took to get used to it.

If she has any specific hobbies make sure those items are set up and ready to go. My mom does jigsaw puzzles and likes to paint, so I had a puzzle table and her easel ready to go. She loves to read and always had tons of books, so I made sure she had a filled book case as well as little baskets of books placed around the apartment just like she had in her house. 

If there are any small electronics that require batteries, have fresh batteries put in them because I can guarantee you within two or three days of her moving in, the batteries are going to die!

Despite your best efforts, expect her to be looking for some random small item, probably one you may not even remember her ever owning.

My mom moved in right at the beginning of the pandemic, so I couldn’t see her in her apartment nor take her out for quite a while. In some ways that may have helped her transition a little more quickly.",2022-01-27 05:59:12,Meligonia,sdvtqu
Dementia,Any medication tricks other than pudding?,"My mom is getting progressively more and more resistant to taking medication, especially in the evenings.

We've moved what pills we can to other points in the day, but she absolutely HAS to take two trazodone pills just before bed, or she'll be a complete wreck the next day.

The issues:

Trazodone is incredibly, incredibly bitter. They're ""coated,"" but it's a very thin coating that does nothing to keep the bitter taste sealed. AFAIK that's the only way it is available. We've been coating them in two additional coats of cake glaze (we tried a pill coat thing, but it was expensive and not great, and most pill-swallowing aids coat the mouth, not the pill, and if you think you're opening my mom's mouth and spraying stuff inside without all hell breaking loose, well...). That mostly works, except....

She's started holding the pills in her mouth while swallowing her water. Yeah that's right, she'll take the pill, drink the water, swallow, sit for a minute, and then spit out the pills. She's worse than my cats! 

Due to her holding them in her mouth, the cake glaze dissolves and they're super bitter again; even though we'll give her new ones, she's more and more reluctant (understandably).

She doesn't reliably eat dessert, so pudding is already iffy, and then the trazodone are so bitter that you really need excessive amounts of pudding to fully cover the taste. 

She has to take them right before bed, because they knock her out quick. 

I would be so grateful for ANY ideas about what to do.","My husband is a pharmacist and I asked him. He said there is an oral suspension that would be good for her. The vehicle for the suspension can vary from cherry syrup to Ora Sweet so bitterness wouldn't be an issue. 

He says you'd just need a doctor to write for a compounded suspension. There are many compounding pharmacies that can make this for you.
We mixed the medicine in a small amount of raspberry or strawberry jam. Then we used that jam on ice cream or even a 1/2 sandwich.
Google has told me that it can be made as a liquid medication. Maybe her doctor can have it re-written as an oral suspension, it might be easier to hide or get her to take.
There is a very bitter liquid dewormer that I had to give some of my foster dogs. We always mixed it with regular (not greek) vanilla yoghurt  because the vanilla & sweetness counteracted the bitterness. It should still work with powder. Not sure if that would be different enough from pudding though. You could top it with jam, jelly, fruit, granola or cereal.
Perhaps consult your pharmacist about whether or not they can be crushed. The majority of our residents take them well when crushed in jam or sweet pudding (chocolate boost pudding is my go to). I usually add just enough to ensure one small bite off the spoon is necessary then I quickly follow it up with a sip of a beverage that is pleasant to them. For the most part ramping up the sweet component seems to over throw the bitter when it comes to administering meds to people in memory care so I wouldn't worry too much about it being even less appealing to her in crushed form.
O hey, I saw a swallow helper thing in cvs one night (before pandemic). Comes in two flavors. I thought I should look into that but never did. Maybe it could help you? It might be like some version of the product Thickit (?sp) that's premixed and flavored to help ""the medicine go down"". Best of luck. Laughed at how she hides the pills. They can get pretty sneaky lol
Try putting it in a small drink of something? Crush it and mix it in if it can be crushed!
Try putting it in a small to medium glass of V8  
Spray whip cream
Try lemonade, the tart sour taste kid good for disguising medication
The one thing I haven't seen suggested yet is rice Krispy treats. Push them into the side of the treat, then pinch closed the hole. But if they're still with it enough you have to give treats several times a day so they don't know which one to avoid.

Big giant hugs to you. Hang in there.
This might be more useful for later stages. I crushed my dad's pills into a fine powder, mixed them with water, sucked them up with a needle-less syringe, and then squirted it into his mouth. This was when he was no longer able to eat or even really drink from a cup. I gave him plain water that way, too.

If you crush up pills, be sure to verify with the doctor. Some are time release and can actually deliver a lethal dose if crushed up.
We are having the same issues with all of my moms. She was holding them in her cheek sometimes for hours, or she would chew them. My dad has asked her physician and pharmacist and they both say her pills do not come in any other form. He asked about crushing them so we hide them in stuff and was told not to do that either. Its a battle 4 times a day getting her to take her pills.
You might also give a sweet candy the same size as the med you used to give when you start the new protocol.  The brain will still associate the familiar action as the med she is trying to control/reject, but if it is sweet, it might make it less resistant.  This might help in the future if you have a med that can't be crushed if you can extinguish the mouth holding, and if she doesn't detect the ""reward"" of figuring out the ""trick"" she might stop doing it.

(We dealt with paranoia,  so she was always suspicious she was being poisoned)
Apple sauce with a lot of cinnamon?
Been using apple sauce, works well most of the time.
Applesauce works great if they like it. I've been using ice cream, or baby cereal.
Can you put them into one larger empty pill capsule and then hide that in a sweet treat? 

I order 500 XPRS Nutra empty capsules online and shove like 4 different smaller pills into that one empty one. They come in all sizes. 

I’m thinking the extra capsule along with being hidden in a desert will form a bigger barrier against the bitterness of trazodone pills.
Like others have said, applesauce, yogurt, ice cream, sorbet. I'd follow the spoon of meds IMMEDIATELY with a drink of OJ or lemonade. Also I would think crushing them might make the bitterness more pronounced?
I don’t know if it would work with trazadone, but some meds can be compounded into a transdermal cream than can be rubbed into skin. I work at a nursing home and the nurse would give one resident “arm massages” to calm her and administer meds at the same time. I have my cat’s daily med compounded this way and I rub it into his ear. So much easier than trying to get him to take a pill!!
Try giving her soda with it. Especially if she only gets soda around pill time she’ll probably want to chug it and the pill will go right down.",2022-01-26 18:30:22,FeuerroteZora,sdjpac

My brother was driving my Walgreens one day and saw my dad's car(before we moved in and took his keys). He walked around the store looking for him, until he got to the pharmacy.

Dementia,Advice for my grandma,My Grandad passed away over the weekend. He owned a large ranch with multiple sheep dogs. My Grandmother has dementia and is taking one of the dogs with her as we help move her to a new apartment closer to our family. She has problems remembering conversations more than several minutes apart and if I take the dog out for a walk she gets very distressed in the meantime. How can I leave her some form of reminder or help her know that her dog hasn’t run away so she’s at ease while I’m out with it?,"Make and replay (her) dog videos for her to enjoy watching while you're out, perhaps add a note to the TV that the dog's out being walked and will be back shortly or better yet, a specific time with a clock on display nearby.
You could put a note on the door with your phone number if that's possible. One thing, when I was caregiving for my Dad, I would not leave my dog with him because he could just as easily let the dog out and forget - and the yard is not fenced. I'm not sure if your Grandma and her dog are planning to be the only ones, but I would think about this if that's the case.
Hmm, perhaps give her something to hold onto when you take the dog for a walk?  Perhaps it’ll give her something to do and help occupy her mind.
Could she go on the walk with you?
I leave notes all over for my Mum, even though she lives with us. It seems to help because she tends to look at everything in her environment and they reassure her.
Call her when you head out and talk to her while you walk the dog. Let her know where you are, what you see, what the dog is doing.",2022-01-25 18:04:44,WaaaaghsRUs,scqj6y
Dementia,Question about Stage 6 Dementia.,"My mom (vascular dementia)was assessed at this level. I have read all that I can but wanted to hear more personal experiences and insights. I don’t know what to expect, how long it will be at this level, and how to get my head wrapped around it all. She currently lives with me and I’m starting with a caregiver next week to help a few times a week.","I am my great uncles caregiver and like your mom he to was diagnosed with vascular dementia.I'm not sure what stage he's at but from researching his recent symptoms of sundowning, incontinence, loss of verbal skills cause he hasn't said a sentence that makes sense to me in months plus he's forgetting his surroundings more.            All this makes me believe he's in stage 5 or 6.                                                                  My worst experience thus far happened back in December when he woke up and didn't know who I was and got combative to the point where I had to wait outside til his daughter came to help. He didn't know who she was but he calmed down for her. He's on multiple medications now to help alleviate his anxiety and combativeness.                       I feel for you and your mom while y'all both endeavor this awful disease. You have all my sympathy.                                   Also I want to say hiring a caregiver is an excellent idea it might not save you any money but it sure will save something more precious, your sanity!
My mum was diagnosed with vascular dementia in around 2015 I think. It presented rather mild to begin with. Struggling to find the right words, slightly forgetful with minor things. It slowly got to the point where I would have to come over her house every day to help with little things. Had to move her closer to my house because of this, she was still able to live somewhat independently as long as I was always on call to help with stuff. But now we are at a point where everything is confusing for her. Most of what she says is nonsensical bunch of words. She’s always depressed, constantly in need of help, to put it mildly. Will need to eventually have her moved to assisted living/nursing home situation because I’ve reached my limit of what I can do, even with daily visits. It doesn’t get better, it’s pretty much a nightmare but one day at a time.
Unfortunately no one can tell how quickly things will go. Vascular dementia is known for stair-stepping downward i.e. going down in sudden big chunks as opposed to gradually, likely because vascular dementia is a lot like having a bunch of strokes. It really depends on how quick the next stair step comes. Most likely less than a year, though, and it could be shorter than that. You should start making concrete plans now to make their last days as easy as possible on all of you.",2022-01-25 15:40:30,Famoggy,scncx4
Dementia,Rapid progression of Dementia?,"My mom(54 years) is diagnosed with Lewy Bodies Dementia by multiple reputed neurologist in my country(India).

What surprising is how rapidly her case deteriorated. Within a couple of weeks she went from “normal” to severe dementia. She is severly lethargic, doesn’t recognize me or my sister(still recognizes my dad most of the times who lives with her, my sister and I are in US), has trouble speaking clearly, confused, has hallucinations and insomnia(occasionally). She was functioning and working before the symptoms started suddenly. While symptoms align well with LBD, the rapid progression at a young age is quite surprising. Some days she is quite normal(good enough memory and motor functions). She also improves when she is taken to a different nature surrounded location(they currently live in a small apartment in the city which is quite polluted).

Reading through other cases, it looks like the condition(LBD) develops over a few months if not years. 2 weeks is a really small time for full blown deterioration. I personally suspect this could be due to long covid as she had a very high readings in the antibody testing after the symptoms started. She is double vaxxed though, so can’t be certain about the cause of high anti body count.

We are planning to take her to a couple more neurologist for reevaluations. Is there anything we could do to rule out other causes of the symptoms we are seeing? Her blood work for toxins and vitamins/minerals came back normal. Lumbar puncture and MRI was also normal.","I'm very sorry you and your mom are going through this. If it hasn't already been checked then may I suggest having her doctor do a urinalysis to check for a uti. Its surprising how a uti can cause dementia symptoms to worsen.
After my Dad was diagnosed, he quit trying to pretend to be okay. He went downhill very quickly. FTD dementia like this can show up and be undiagnosed for a couple of years, you can look back and see some of the signs. I’m sorry you are going through this.
Def check for the UTI mentioned in the other comments. Also consider changes in environment and surroundings can cause dips in cognition.
Was she under a high amount of stress? I feel like stress greatly accelerated my moms LBD.
Talk to your dad about making sure she stays hydrated. Like very very hydrated. You would be shocked how huge a difference dehydration can make in dementia symptoms. 

If she has trouble swallowing or just doesn’t like water; it’ll be easier to keep her hydrated by mixing equal parts water and Gatorade.
My dads LBD progressed really quickly after the vaccine. I always wonder, seeing as how there are studies showing a correlation. I’m sorry
Hey! I am researching the experiences of caregivers for people with Dementia in India. I am having a hard time finding participants for my study. The silent suffering of the caregiver is compounded by the ""log kya kahenge"" syndrom prevalent in India. Would it be be possible to have a conversation with you regarding this?

Sadly this is so common to our dementia loved ones. They know something is wrong, and they are trying to process it and express their perception and need for help as best they can. They must be so terrified.
This may sound silly, but does she have a teddy bear she can hold?  Sometimes, its simple things like a teddy bear/ or plush kitty cat/ whatever her favorite animal is to give some comfort that can help the most.

Dementia,These last 3 days have been HELL.,"These last 3 days have been pushing me, my mom and my husband to the max...
It all started when we had dinner on saturday night in our living room we were trying to have a movie night...my dad fell...pulling down the big screen tv, my laptop and my cellphone. This putt us all into a state...i lost my cool, my mom lost her cool. I am ashamed to say that i got mad that our things could of been broken...we are poor we cannot simply go out and replace a broken tv or get a new cellphone or laptop.( the tv was gift from my husbands family, the laptop is years old but i use it for studying and my cellphone is old aswell..I am from South Africa here not all people can just replace things if they break) I freaked out as I start my 4th year of Uni and with out a laptop i cannot study at all. I am glad my dad is ok just have a few bruises but we were all shook up. Mom was so angry I have never seen her so angry at my dad. She blames him and HE NEVER ASKS FOR HELP and if he did all this drama could of been avoided. 
My dad fell 2 more times...all because he refuses to ask for help. Since the falls he just looked out of it, my mom also fell and hurt her back so things are not happy in this house. I just wish my dad would ask for help and he refuses to tell my mom if he has any issues or pain and we are REALLY GETTING SICK OF IT.","Does your Dad have dementia?  If so, you can't expect him to know when he needs help, or to remember to ask for help when doing certain things, or to know when he might be doing something dangerous. You need to adjust your lives and your home to living with someone with dementia and someone that has a high fall risk.  Falls cannot be completely prevented but family/caregivers should keep an eye out for when he might need help and provide it without waiting for him to ask. If you are in another room, there are floor or chair alarms that can alert you when he stands up. Bolting the TV to the wall is an option as is having him use a walker (you will need to constantly put it in front of him and remind him to use it, etc.).
A person who has dementia can't always think ahead enough to ask for help. What you call refusal might well be inability. That is most unfortunate about your laptop; I hope you can get that sorted some way, for school.

Regarding your dad, assume the best about him: he is probably doing the best he can, and everybody else will have to adapt, because they can and he can't.",2022-01-25 10:41:18,StudentTeacher278,scgjoj
Dementia,A family friend passed last night,"I need to talk about this..

A family friend has had dementia for several years and it was pretty bad.

I wasn't very affected by it as his wife handled most things and made sure we saw him only on good days.

I've known that dementia kills. Like, it's just something you are told.

But yesterday he was out on a walk with his wife, as they do every single day,

and he just stopped existing. Mid step. No ""It hurts"" or any other words.. He just left in silence.

I'm of course grateful that it was quick. He was not weak or in need of help walking or anything.

But I just can't wrap my head around what happened - that he was just gone, mid-step, without any warning or sign of distress..

Is this a thing with dementia? Or is it more likely that it's a blood clot or something?","Dying this way is not at all specific to those with dementia. My grandmother, who didn't have dementia, fell over dead walking out of a room with my mother with no immediate indication anything was amiss. Could be a half dozen different things - stroke, heart attack, ruptured aneurism, etc. People just die suddenly sometimes and their cognitive state may not figure into it at all.
Sorry for your loss , this must have been really tough for your friend to deal with by herself.

It appears to have been a heart attack that your friend suffered.
It sounds like a ruptured aneurysm. I'm sorry to hear about your loss.

Dementia,I'm worried about my dad.,"His dad started losing his memory in his 70s. My dad is now 58. He does ask me to repeat things that have said already. But I don't know if that's because he just didn't listen to me the first time, or generally doesn't remember. I'm really scared. I don't know what to do and we live in Canada. I guess healthcare is okay. What are the right things I should ask him to check for at the doctors? Should I ask him to start taking b12 vitamins? Should I ask him to do a puzzle with me everyday? Please I really want him to remember me forever.","Start with an audiology assessment for hearing aids. Most seniors have some degree of hearing loss and would benefit from hearing aids to be actively participating in complex conversation. 

Also check the meds he's on and make sure he's not taking benadryl regularly https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/two-types-of-drugs-you-may-want-to-avoid-for-the-sake-of-your-brain
Have him see a neurologist. But be careful in terms of how you approach it, especially if this isn't something you've talked about before. Most people do *not* respond well to the suggestion that they may have dementia, even if we're just talking very early stages. If you think that's going to be the case, you might tell him that since his dad had problems in his 70s, it's probably a really good idea to go see a neurologist now, *heading into* ~~in~~ his 60s, so that if he starts feeling like he has problems in his 70s, he'll have a baseline to compare it against.

Alternately, if he's forgetful enough that you've already broached the topic a few times, you can point out that memory loss *can* be due to issues other than dementia, in which case it's something that can be treated and maybe reversed; focus on those possibilities, because it is *really* difficult to go see a doctor if you think they're just basically going to give you an extended death sentence.

(The baseline thing is actually why I went to a neurologist to get a thorough test at age 30 - I saw my mom constantly afraid *every* time she forgot something, and I am incredibly forgetful and also have ADHD and did not want to have to worry every time I misplaced the damn milk. So if *you* are concerned about whether this might be something you will face, consider getting evaluated yourself for that baseline. It would also probably help convince your dad that this is OK to do.)

*edited because he's 58 and not already in his 60s.*
You should get him assessed by a professional.
The Audiologist is a great first step. As u/itsonlyapapermoon said, most seniors do develop hearing issues as they age. But more than that, research shows that poor hearing can accelerate dementia. Also, over the years, I have played games with my father as a way to track his cognitive abilities — plus it has the added benefit of spending quality time with him. At this point in his progression, dominoes is a great game to monitor both his conversation during the game, and his ability to keep track of the game play. It is also an excellent way to exercise his mind.
There has been recent talk about the relation of oral health/tooth care as being a possible factor. I'm organizing papers of his and it seems the dentist was putting a few crowns in per year. Apathy, the loss of interest in things they used to love doing. Try to keep your Dad engaged in things. My Dad loved taking bird photos and making detailed emails. Then he just decided it wasn't worth it. I hadn't moved back yet (I did when I started to notice more) so it took longer to pick up on. Dad loved doing the crossword and mind puzzles. Music is always good - I think that stimulates the other half of the brain. I hate this disease so much
Ditto on the hearing aids. My dad is 88 and he has them but won't wear them, then insists that I never told him something. He is losing SOME of his cognitive functions, but most of his ""slips"" are due to not ""wearing those darned things"".",2022-01-24 00:16:30,SnooCauliflowers3903,sbe5xq
Dementia,Protein powder,"What do you guys think about mixing protein powder in with coffee creamer ? My grandmother is still in early enough stages to have a routine , but unfortunately that means her coffee and sweet treats constitute breakfast and much of the day follows along those lines. Her side of the family must not have the strong diabetes genes because she's been all about the sweets for a long time. She will eat veggies with one meal so that's good , but still not a lot of protein . She does her instant coffee in the morning and gets her creamer out of the dish with help. I thought I could put some Orgain French vanilla in half the jar and mix it to see what happens . I also could bake with it I suppose.  Has this worked for anyone ?","My mom absolutely loves those prepackaged protein and vitamin drinks, like Ensure and Boost. Try one of those, if you're able.
Not sure about the whole protein powder thing. I just let mum have her sweets and little things that make her happy. It's hard to get her to eat anything, so if it's ice cream and pudding over nothing else, that's what she has lol. Before she moved into care, we had to give her little ensure drinks. Her nutrition was dire, she was drinking and looked like a skeleton. Went to see her last night and she looks like a new woman. Still only slight, but not near death. We lost dad last year as well - she keeps saying she has no man and no house. So, I reckon too much of a sweet thing is fine as long as she's got a little bit of joy in her life. She's looked after in every other way. I like her to have some choices.
I'm not sure about mixing it in with coffee creamer, because she might notice the taste difference and toss the creamer/coffee thinking they've just gone off. It could also change the consistency and texture. I did use whey protein mixed with milk and ice cream as a bulking tactic when my dad needed to gain some weight back post surgery, and I'll toss it in fruit smoothies sometimes for a bit extra protein. I get chocolate flavored, so it's more like a treat than something 'healthy' so my dad is more likely to eat it.
I get what you're trying to achieve, but unless your grandmother drinks a lot of coffee, the uplift in her protein intake is going to be fairly minimal. You can get protein rich creamery, by the way, but baking with protein powder sounds like a better option. And maybe something you can do together?

All the best to you both.
Perhaps a high protein morning milkshake?
Seems to small to matter.    I got powder mix from a company called Huel.    My Mom would drink a litter of water in an hour when I gave her Huel mix.    She really, really loved the Chocolate flavor. 

Heul  is a meal replacement product, so you can have a liquid meal instead of sitting down.  I found it  by talking to weight lifter on how they add good calories to their diet to bulk
I've mixed protein powder into baked sweets I haven't noticed much of a taste difference. Bulletproof unflavored also mixes well into coffee and juice.
Let her enjoy her coffee and sweets
Protein is extremely helpful slowing cognitive decline. Maybe try to see if she'd like something like https://www.target.com/p/premier-protein-shake-cafe-latte-12pk-11oz/-/A-81858684. Dad has one with breakfast as part of his routine and loves it.
Not in coffee gross. Try a collagen creamer and mix the powder into a shake or something. Collagen creamer will
Be great for her brain.
So whatever they eat is what works, so its beat to be flexible. We were making her milkshakes with protein powder from bjs/costco and peanut butter powder
I would suggest Ensure or Boost. My grandmother will go through 3 or 4 ensures in a day, and we have a few different flavors so she can have some variety. But she’s the same way with sweets, if we can’t get her to eat anything else she will always take a honeybun
Check the labels! The Premier Protein and Muscle Milk drink products actually contain a lot more protein than Ensure or Boost - 30 grams - and both of them have far less sugar than Ensure or Boost products. 

Consider adding unflavored collagen peptides to her coffee if you don’t think she is getting all of the essential amino acids. My aunt also takes probiotics because one of her medications tends to make her constipated. I sometimes add a scoop or two of an unflavored, powdered egg protein to home made muffins and cakes.

We just got back from my aunt’s doctor because she doesn’t have much of an appetite right now. She’s 81, her blood sugar levels are fine and her doctor said she can have all of the cakes, scones, pastries, and ice cream she wants all day long because he is more concerned about her losing weight and getting weak than anything else. He’s also fine with her eating her favorite meal several times a week - a double cheeseburger, large fries and a strawberry shake. She takes a vitamin but I’m looking into a vitamin powder drink mix because they may be absorbed better (she has stomach issues). I know nothing about those fruits & veggie supplements but will try to research those soon. 

Best of luck with your grandma but I highly recommend the 30 gram Premier Protein drinks - they have a nice variety of flavors! And, if she’s like my aunt, she probably needs the extra protein.
Protein powder will often clump & curdle when mixed with hot liquid.  You’re better off with single serving tetrapak protein drinks
i use protein powder lots.  My husband mixes up a week's worth at a time, but we dilute it with cashew milk, add baking chocolate and stevia, and a couple other things.  Then i have some diluted half-and-half with milk, and the other WAS diluted half-and-half with water.  Now that my smells and taste are mostly gone, the protein powder has lost most of its appeal, even at nearly full strength, but i still like the ""coat the throat and tummy"" feeling.",2022-01-21 21:53:05,BionicWoahMan,s9samr
Dementia,"Mom has Early Onset, worried about the future.","My grandmother was diagnosed with dementia around the time I was born, I am not sure how old she was, I think Early to mid sixties, and remember being worried about my mom getting it when I was a kid. Me and my mom were very close and she was the only person I could talk to during some hard times. When I was in middle school she started showing signs and was diagnosed after a car accident with Early Onset Alzheimer's.

For context she was 38 when I was born so she was diagnosed around 53. I think for a while I was just so devastated by it that I wasn't able to process it, this was something that I had a extreme fear of as a child. It's been a little over four years since then and i'm 19 now. She's getting toward the later stages it seems and I care for her often but it gets more painful. Every time pick her up and help her in my car or try and get her to focus on chewing her food I feel like i'm closer to getting Alzheimer's myself. Since I think my grandmother was diagnosed with a different form of dementia than my mom I am not sure it's familial, but there's no denying that they both got the disease at a relatively young age. I'm terrified that I could develop it at an even younger age then them and that ill spend my 30's or 40's like them. Some of this may sound callused and I know it is somewhat selfish to think about me when they are both still going through this but this is killing me on the inside. From what I've read familial Alzheimer's  is very rare but my families situation seems like it could be a case of it.

I would like to hear some of your stories and if anybody can give some advice I'd appreciate it, many people I've talked to dont understand how hard taking care of someone with Alzheimer's is. It's not like when somebody dies and you can grieve and move on, this has been going on for years and I have no closure, I don't know what to do.","I work with a group that specializes in familial Alzheimer’s disease. Feel free to PM me. They offer genetic testing for families if you want to find out if familial Alzheimer’s is a risk for you. More info here: https://dian.wustl.edu/for-families/genetic-counseling-and-testing/
 
Unfortunately, even if it isn’t the familial type you’re probably at some level of increased risk given your family history. The good news is you’re really young, and hopefully we will have much better treatments in a couple of decades. There are a number of great prevention studies running now too to try to stop the disease from ever taking hold. Also it’s really unlikely to get onset in 30s/40s unless you have clear family history of it starting that early (even with familial mutations). 
 
I’m really sorry to hear about your mom, it’s a horrible disease.
I can empathize with your situation a bit. We think my maternal GMA had some sort of dementia (family issues got in the way, so not sure) and my mom passed away from it about a year ago. She was diagnosed in her 60’s, but pretty sure she’d been fighting it way earlier (even her neurologist thought so). Paternal GMA was also diagnosed, but she was almost 90. I’m afraid of getting it too.

Remind yourself that you cannot control the future and not everything is in your power. However, they are making strides and they do have recommendations for avoiding it (healthy eating, avoiding sugar, exercising regularly, learning languages, etc.). All you can really do is follow the recommendations and take it day-by-day. Get your affairs in order and keep them up-to-date (power of attorney, wills/trust, etc), but live your life the best you can. No one is guaranteed a tomorrow and death is a part of living. 

It’s not selfish to take care of yourself and for caregivers, it’s one of the most important things to do. You cannot take care of someone else if you yourself are not in a good place. Find a therapist/counselor/support group if you need to. Talking it out and knowing (REALLY knowing) that others have gone through the same thing really does help.
I'm sorry. It sucks and it's not fair. My dad's mom had dementia, as did three of her siblings. My dad was so terrified of it, he once told me, if he was ever diagnosed with anything like it, to drive him to the middle of nowhere and leave him there. Well, last year he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at the age of 62.  Again, I'm sorry. You're much younger than I am and, unless he has another huge dropoff, I still have a couple more years before my dad is as far along.

I'm a little unclear as to what sort of advice you're looking for. I know that I was the first to accept what my dad was going through and had to force my mom's hand with appointments and retirement. There was a day when I broke down while I was weeding my backyard. I've cried a few times since, when I think about what I'll never have again with my dad. My siblings and I have become closer. . .I try to take it one day at a time. I have a family I love and, based on my grandmother and father's ages when they started showing symptoms, I'm doing my damnedest to make sure I'm not a burden in twenty years.

Yes, sometimes it feels callous to think practically, but here it goes: you're missing out on a chance life your life right now and that's not something a parent wants for their child. You'll do what needs to be done because you love your mom. I'm sorry that she probably won't be with us for more than a few more years, at which point you're going to be in a different kind of pain. But then you're going to get to have a chance to live for yourself and whomever else you consider your loved ones. Maybe they'll develop a definitive test or possibly a cure. Either way, I don't recommend living in fear. When you need to vent, that's what we're all here for. I'm sure there are many people on here more knowledgeable  and qualified to give mental health advice than myself. Hopefully some of them chime in too. Take care.
I am so sorry for you and your situation. It sounds trite, but keeping fit, good diet with lots of vegetables, good exercise routine are the best known defenses against the disease. We tend to move toward what we focus on, so keep positive, maybe develop a positive personal mantra that you repeat numerous times a day, such as: I am capable, healthy, and resilient, and live life to the fullest. Focus on your dreams, not your fears. I am praying for you.
I don’t really have advice, but my mom also has early onset and I worry about the same exact thing. You’re not alone.
That sucks! I always felt too young to have a mom with Alzheimer's, and she got it when I was in my 30s. I'm also terrified of getting it since there's a strong family history. But there are more and more resources when it comes to Alzheimer's prevention. I've overhauled my entire lifestyle. Start here: https://youtube.com/c/FAUMedicalSchool

Sorry to hear about this- there’s some people in your position organizing together https://www.youngtimers.org
I’m in a somewhat similar position as you. I’m a few years older (just turned 29) but didn’t expect to have to care for a parent with dementia at such a young age when I’m just starting to have a career and family of my own. My dad is suspected to have LBD at 67. Average age of onset is 78, so he is on the younger side. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s a couple of years ago but my husband and I have been noticing strange behaviours and issues with verbal processing in the past year that is much worse than is expected for his stage of Parkinson’s (stage 2).

For context, my grandparents (dad’s side) are still alive or lived to their 80s so it never crossed my mind that I would lose a parent so young.

I too share the same concerns about genetics. My other grandma had Alzheimer’s although she didn’t develop it until she was 80. Knowing the risk of dementia and Parkinson’s in my family, I did a 23andMe test and I don’t carry any of the main genes that increase my risk. So it appears that my grandma’s and dad’s dementia are likely both flukes and/or environmental. Still, I’ve been trying to do things that’s would lower my risk such as drinking 2 cups of coffee a day, making sure I get at least 7 hours of sleep each night, exercising and eating well to lower my risk of heart disease and high blood pressure as my grandma had heart disease and my dad has had high blood pressure for 20 years so I’m thinking the cardiac stressors may have something to do with it.",2022-01-21 18:01:03,bps_tv,s9njwt
Dementia,The potential pharmacological mechanisms of β-hydroxybutyrate for improving cognitive functions (Pub Date: 2022-02-01),,"from your link, amongst the concluding remarks:

""the clinical advantage of raising bOHBlevels to substantially higher levels was unknown.  Further research on these topics is definitely necessary,""

I did like link 5 though  ""Our results suggest that a ketogenic intervention targeted toward adults at risk for Alzheimer’s may prove beneficial in the prevention of cognitive decline.""",2022-01-20 15:53:25,Ricosss,s8snmp
Dementia,Is this ok?,,"In answer to OPs original question, “is this OK?” As a healthcare worker I have two answers. Morally, ethically the answer is fuck no, this isn’t OK. HCW who are contagious and sick aree being required to work with a vulnerable population. Now, that said, is this OK according to CDC regulations? Yep, sure is. The guidance states that, if a facility is in crisis staffing, which means they do not have enough staff to care for the residents, then staff can return to work with COVID with no recovery time. If I remember correctly, it is supposed to be asymptomatic positives, not staff with symptoms such as fevers, etc. But it doesn’t matter, everyone will be forced to come back regardless of symptoms. COVID will spread and people will die. I’m fucking exhausted.
This is awful. Tested positive for COVID and have to work with the elderly at risk people? That can't be true I hope.
What is the solution then?? These people need care. The way I see it, it’s a lose, lose. People not receiving care is guaranteed to be damaging/deadly. Having masked, asymptomatic positive caregivers fulfill their duties is not a guaranteed death sentence. It sucks and it, of course, is risky and can result in sickness/death, but of the two… it’s pretty clear what the better choice is. No care at all is far worse. And no, none of this is ok, but what other options are there? My opinion.
It’s not right, but the problem is so complex. We had two people die and several others are now in icu because the staff was so small at a local facility the residents were receiving terrible care. It’s a nightmare for all involved.
I worked in a hospital that had a nursing home/memory care as a clinic psychologist, and the rule was even if you were positive for COVID but asymptomatic, you had to work. So many people got COVID. We lost residents.
Also, this is why Unions are needed. If you don’t come in on your day off, you’re fired?! That’s just wrong.
Not okay at all. This needs to be published in local community.
Post on their Facebook page (include images you shared above), notify the local news media, including the tv stations (Seattle, right?).  If you prefer to remain anonymous you could send them this Reddit thread.
I suspect this is what is going on at my Oma's facility. Somehow they are having a Covid outbreak and now we can't visit.
This is a symptom of how our institutions are failing the older adults we serve and failing those who serve them. Incredibly unfortunate. We are past due for a 'care' revolution. I am so sorry you have to work under these conditions and I am so sorry for the residents who are prisoners in these communities. I worked at a large corporate community pre-Covid and I can only imagine how much More unethical the daily practices have become. Omicron long-term damages are just becoming known and is not a 'mild' variant- many who had mild or no symptoms are experiencing 'multi-inflammation syndrome' 4weeks + after original diagnosis. Stay tuned. Stay healthy. Maybe time to form a walk-out and demand health protocols for staff and residents. Call the local news team as well.
As an RN, this is not OK in any sense. Memory Care tells me the residents are elderly, probably with co-morbidities that put them at an increased risk of severe illness catching Covid. Not only that, they are not protecting their employees AT ALL or their health. The icing on the cake? It’s paid as a bonus?!?! More taxes come out of bonuses. I live in western WA and that’s happening over here, too. We went from being heroes in 2020 to dispensable in 2022
??? Bonus is taxed at a higher rate than wages. These nurses are getting hosed.
My feelings are that no, this is definitely NOT ok.

Certainly here in the UK this would be illegal. Here in the UK if you test positive for covid you are EXPECTED to isolate anyway. It’s a breach of covid rules if you don’t and any employer enforcing this kind of nonsense would be outed and heavily fined.

I’ve also no doubt that if pushed they would say that your contract doesn’t guarantee you work. In that case you don’t have to guarantee being available outside contract hours. If your contract makes no mention of “standby” or “call out” then you are under no obligation whatsoever to return to work outside of your contracted hours whether available or not.

The problem I have is that I suspect it’s in the US where the “hire and fire” rules are frankly disgusting and archaic. It’s also noticeable that they call the pitiful hourly increase “a bonus”! That’s so that they can drop it again without notice or consultation.

My third point is why the hell would anyone want to work for people like this? Care home or not. I certainly wouldn’t want my loved one staying in a place that treats its staff with this much contempt.
Good luck to you.
This is 100% why I am keeping my grandmother in her home for as long as humanly possible. She's declining but she would absolutely catch this and probably die in a facility.
Post it on the News channel’s Twitter feed. Post it everywhere until it gets picked up on the National or cable news stations.
Don't get me started on the most recent nursing home I worked for. I still technically work there, but have not really worked hours there becaise of being my Dad's care giver. It's bad enough...and not just there...that I don't think I want to go back to work as a nurse aide if anything ever happens to my Dad.",2022-01-20 04:36:43,happ22,s8f87b
Dementia,My Dad's New Behaviors,"So for starters, my dad is 79 and he was involved in a car wreck last month. He turned left in front of someone going through the yellow light. I was the passenger and sustained injuries from the airbags and he had similar injuries. The other party was not injured, but my dad's car was totaled. Now he has no car to use and is housebound, but I come over everyday to help him out. It was determined by my siblings and I that it would be best for him not to drive again. While he's been housebound, he only asks for the same meal every day and would have it for dinner if I allowed him. All he wants is a nacho bellgrande from Taco Bell. While it is true, he did like it prior to the wreck, so that's not new. He cites that ""its the only thing I know I can eat."" He will eat some other things but they also prove to sometimes be foods that he used to like, but pick at and barely eats a lot of it. 

He has not be formally diagnosed with cognitive decline, but it seems like he's showing unsettling symptoms just as recent as this weekend. He has a doctors appointment tomorrow (the 20th) and has it marked on his calendar. Well I needed to get him a few things at the store today and when I came back he was in bed and was mixed up about if it was time to leave for his appointment. I told him, no it was tomorrow. Clearly he was sundowning since it was about 5:30PM, I thought he was just hungry so i made him something, which he ate. Then after a few hours he said, ""Okay when do we need to leave for the appointment tomorrow?"" I said, ""at 9:30, I will come and pick you up and we can go around 10."" He nodded and said, ""Okay at 9:30."" Then I left and about 1 1/2 hours later, he called me and asked when do you need to leave for the appointment, to which I said ""at about 10."" He replied, ""So in thirty minutes why aren't you here now then?"" He was mixing up AM and PM. He said he had set his clock to get up, and was confused about if the appointment was 11 AM or PM. I have never seen him act like this. The appointment tomorrow isn't with his doctor but the nurse practitioner to check on his meds and see if his diabetes is still in check. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say to her if she asks. I find this behavior alarming and worrisome. Could it happen this fast? Or is it medication related? He was always good about taking his meds on time everyday. Not sure what's going on.","I hope you make sure the doctor knows about the accident; he may have had a small ( previously unnoticed) brain injury that needs to be checked out as well as testing for the cognitive decline. You can get the doctor to recommend he not drive anymore as part of the testing.

As far as the food thing goes, my MIL lives with us and she would eat a McD's cheeseburger and fries every day if you let her.
Bring up the confusion, onset, progression and your concerns with his NP.

Sometimes medications or illness can escalate symptoms
I’m guessing you thought something was amiss before since you don’t want him to drive anymore. You obviously noted a decline. So the real question is if what you are seeing as a sudden further decrease is normal. It’s hard to say. Make sure you explain all of your recent observations to the doctor. A full physical along with blood work and urinalysis is definitely called for. Urinary tract infections can cause sudden declines in cognition or even hallucinations in the elderly, so make sure a urinalysis is done.
A lot of seniors are over medicated, so of course his meds ought to be reviewed (and, how he's taking them -- if he's forgetful, he might retake and retake the same med over and over again).  

Sealed plastic dispenser packs for pills are often a free pharmacy service and might deal with that or at least make it instantly obvious what's been happening.
It may have been progressing under the radar for a while, out of your site. This kind of time problem was one of the first major things I noticed about my mum, but a lot of small things had been happening too when I looked back. I bought her a day/night clock which is big and has 'morning' 'afternoon'and so on written underneath the time. It helped a lot but didn't totally solve the problem since she needed to be able to actually see it to help work out the time.
It's really common for them to start obsessing over appointments because they can't keep the day and time straight and get really nervous about missing it. there are so many stories like this on dementia forums. It's almost better not to tell them about it in advance since it causes so much unnecessary stress.
Stress is really bad (soaks up any 'cognitive reserve').

The car accident might have traumatized/unsettled him enough that it will take months before his equilibrium is restored.
Sorry about your dad. It's hard to see them struggle with things they previously had no obvious issue with. I agree with everything everyone else is saying really. The main things that effect my mum's cognitive ability are meds, needing her VIT B12 injections, infection is a huge one, hospital stays, stress and she gets disoriented in unfamiliar surroundings (but one 100% is her dementia). 

I hope you manage to get to the bottom of things with your dad and that it turns out to be a temporary issue for him.
My dad is 72 and I think he's had something similar happen. He had a car accident in early December and even though there may have been signs of something (I can't say what it was bc I'm not a medical professional), it got far worse post crash.
Just went with my 81 year old aunt to her doctor appointment yesterday because her appetite isn’t what it used to be. She loves sweets and she would eat her favorite meal - double cheeseburger, large fry and a strawberry shake from a local restaurant - every day. I was surprised when the doctor said that was actually fine and she can have all the ice cream, scones and cakes she wants. He is more worried about her losing weight and getting weak than anything else. (He also checks her for UTIs every time.) 

Check with your dad’s doctor. He may be okay with Taco Bell every day.",2022-01-19 23:37:03,Transcendental93,s8a9iq

Dementia,"This early warning sign of dementia is often overlooked, according to a new study",,"(To save you a click, it's ""apathy."")
Lord, if it’s apathy then I’m doomed.
Here’s how that looked in my husband:  he ran our small business very well for 10 years. Good reviews, made money, paperwork in order and on time.  Then slightly almost pervasively instead of coming home with stories of his great customers he started telling more and more negative stories.  He always had a casual but professional dress code but started wearing blue jeans himself. The trigger for me was that small but important deadlines such as gov’t filings or other paperwork that were always on time were suddenly missed.  His responses to these started out as ‘Oops, I forgot’ and ended up as ‘No Big Deal’.  That’s the apathy. So slight. So minor. But I knew how he worked-he’s always been detailed and would not normally let these things slide. I saw these signs 4 years before the actual diagnosis.  For me it started out as a concern until I increasingly recognized it as cognitive.
I've been apathetic since I was 12 though; how does this get used as a warning sign then?",2022-01-19 17:47:38,rebeccajames47,s82xyy

Dementia,My Father’s Lewy Body Dementia,"My Father, 81, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s back in 2016. His disease slowly and progressively has gotten worse over time. He has the type of Parkinson’s that makes a person stiff and tense hardly has the shakes. He was fairly Lucid up until about 2 years ago. He was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia which is under the spectrum of Parkinson’s it affects his nervous system pretty aggressively. 

Physically he has a hard time moving plus the dementia has become more frequent lately. A mix of both his physical limits and dementia had caused him to fall pretty bad at least 30 times last year. He has lucid moments, but they’re less frequent. He was doing physical therapy he got better for a short while then suddenly this week as of Saturday he can barely stand or get out of bed. He was walking fine last Monday. 

Is there anything I can do to help him? Are there vitamins he can take, or can a change to his diet help? How can I get in home assistance from the state of Florida? What kind of home will he end up in if I can’t care for him anymore? It’s so heartbreaking and stressful watching someone you love deteriorate like this. I don’t know what to do.

Edit: I wanted to thank all of you guys of doing me a favor by responding. I really do appreciate it. Thanks for the help.","Is that suspected Lewy Body or have they changed the way they diagnose? I thought the only way they could definitively diagnose Lewy Body was autopsy? Maybe they've advanced a bit since my family member died of it? 

When I was dealing with this similar thing with a family member who passed from it, their dr was contemplating starting a nicorette patch to see if it would help or Ritalin. Since then, I am taking care of another family member with dementia and Ritalin is a god send. It has to do with the dopamine in the brain....there are also studies involving red light spectrum lights being placed on the head in the morning (it has to be morning due to circadian rhythm of mitochondria?) to stimulate metabolism in the brain. Also, someone on another board said sublingual B12 can help. That's all I know.

Personal note; I'm really sorry you and your loved one are going through this. It's tough. Please try take care of yourself when you can during this really difficult time. 🖖🕊
""Sudden changes"" are a red flag. Possible infection or something but you are wise to have his blood work done to rule out infections.

[LBDA.org](https://LBDA.org) is a good resource.
I'm sorry about what you and your Dad are going through. It's a dreadful disease. If you are your Dad's POA it will be your responsibility to choose a facility and admit him if you are no longer able to care for him at home (and if you can't get professionals to care for him at home.) It's a good idea to start researching this right away. You will need to know how much it will cost, how it will be paid for, and it's good to have a list of your top choices of facilities. There's a lot of legwork to research all this and sometimes facilities have waiting lists, plus if he will need Medicaid to pay for it that also takes time. That's why it's best to start now. Medicaid qualification is based on assets and income.  When his money runs out then Medicaid will step in to pay for a facility (not all facilities take Medicaid and some only take it after a certain period of private pay, this is why you need to research and plan). Regarding getting caregivers for the home, when you say ""home assistance FROM the state of Florida"" are you expecting the state to pay for it? They don't. You can contact your local Office on Aging to find out about various resources in your community and what may be of help to you. Home caregivers are $15-$30 per hour, adult daycare (in a facility) is around $60-$75 per day, and memory care or nursing homes cost around $6500-$10,000 per month. These are all ballpark figures. As you research and formulate your Plans B, C, and D it might relieve some of your stress.  If your Dad's assets or estate situation is complex, you can also talk with an Elder Law attorney to help you plan the financial end of possibly placing him in a facility in the future.
Come join Lewy body dementia carers group on Facebook. There are a ton of people who are very responsive and they share everything that they know and learned and can give you great tips on how to navigate and I’m sure one of the first things they will urge you to do is have your father checked for a urinary tract infection which causes sudden changes in those with Lewy body.",2022-01-19 10:07:55,funfettifunfunny,s7s5y5
Dementia,Assisted Living With Memory Care,Can assisted living with memory care handle patients with more severe dementia - or is a nursing home usually the ultimate destination? We have elderly relatives with mild dementia currently living in their home. They prefer to remain in their home but I have a feeling they will be better off elsewhere. I'm not sure if the typical assisted living facility with memory care is able to handle more severe dementia...or if AL is just a temporary stop before a nursing home.,"It all depends on the level of care they need.

For someone to be ""assisted living"", they still need to be able to do a good deal of things themselves. To get into assisted living, and even be able to continue living in the assisted living, need to meet certain requirements. If they do not meet those requirements, they will not be admitted to assisted living. If they decline below those requirements while living there, they would be required to move to more appropriate care. Assisted living also allows patients more freedoms to come and go, etc...so if your person needs a good deal of supervision, they still may not be allowed to go to assisted living. 

Then you have the ""memory care"". Usually, if a facility has a ""memory care"" area, they tend to have staff trained to care for individuals with dementia. But not always guaranteed. It also depends on the ""type"" of severe dementia the patient has. Usually, the patient to staff ratio is lower in a memory care unit. If the patient is still manageable to care for, even with the severe dementia, it's not an issue. But if they have behaviors so severe that they are a risk to themselves/others or would require extensive 1-on-1 supervision/care, you could run into some issues. 

And sadly, MOST good memory care centers I have come across tend to all be private pay. Don't take most insurances, and definitely don't take medicaid/medicare. 

If it is an assisted living memory care, this tends to be for more independent patients with milder dementia. Moderate to severe dementia usually impacts your ability to care for yourself, so you tend to not see moderate/advanced cases in assisted living. 

If your loved one is more moderate/severe in their dementia, more than likely you're looking at long-term nursing care (your more traditional nursing home) rather than assisted living.

(Edited for typos)
It really depends on the facility. Based on the research I did and folks I spoke to prior to placing my dad in memory care, the general answer is no, a facility which is purely assisted living won't be able to handle patients with severe dementia. They're trained and equipped to care for residents who can do a lot of things by themselves, don't engage in the kinds of challenging behaviors later stage dementia patients do, and don't need to be contained in a secure facility to prevent wandering. Likewise, a generalist nursing home also won't be a good fit, because, again, dealing with advanced dementia requires special training and ideally a facility which is arranged with the needs and peculiarities of dementia patients in mind. The best place for someone with advanced dementia is in a specialized memory care facility.

Now, I have heard of places which have both assisted living and a memory care wing for when/if residents need the higher level of care. I personally would be a bit wary of that, because it may mean that the staff doesn't necessarily have the same level of specialized training that they would in an exclusively memory care setting. Also, if the patient is aggressive, they're more likely to be evicted from a mixed setting than a memory care setting.  (Nobody wants to scare off the non-demented residents and their families.) But that really depends on the facility.
Mild dementia, currently living at home - Assisted Living should be fine. Select one that also offers Memory Care for when their dementia advances.
We put my MIL in level 1 memory care. The facility can take care of her up to the point she needs full nursing care. They can do a lot, just not skilled nursing.

In level 1 she has a smaller room and they remind her to do stuff, dispense her meds, help in the bathroom, put her to bed, etc.

They have been talking about bumping her to the next level. She has wandered at night. Apparently used the bathroom in the neighbor's place and crawled into bed with her. They said if it keeps happening... But, her new doctor gave her medication to help her stay asleep. I didn't know that they would give her meds for sundowners.

The facility does accommodate hospice care. All in all, we really like the facility. It's not cheap. But she and her husband planned for this. They didn't want to live with their children.
Assisted Living might require the MMSE test before admission. You can google a 30 question sample test and conduct an informal exam on your own. It should take less than 10 minutes. I believe a passing score would be between 21-24. Failing the test would mean the individual would be placed into a memory care facility.

It might be worth considering to have the relative be examined by their physician and be declared as “homebound” in accordance to Medicare regulations. In doing so would authorize in-home nurses and/or aids could make daily visits and paid by Medicare.

Also consider a Life Alert-type pendant if the individual is living alone.
There is a new sub r/memorycare for employees of memory care facilities who you could ask for their input as well.

I will say that if their home will be unsafe and you intend to move them eventually, doing it earlier is better, while they still have the ability to form new muscle memories as well as take advantage of the social opportunities there.
My mother has Alzheimer's and is in an assisted living/memory care facility. The building she is in has higher functioning residents, some of them even have no dementia but are there for health reasons. This is wonderful in terms of stimulation for my mother.

The other building has more of the late stage dementia patients. From what I can tell most of them just sleep most of the time, either in wheelchairs or on the sofa in the large living room area.

There are a handful of higher functioning people in there, including my father, who seem totally fine with this.

My parents will likely be out of money before my mom reaches that stage, but this place has agreed to keep her on Medicaid.",2022-01-18 10:32:30,HaroldBAZ,s706ab
Dementia,Mom’s impactful memory loss.,"Hi! First time posting. My mother (70 F) has been diagnosed with moderate dementia based on her decline over the last 18 months and her score on the MoCA test. She declined 20% in the last 18 months. To compound this, my dad (70 M) passed 4 months ago, who was her sole caregiver, though he never saw it that way. He was the person who was with her all day, scheduling her appointments (which she is not capable of doing herself) and making sure she had all of her meds ordered and taken care of. 

We are looking for a way to tell her how impactful her memory loss is to us, her caregivers (my sister and I, 32 and 30 respectively, and her brother 76) and how we need her to accept some help. She has gotten lost while driving but had gotten better with using her phone’s GPS to help her get around. She forgets many scheduled things and repeats similar stories upwards of 5 times in a short time frame. We are in the process of hiring companion care to keep her company and help her around the house a few days a week. 

Along with being frustrated, we know this isn’t her fault but it does impact our lives by worrying about her daily. Any suggestions for gently bringing up and reiterating how impactful this is for her family and how we can work together to make this journey a little easier for all of us?  Thanks for your help!","Unfortunately one of the capacities that is compromised by the disease is self-awareness and awareness of other people's emotional states. So she may not be able to perceive that there is a problem, even if you explain it to her. Or she may understand it for a day, and then the next day not remember the conversation. So what I'm saying is that you will probably need to take actions to protect her without her understanding them or consenting to them. 

For example, it's time to talk to her doctor about the end of her driver's license (depending on the regulations in your area). Try to attend an appointment or send them an email. It's important to get power of attorney sorted out before she is too far gone. Then you can protect her better.
I would definitely try to frame it more from the point of view that ""we're concerned about you and want to make sure you are safe and have companionship and help around the house so that you don't have to worry about anything"" than ""here's how your disease is impacting our lives."" While it might be true that your lives are hugely impacted, you don't want her to feel like she has done something wrong and above all you need to keep your relationship with her positive. She likely can't grasp the full impact anyway. I know my FIL couldn't, and dumping my frustration about the impact his disease had on my life when he had already experienced enough cognitive decline to get lost driving to the places he had been going for 20 years and get scammed day after day by the same people wasn't going to help either of us. Best to put the focus on her and demonstrate how the changes you want will help her. I'm no expert, just my two cents.
First of all hugs.  Caring for a loved one with dementia is hard on so many emotional, and physical levels.  Saying all that, what I am about to say next, it hurts to say as I have been in your shoes before.

With what you have written above, it sounds like it may have progressed beyond what companion care can provide  a few days a week.  If she is forgetting scheduled things, that is not far removed from forgetting she has something on the stove and starting a fire.  Getting lost while driving is also concerning. A car is more than a thing to get you from point a to point b, is a dangerous piece of machinery that she is operating impaired. 

As for how to talk to her, I think you are on the right track.  There will probably still be moments of clarity for her, take advantage of those moments to talk to her calmly, earnestly, and get everything in place to help her on this marathon you are just starting.  Be patient with the stories, and enjoy them - yes even for the 5th time. They will only last for so long before she loses the memory of them. When you start to get frustrated, try to make a game out of responding to the story, how many different ways can you respond?    Try not to get angry with her as the memory issues progress, she has to be just as frustrated as you are, and the emotional memory will last longer for her than what you just talked about.  So she will know you are angry or frustrated, and not understand why.

Build your team of care takers, and have a self care plan.   Talk to her doctors, and find someone you can talk to as well.
Do you have a long term plan? One that you all would agree to if she also agreed?  In home care? Assisted living? Having her move in with one of you?

It might be easier to bring up the conversation with her after you will have developed a plan of action that you can guide her towards. She’s not going to be able to help you problem solve. Identify the best solution for your family (and have some back up plans), present it to her and work on her to accept it before it becomes too late.
My husband used to tell his patients that it was better for them to make these decisions while they could be an active participant than wait until they had a crisis and had to depend on someone else to make their decisions.

And do any of you have a power of attorney?  That would be helpful for so many things.  It does  not take away her power to make decisions, but it would allow you to assist with matters that might be too complicated for her to do alone.  It would also allow you to take care if things ""behind the scenes,"" if necessary.  

Source:  used my POA to set up Mom's bills for auto-pay.  She had resisted it ""because I want to know it got paid, by putting it in the mailbox myself.""  Now that her dementia has progressed, she doesn't insist on paying bills herself, and I don't have to do it, either.
What's your objective?  To get her to worry about her impact on others?

Stress is Not Good, for anyone with mild cognitive impairment, as they have little enough cognitive reserve to have such an added distraction.  That she can learn a new process (use of her phone's GPS) is good news.

Do you have time to invest in helping her eat more healthy?  I think much dementia is influenced by years and decades of poor dietary practices.",2022-01-18 10:03:50,Cbark2580,s6zjsn
Dementia,What can scammers do with my Grandmother's Medicare card number and insurance card number?,"They didn't ask for her social security number or credit/debit cards or anything. And what do I need to do about it? They apparently told her they were from Medicare and were sending her a benefit, and since she'd just been to the hospital a couple days ago she believed them.","Insurance fraud. Get medical procedures done, submitted with her insurance instead of theirs.  I would imagine part of a broader Medicare/Medicaid fraud scam that also involves providers. There is a risk she gets her Medicare canceled and it can only be reinstated when the stuff gets worked out.

Dementia,It's happening so fast!,"I'm here to vent. I already have solutions in place and in motion. 

My Mom was diagnosed with Dementia late 2019.  Her decline has been steady; however, the last six weeks her decline has been significant.

She's wet her pants two days in a row, she's wandered the house twice, she has stopped eating some  foods she liked two months ago because they don't look right (she often thinks green veggies are bugs) she will argue about taking her pills, I have to hide bread and tortillas  because if I don't she will eat four sandwiches a day, I have to hide her SlimFast ( she has one for breakfast) or she'll drink three or more a day, and she's forgetting more words.

My anxiety is through the roof and, honesty, I'm really scared.

If I can get through caring for her without completely losing it, it'll be a miracle.","I’m so sorry you are going through this. It sound absolutely terrible to be in your position & even when you are struggling with it; you are so so brave. I think it’s so important to reach out to local support groups not only for your mother, but for yourself. You can’t expect to carry this mental burden all on your own. I hope you find support & a way to reduce your anxieties. I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help!
It gets so much worse. I'm so sorry.
Just when I think I've seen the worst of this disease,my loved ones dementia says nope you ain't seen nothing yet!   An example of this is when my LO confused his shaving razor for his toothbrush. Luckily I was there and nothing bad happened. Since then I'm right there with him when he needs any personal care things done. I'm sorry for the person going through this and the exhausted, underappreciated caregivers.
I wish you strength on this sad journey.
It’s so hard to watch. I’m sorry you are going through this right now. I’m sending you lots of internet hugs, you aren’t alone
Dementia sucks.

My dad ate food he never did his entire life. We pretty much gave him regular breakfast, lunch and dinner foods. He had snacks also. We often had the argument about taking his meds but we bribed him, if need be, with his favorite cookies. He refused to drink water until probably the last 2 months of his life, then he drank it all day. He wore diapers, but would still use the bathroom, sometimes he made, sometimes not. I'm not a doctor but I would say let her eat whatever she wants and yes she will lose speech. We had my dad on ensure at his doctor's suggestion. We had a book about dementia with helpful information. The information from hospice was helpful also. 

Work with her physician to assess her needs and give some direction

Dementia sucks
In the US, Alzheimer’s Assoc has a 24/7 365 days/yr phone helpline. Call even if you’re at your wit’s end or you’re not even sure what to ask. They’re excellent!!  800-272-3900. 
US: [www.alz.org/help-support](www.alz.org/help-support)
Canada: [www.alzheimer.ca/en/help-support](www.alzheimer.ca/en/help-support)
UK Alzheimer’s Society: [www.alzheimers.org.uk](www.alzheimers.org.uk)

Their websites offer help & support and info about dementia that helped reduce my anxiety. It’s easier to take when I know what to expect. Instead of dread when faced w/a new loss of function, I  recognize the change and feel like I know what’s happening and how to face it… “Ah, this is where we are now 🧐👆” vs “Arrrrggghhh!!! 😫😭” 

One thing that really helped me is to adjust my perspective. I’m mourning the loss of the mom I expected to have (no dementia) and I’m learning to accept the mom I do have. Bless you on your dementia journey. You are not alone!
So many familiar, sad stories.  My dad was pretty stable for about 6 years but has rapidly declined these last 6 months.  We can’t leave any food in his  house (he lives in a house behind my sister’s house, more or less like a wing of her house) because he feeds it to his (overweight) dog and/or will eat it all himself (even if it is frozen, or uncooked, or spoiled).  He eats like a thrasher but is losing weight.  He tries to comb his hair with his toothbrush, shave with a comb, he often wears 2 pair of pants w/belt or 3 or 4 shirts or 2 different shoes, each on the wrong foot.  His current thing is to make piles of his belongings on the front porch, and then spends the entire day re-arranging (at least he is busy).
My Dad has been in hospice care for advanced dementia for over a year now.  He could stand up and take small steps to his chair last year.  Now he cannot stand up without collapsing and is stuck in bed now.  Changing his diapers now is a huge challenge because he doesn’t want to be touched down there and clinches his legs together.  He fights back.  He yells at the top of his lungs.  He screams.  This is something I’ve kinda sorta adjusted to.  I use tips and tricks.  I sedate him.  Some mornings are better than others but it really really sucks!  OP has no idea what is yet to come.
Yeah, i get it. All i can say is that you will probably get used to what's happening and then things will change again. 
 I'm my father's full-time caregiver and I'm up close and personal with all of it. Lots of tough times.
Small update: 

Got a urine sample in this morning so test results should be back in a day or two. I spoke with Mom's neurologist and told him *everything.*  He said it's all a hallmark of UTI, so that was reassuring.  I also found out I can't up her meds if it isn't a UTI, she's on the highest doses of Memantine and Donezepil, which is good to know.  

Anyway, feeling relieved a little bit.  Hopefully the test results will confirm.
Hey! I think a lot of this is due to a UTI!  I'm waiting to hear back from her PCP about an order for a urinalysis. 

I'll try to keep you all updated.
Get therapy stat. I actually started an additional day and new meds for my self and more exercise . It’s happening so fast I’ve been here two weeks and every day is different. I’m currently working on selling her home and moving her close to me into a nursing home. Two days ago she just took her pants off in the middle of the room for no reason. And when I asked her she said I don’t know and I said did you go to the bathroom she said no. And she didn’t she just took her pants off. 

It is so scary and so upsetting and I’ll pray for you. In the meantime take his best care of yourself as you can! Drink plenty of water sleep exercise eat well.

I’m blessed that I have an asset where I can spend her money to get her really good care but there are lots of volunteer organizations that will come so you can have a break, there are daycare programs, etc. etc.

Dementia,Update on my nan,"1st here is a little [back story](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s3sxy3/my_nan_has_dementia_really_bad_had_a_heart_attack/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Today i finally got up there. Not only to see her but to give my aunt a break. My dear sweet aunt hasn't left the hospital since Nan was admitted Thursday. When i got there i told her to go home, shower take a nap do whatever you need to do i got this. But she stay at the hospital and hung out in the lobby incase the Drs came. Now i know where I got my dedication, compassion, patients might as well throw being stubborn in the mix. I took care of my nan for about 6 hours. And i enjoyed every moment. Even when she was having aggression episodes. 

My nan is stage 7 of dementia so for her to communicate is nearly impossible. She can't tell where it hurts or why or what level of pain we (aunt and i) can only go by from her actions. 

She did have a heart attack but no blood clot! But she has compound fractures in 4 of her vertebrate. My aunt and i can't not figure out why or how. The home she was in hadn't reported a fall in months. 

I just so happy to be a help to her and my aunt. I brushed her hair helped with lunch and even bathroom moments. She laid in the bed for a good while happy playing with her doll folding hand towels while i sat next to her. She even reached out and held my hand for about 45 mins. 

I feel better now i got there talked to the Drs and my aunt. Don't get me wrong i love my dad and I love that he takes his time to call me with updates. But i get alot of ""i don't know"" when i ask that or this. 

To those who commented on my previous post, thank you for the kind words and support.","Dementia sucks and it’s hard to watch your loved making that transition. Our dad died in June at home on hospice. My 4 siblings and I took care of him around the clock for 2 1/2 years and would do it again in a heartbeat
Treasure the times when she “more present”

If she didn't fall maybe her bones have lost strength, so any harsh movement was enough to fracture them.",2022-01-16 21:37:51,Super_Shawnda,s5sqgl
Dementia,Dilemma of dementia,"This illness is so sad. I've (f39) just recently had to put my mum (74) into care. We lost my dad (72) back in February and didn't know mum had Dementia. Apparently, she was diagnosed back in 2018, but he kept her secret for her and took on her care. 

I've worked really hard to have a really fulfilling relationship with them both over the past 20 years. I grew up with their alcoholism and it really effected me, but I sought help and it changed my life and let me find acceptance for their drinking. When dad passed our relationship was wonderful and my heart was broken. My mum had lost her rock and the love of her life. 

The shock of realising my mum wasn't just drunk, but in fact had dementia as well was like a second blow. It was clear they had been struggling. I tried to take on the things my dad had been doing, brought in cares, set up a new poa and had my two brothers help with looking after her at night. 

She's prone to infection and sure enough this led to a bad fall even in strong antibiotics. After that I realised I couldn't keep her safe. The three of us were working during the day, had cameras installed, neighbors keeping and eye out, but she was still drinking, wandering and landed in the hospital. She always said she never wanted to got into a care home, but I really didn't have another choice. The decision was excruciating, but there was no way she would have made it to Christmas. 

I found her a beautiful care home after months of hell., Hospital, intermediate care and assessments. 

Today I went to see her and she was looking amazing. She's out on weight, doesn't drink and was having a very low day. Telling me she couldn't stay there and she wanted to come live with me. I live in a top floor flat and she would never make it up the stairs, but on top of that she would still be at home all day herself and we would be back to square one. 

It's so hard to not just bin my life and commit to looking after her. It's what my dad would have done. But I feel like it still wouldn't be enough. 

Having to tell her that I can't take her home is heartbreaking. The codependent in me wants to scoop her up and take her with me, but in my head I know it's not the answer. Some days this illness is just shit.","I’m sorry you’re going through this. It’s tough, but you seem to have made a good decision. It really is  better for her to be cared for by medical professionals. And this way the relationship you’ve worked so hard to cultivate is preserved as best as it can be. Wishing you all the best.
So sorry for you. I'm in the same position. My mom is a heavy drinker and now shes in a home, she constantly asks to come home but I work all day and she's now gotten to where she can't do basic things for herself. I feel so down and depressed when I leave her but I know if she was home, she'd find a way to still drink. When I visit, she is able to have conversation with me almost like old times and I'll start thinking I can just bring her home and she'll be fine. But then the conversation turns and all the reasons I can't come snowballing down. It's like being stuck in the movie groundhog day....same thing every day
You truly made the right decision! Even if you were to quit your job and stay home with her, you wouldn't be able to keep her safe. She would be at risk of drinking again and could otherwise be a danger to herself.

My stepmom covered up my dad's dementia, too. We realized how bad it was when she died.

I'm taking care of him now, but we was in assisted living for awhile until it became obvious he needed a much higher level of care and there wasn't enough left over after the sale of their house. By the time he came to live with us, he was past the aggressive stage (mostly) and wasn't too hard to care for. If we didn't have a one story house, though, I don't think we could have cared for him ourselves.
40% of caregivers to Alzheimer’s patients die of stress related disease **before the patient**. Trying to clean up their messes and rearrange their whole world so they don’t hurt or embarrass themselves… it is exhausting.

if you keep tabs on her conditions at the care home and advocate for her when things aren’t right, you have done your due diligence. also if you’re not the one yelling at her and telling not to do stuff all the time, your relationship with her will be better for it.
How did you finally manage to find a home? I’m in that process now and it’s awful
That is so tough. But let's be realistic: you do not have a functional relationship, and if you bring her home, you would both fall into old patterns. She is in a much better place now.
You did the right thing,  you have to take care of yourself to take care of her.  Add an Alexa show so you can drop in on her and talk to her face to face for a few minutes every day may help. I check on my dad that way every day.
This reminds me of my struggle with my mother. My grandmother and I had discovered after her Wericke's diagnosis that she would still go down to the liquor store and get wine. She would order it through apps on her phone, too. Even after recovering from an acute stage where she couldn't even recognize the rooms in her own home.

I struggle with the idea of bringing my mother home from assisted living as well. It's better for her. She doesn't get drunk all day. She's eating properly and putting on good weight.

Dementia,Can you wonderful people on here please show my mom some support,she thinks no one understands what she is going through. Ive vented on here a lot but my mother needs some support. She thinks no one can understand how hard it is to cope with everything she has to do for  my dad.He has vascular dementia got it after having a stroke.,"Im so sorry for you both. When my uncle got dementia it was brutally hard on my aunt. Every year she hosted Xmas Eve, and in his first year of full on dementia my uncle had twice gotten into the car and driven off, where hours later local law enforcement would find him, once at the airport. In that year she tearfully admitted she didn’t know if she could handle Xmas eve, but wanted to host, in case it was his last. we all took on the “duties” she would normally have done herself. Food, drink etc… in the afternoon, I arrived early to clean bathrooms and decorate. I found my cousin and aunt carrying a huge potted plant to the yard. Uncle had pulled his diaper down and taken a poop in it. 

Auntie was in tears, cousin was white as a ghost.  At first I started to cry, but as I took the plant from my aunt I began to laugh, and so did she. We laugh cried for a good 20 minutes, and then hugged and cried some more. Tell your mom to lean on everyone in her life, because its the only way to get through. 

And thank you for being a kind and empathetic child to her.
Thank you for being so supportive to your mom,that's awesome! I sympathize with careing for a loved one with vascular dementia and it truly is the most hardest thing to go through for everyone involved. For me personally I'm tired and a nervous wreck most of the time like right now I'm currently taking a breather to write this. Sending you and your mom loads of internet sympathy for this awful disease.
Coping with my dear grandmother's slide into dementia was perhaps the hardest thing I've ever done. I hated seeing what that disease did to her. I don't have any answers as to how to fix it. But I wanted you to know that I empathize with both you and your mother. I've been there and it's awful and there's just no fix except maybe knowing that others out there understand what you're going through. Peace.
Thank you, u/StudentTeacher278 's mom! It's a rough road, and one of the greatest kindnesses any human can show. Went through it with dad as he struggled with the end-days of renal failure and dialysis. Struggling with it now with my life-partner of ~25 years. It's exhausting, punch-a-hole-the-wall infuriating, and heartbreaking all at the same time. I think of myself as ""earning my crown in heaven."" And I'm not even the type to believe in the whole ""crowns in heaven"" iconography as literally true.
My father has dementia and vascular dementia.  A lot of mini strokes.  My Mum looked after him for as long as she could.  She looked after his catheter, helped him toilet on a commode in the living room (bathroom is upstairs), got up in the night for him, fed and gave him bed baths.  I think the worst of it for a spouse is that they want YOU.  It doesn't really matter what kind of help you have and how good they are, your husband/wife wants you.  24/7. I know exactly what your Mum's talking about.  And that she's tired.  And it's heartbreaking to watch your loved one deteriorate.  With my Dad it took a urinary tract infection almost killing him, the hospital said he couldn't go home.  I would urge your Mum to look for some online support.  And to accept any help offered.  Take care
My Mom has Vascular dementia. My husband and I moved across country to care for her. It’s sad to see her going downhill a little bit every month. It’s sad to see her face as it is now with empty eyes and slack jaw. She has some OCD type of behaviors that have creeped up. She comes into our room at night for various reasons. Now she refuses to take her meds. I’m tired and I want to run away. I find myself angry and over sensitive. I’m easily triggered. I try so hard to keep a positive attitude but sometimes I’m just too tired to try.  This is just an awful disease but please know you are not alone and you need to diligently set time aside to do good things for yourself.(((((((hugs)))))))
Bring a partner to someone who has dementia has got to be the hardest job in the world. I really feel for my father being my mothers carer and also partner. Your mother’s struggles are so so valid and there are so many people feeling exactly how she feels. I hope she finds the support and community she needs in order to solve the lonely feeling caused by this disease. Best of luck to your family.
My dad is the primary caretaker of my mother. I live pretty far but I Skype him a few times a week, about every couple days, and just let him talk about whatever he wants to. I’m trying to visit more often, it cheers them all up and I can do little things to help. I know this is not what he wanted for his life, he’s worked so hard over the years and now he’s retired he’s taking care of my mother full time. Truly devoted. She’s entirely dependent on him and only wants him. Caretakers are truly living saints.",2022-01-16 13:15:21,StudentTeacher278,s5hrf0
Dementia,Dementia is Hereditary. Does anyone else feel their cognitive and memory abilities decline!?!?,"My mother has Frontotemporal Dementia and I feel like I’m slowly developing it myself!! Its very scary because I’m only 32 and I have a family. I occasionally lose my train of thought. This used to never happen to me and it’s happening more frequently. I’m also forgetting names mostly of people I haven’t seen in a long time but I used to be really good with names. What’s most concerning is that I keep having vision problems and weird fog-headed “headaches”. It comes and goes but it doesn’t feel right.  Ive always been physically active and my diet has never been horrible so it’s not some obese problem. I went to the doctor and I’m pending blood test results and she also scheduled me for a brain scan, or whatever is called. My sister and I are both so worried about getting it, that I am not ruling out paranoia, but they’re still a concerning symptoms.

Does anyone have any relatives that described their symptoms before they had full on dementia???

I apologize in advance if this is a question that’s asked frequently. Dementia was never in my radar and I knew nothing about it before my mom got it. From my understanding FTD is the least know type of “Dementia”. I honestly thing that when it is understood better, it will not even be classified as Dementia but a different neurological disease that affects the brain.

Thank you all in advance for the comments. 

PS- new to Reddit and I’m loving this community.","I’m glad you are seeing a doctor about it. It could be as “simple” as stress. Having a loved one dealing with FTD is certainly stressful. I do think worrying about my husband has affected my memory and cognitive function some. The brain can only do and deal with so much at a time. I think I’m pushing it to do more than it can easily do. Perhaps you are the same.
I'm 44.  I forget the names of things alot.  Like for example, I'm excellent at Jeopardy.  But the past few years, I still know most of the answers on Jeopardy but cannot think of the name of the things.  It's like the word is hanging right in front of me just out of my grasp.  Then when the answer is said, I'm like arrrghh I knew that.  I chalk it up to too much weed and ecstasy in my 20's.  But after taking care of my dad this past week I'm terrified.

I will not get this disease.  Period.  I am actually so scared about it I am trying to find where Euthanasia is legal and what that is required to get that done.  Also, how do I get tested?  Is there even a test for it?

I'm also 32 and I've attributed caretaking for my mom to some of my random moments. The amount of stress and lack of sleep ive had in the past year and a half has mentally drained me...But when I'm back in my own space for a few days and can mentally recharge I feel completely normal again and all of the ""how the hell did I miss that last week"" type of thoughts take over. I do believe I'll decline from mental exhaustion, but not from this disease.
Definitely see a doctor. I've had brain fog, vision issues etc and I've recently been diagnosed with early pre menopause. I have a consultation next month and can't wait to get the hormones I desperately need. I did have concerns around dementia because my mum has it, but it's vascular and probably more linked to her mini stroke rather than a hereditary type. Thing is that menopause untreated can lead to dementia among other things, so it's best to get checked out. Good luck.
There are moments where I feel the same (can’t come up with the right words, forget names etc.). My grandmother and mother have dementia, so it runs on my mom’s side. Tbh I will take a 21 and me genetic test this year to rule out if I have the enzyme that is linked to dementia.
I mean, if you're really worried about it you should go see a specialist.
I have an appointment Tuesday as like you dementia runs in my family and at 52 I’m showing signs. So is my 50yr old sister. I was told I could be tested for the gene but refused it as I didn’t want to know but now I’m showing signs I cannot ignore it. Like you I’m paranoid.
Are you feeling stressed?  (perhaps especially after hearing about your mom's diagnosis and hearing it has a 'hereditary' component).  Moderate to high levels of stress can cause all sorts of psychological symptoms, memory problems such as misplacing things and forgetting something that happened recently are classic.  

You could try reducing your stress (might help, can't hurt).  An effective way I've found are meditation breaks, periods of just sitting in a quiet setting for 20 minutes or so (30 works even better for me), trying not to dwell on anything at all except your breathing, which should be consciously controlled to a relaxed, slow pace.  The first few days of trying this are likely the hardest, most people can readily adapt to it after some practice.

The net result for me has been:  I sleep better, am not 'on edge' nearly so much, and the day's bumps and annoyances have far less weight and impact on shaking me up.
Get all your thyroid stuff tested. Stress can also
Make you forgetful!
If your criteria is that you are forgetting things that were more relevant to your life years ago, keep in mind too that we just tend to have more trouble retrieving old information over time, as the longer we love the more collective information there is to sort through. More people we used to know. A longer and longer list of names of old friends and acquaintances to sort through. The more information that is stored the more our brains have to sort through when we retrieve information. And the longer we go with information not being relevant the less likely we are to be able to recall it easily. For example through college I could still remember how to do long division, which I hadn’t used actively since high school. But in the years since that information has gotten more and more distant. If I use memory cues of looking up the technique, it will come back for a short time. But quickly it becomes hard to retrieve again. I can’t remember names of classmates, but looking at photos or yearbooks will trigger memories I had completely lost. So some of the loss of those kinds of things may just be a matter of memories getting farther and farther out in time and becoming more distant, such that the retrieval pathway weakens and gets hard for your brain to travel.
My mom has dementia, like her mother before her. One of her sisters is headed down the same path, just basnt gotten as far. The youngest sister is terrified and so am I. I'm just hoping I take after my dad's side in this  respect.  

What can ya do, though.  I take fish oil and hope for the best.
I’m worried about it for sure. My mother’s cousin had it, she has it. They say depression in your 20s points to a higher incidence of dementia later in life and I was in bad shape back then. Oh and I have MS which causes brain shrinkage. I’m in my 40s and already when I’m tired I get disoriented and can’t make decisions. It doesn’t look good for me.  I’m alone. My mother and aunt had devoted caring partners who cared for them. I don’t have that or kids.    

People mean well and try to tell me that it’s not a sure deal. But for me it’s like when I got the results of my MRI and the lesions were present and that meant MS and so I knew, before the dr gave me the official diagnoses, I feel the same way now about this.   

Anyway I push it out of my head and focus on today.
Happy you went to the doctor. Any chance you’re ADHD?
Sorry you are dealing with this. If you are sure your mom has hereditary FTD you can enroll in the ALLFTD study which has sites all over the US https://www.allftd.org . You would see an expert in genetic FTD. Most neurologists will know nothing about it.

I'm 53 and beginning to notice things in myself that I saw with my mother who had dementia. I am very concerned as well. I'm trying to figure out where to start for testing etc.
I take care of my Uncle, (he's on hospice now) he, my Dad and Aunt all have had or passed from dementia, I had his doctor do a genetics test to see if his was inherited, it wasn't. 
They all have type two diabetes, and lived isolated lives with no exercise. 

I did not take the test myself because it can mess up you getting Long term care insurance,
It was covered by Medicare, so have your Mom tested, I also can be forgetful but like others I feel it's stress.",2022-01-16 12:42:52,Vick17155171,s5h18b
Dementia,Does schizophrenia fall under dementia?,"My mother thinks people are taking her things. She has become violent and is verbally abusing everyone. 
I am not sure if they correlate.","My grandma and mom both had dementia and both would swear people were taking things from them. My grandma accused me of stealing her cans of coffee she'd stocked up. I don't and never have drank coffee. When I asked her what she thought I was doing with it, since she knew I didn't drink it, she said,""Probably selling it."" Because apparently there was a black market for store brand coffee.

My mom saw things all the time. Including swearing there was a bear in the top of her pine tree. In Indiana where there are no bears.
Schizophrenia falls under Schizophrenia.  

But what you're describing seems more of a psychosis.  If your mother has dementia and there is a sudden change in behaviour, a doctor might order a urine test.  UTI's can wreak havoc in dementia patients.
Psychosis can be very common in dementia patients, especially in the evening (you might want to read about sundowning). It’s a sign of progression of the illness, but it can be treated. This should be presented to a clinician.
I thought these things were common with dementia, no? Not so much the violence, but definitely people taking your things? 🤔
Psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and paranoia delusions can be a feature, yes. However, even if the symptoms can be similar, it's not the same as schizophrenia, since the underlying cause is not the same. It also depends on the individual and the dementia type. It's more common with dementia with Lewy Bodies (my dad came up with some delusions that were positively wacky) but I understand that it can come up in any dementia. And the 'people are stealing my stuff' thing is SUPER common, I think because after a certain point they can no longer keep track of their stuff but don't realize it so their brain comes up with 'people are stealing my stuff!' to explain why things seem to disappear or move around on them.

The really important thing to bear in mind is that, as insane as their beliefs seem to us, to them it's very real, so you can't argue with them. You have to empathize (not necessarily agree, but make sympathetic noises like, 'I'm sorry, that must be really scary.' and other things to indicate that you understand their feelings even if you don't share their beliefs), distract, redirect, find and eliminate the environmental triggers (if you can) and sometimes put them on anti-psychotics if behavioral interventions aren't enough. 

Thinking of triggers/quick fixes, with your mom's particular delusion, are there specific things she fixates on, like a wallet? If so, one thing you could do is to buy and stash multiples somewhere she won't find them, and then 'help' her find 'her' wallet (or whatever it is) when the issue comes up.

Also, yes, if this came on suddenly, UTIs can really throw dementia patients for a loop, and it's worth getting her tested if only to rule it out.
One of the things with dementia is that their short term memory is gone. So if they put their purse, money, coffee, whatever in a safe spot, later they don’t remember where that new spot is, and they don’t remember that they moved it. When they go to where it used to be and should be, and it’s not there, someone must have stolen it.  

They often “remember” that someone has stolen their things while they continue to move their things to new and illogical (to us but definitely not to them) places, which they don’t remember doing.
My grandma just started acting like this earlier in the week and I thought the same thing but like someone else said its more psychosis
Here is a relevant article from the New York Times that you may want to check out:

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/11/health/nursing-homes-schizophrenia-antipsychotics.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuonUktbfqohkQVUaAibVUNEjsh3Bg-XV2706iTr-Ky2YUnNZxOQUEY-Y-13AY6tqItI1wzWDX85KMLgzRfdpiO9DOkgnAy-Znqy5orVXaSMktdD0GWosw5PGWb1_rzPjNjayIes6lefk4lfbOjW9RKzagiU-dlkzqZsycFr82yZf1b6FRrAuoqR23f4hA5p8QTsAdXPK66GuU0MiTY3AOhLM6QA2WPVbWSXQmrOf7LEDcQZQDDHWXS81oDZ8uJ4HZoRhbOuoJAUgecH-nbwSFmZqSY-tDJUzTIHS_K54i3Q1ycSiKkxTDui-MOd3KA&smid=url-share

They also did an episode of The Daily podcast (also NYT) on this topic with the same people featured in the article.
Paranoia is often associated with people who have dementia but UTIs can cause it, too. My 81-year old aunt’s doctor, who mainly sees geriatric patients, always tests her urine, no matter why she came in.
This very much sounds like both so it’s hard to say. I think it probably it very dependant on age and experience. Obviously early onset Alzheimer’s could be at play as well. It think definitely best to get her seen by a psychiatrist or even a GP if you are not able to access that sort of health care. Best of luck to you and your mother.",2022-01-16 01:28:38,absu34,s55khc
Dementia,"My mother has dementia, it's pretty advanced now and my father wants to put her somewhere with memory care.","But he's not sure how to do it or what to do or where to do it. Are there any online tools that can show memory Care homes by region or by state that I could look up and give him some starting points. I had to find him his at home nurse care, he couldn't figure that out and I was happy to help.","Try contacting your local council on aging.
I agree, reaching out to DSHS or your local aging and disability program will be very helpful. My grandmother's social worker was very knowledgeable of the memory care facilities in the area, and told me exactly which ones took care of their residents the best. Social workers spend a lot of time in these facilities, and can give you their honest opinions. Best of luck and I hope you're able to find a suitable place for her. My grandma is so happy where she is now...happiest I've seen her in over 5 years.
So sorry, it's hard.    Contact your areas dementia .org or alzheimers .org.  Expert professionals, tons of resources, info, counselling - even usually have telephone help-lines, etc..   good luck!
[caring.com](https://caring.com) will provide you options and help you navigate - you don't pay them - they give you choices and make appointments for you to visit and once YOU make he decision then the home pays them. That is what happened when we had ONE week to find a place for my FIL. It was a blessing as we didn't even know where to begin.  Good luck
As someone else mentioned, contact the Alzheimer's Association at [alzheimers.org](https://alzheimers.org). They can help find care facilities, and can also help to find an elder care attorney to assist in applying for Medicaid if need be. Memory care facilities and/or nursing homes are expensive, and quite a number of MCFs are private pay only. My father drained his bank account in less than a year and a half and had to come home to live with my wife and me (we didn't know we could apply him for Medicaid at the time). Once he came home and eventually required a higher level of care than we could provide, we contacted the AA, who helped us find a lawyer and get him into a covered facility.",2022-01-15 20:45:38,buffalo_Fart,s50aqr

Dementia,My mom is only 56 and has dementia,"I really don’t know what to post here, I guess this is an “off my chest” moment. 

About four years ago she started having memory issues and she lost her job because of it. Fast forward today, she can barely have a conversation with me. It’s even worse because I live on the other side of the world so I barely get to talk to her. The only saving grace is that my step-father is a tremendous help, beyond patient, and caring for her. I owe him a lot. 

When I came back for the holidays, it just crushed me. She used to be this brilliant biologist who had a passion for monkeys and apes, and now she just sits there on her iPad most of the time watching daytime tv. Her and I are only children so most of our family is dead, and the family that is left has forgotten about us. She has friends that occasionally pop by to check in on her, but it’s not enough. I can see that in her eyes.

There’s so many questions and “what ifs” that swim in my head on a daily occurrence. “How much worse is it going to get?”, “Will she even recognise me when I come back for a visit?”, “Is there anything that I could do to make this better?”, “What is the likelihood that I will have the same fate?”. 

I’m just lost. Her and I are navigating through different fogs. It’s not fair. It’s not fucking fair. My want my Mom back. I miss her so so much.

EDIT: Wow, thank you all so much for your helpful advice and support. I’m so touched that so many of you reached out, I cannot thank you enough!!!!","I'm a senior (and former chemist) who has been researching dementia causes and preventive steps \[I was also a family caregiver who put in over ten years looking after my parents, who both became demented\], so I've been motivated to dig into this topic.

Take this with a grain of salt but a few harmless steps that may stop (and just possibly modestly reverse her symptoms) imo include:

\-excellent gum care (inflamed gums are now recognized as passing along the inflammation to the brain's tissues, even gum pockets >3 mm but especially any >5 mm may be seen as very likely contributors to dementia [my tips on this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sktm5o/things_i_wasnt_prepared_for_a_one_year/hvrtkgr/?context=3)

\-a great diet:  eight or more servings per day of fruits and vegetables; (and/or perhaps even much better, a shortcut:  a few ounces of concord grape juice per day \[France's low dementia rate's attributed to their concord grape based wine drinking, same effect's been shown for unfermented concord grapes\], and, sprinkling a tsp of turmeric (a bland, yellow spice) on one or all meals each day (a concept derived from India's having 1/4 the rate for dementia of westerners along with their using curry as a food staple)

\-we get our B12 from our intestinal digestion, which fades as we age.  Blood tests may show she's too low on B12 levels (a good target level imo is 'high normal'), if using a supplement just in case or in response to blood test results, methyl cobalamin 'under the tongue' tablets are excellent (I actually noted a modest improvement in my mom's recall shortly after starting that with her -- this was long before I'd researched the dementia topic generally)
There's also lion's mane mushroom and potentially caffeine to treat or slow the progression.
Hang in there OP!  I feel for you and this is very hard.  Read up on early onset dementia by googling it and relying on trusted sources.  Embrace the now.
I feel you. Dementia is such a heartbreaking and terrifying illness. Luckily it progresses slowly in most cases. I know how terrible it is to lose your parent like that. But it's important to stay in the moment and appreciate what is still left of your mom! 

My dad has had dementia for about 9 years now and I remember having sleepless night because I was terrified about him forgetting about me. It did happen, but it took 9 years and in those years I had so many beautiful moments with him to remember.

It is healthy to be realistic, but always keep in mind that there is still time to make great memories and time to prepare yourself for what's gonna come.
Also, I took a lot of pictures with my dad to capture every good moment and looking at those pictures just helps a lot. Maybe that might help you too!
And talk about it! Look for a local dementia supportgroup, talk to friends, family or even a therapist. You're not alone.

I just wish you a lot of strength and perseverance! I know you got this.
Wow. This feels so incredibly similar to my own predicament with my dad. He’s 54 and was finally diagnosed a little over 2 years ago after losing his job of 20+ years. like you said, the difference in how he is now and how he used to be is so heartbreaking. It’s so hard to see someone who was so smart and had so much drive and was full of life turn into someone who just sits and mindlessly watches the computer screen all day and can’t form coherent sentences or understand any of the things you say anymore. 

My extended family has all but forgotten/ditched us as well after promising to be there for us. My dad has 6 siblings and basically none of them reached out to check up after the first month and all of his ex-coworker friends began ignoring calls soon after too. It’s a lonely world when it comes to caring for someone with dementia and it opens your eyes as to who really cared about your loved one to begin with. 

Those same questions fill my own mind everyday. I understand how hard it must it be, especially since you live away from her as well and aren’t able to see her often. And your right, it’s not fair... not in the slightest. 

I know I’m a complete stranger but if you ever need to talk or vent, feel free to message me, I’m more than willing to listen. I’m so sorry.
Hey OP, do you mind if I ask what variant your mum has? My dads is 53 and was diagnosed with front temporal lobe semantic aphasia in 2019 and the decline sound very familiar. He was a very sociable intelligent guys who now can't string more than a few words together and we can repeat words back to him that he has just said and still won't understand. He does alot of the same stuff watches alot of TV and outside his daily routine isn't the mobile either. Semantic aphasia attacks communication first and the rest sort of follows I've stepped back from work in a major way to take care of him as my mum passed away the same year he was diagnosed. We've just recently taken his car away from him following an incident of him almost running me over in the driveway. 

It would be hard being so far away and I'm sorry the change is so drastic! I hope your get support along the way!
I'm very sorry to hear about this. Was she evaluated by a physician that is expert in dementia? If not ,I suggest focusing on making sure that everything possible was done to determine the diagnosis. A neurologist who is expert in dementia can make sure that all other possible causes are rule out, and give a clearer diagnosis regarding type of dementia and prognosis. If this has already been done then realize that many of the steps suggested here, like gum care, vitamins, etc. will not really help, but the doctor can clarify if you have any increased risk.

Dementia is horrible, especially when it affects younger people.
Gosh I feel this so so much. I’m in a similar boat however fortunately I live in the same city as my mother. 
I am so so sorry you are going through this. You are so brave & strong. It’s so hard to find people who understand/ are in a similar situation and can relate/ say the right thing. Even though usually there is no right thing to know. 
If there is anything i have learned from my mothers diagnosis and decline of early onset Alzheimer’s, it’s that support is so vital. I see you and your family don’t have a lot of familial support around you. I would recommend reaching out to support groups. This will obviously be really tricky if you’re on the other side of the world but perhaps your step father might be able to help out. In saying that, these also might prove to be quite useful for your step father. He sounds like an amazing person and it must be hard for him too. 
I hope you and your family find the support you need
my mom was 55 when she was diagnosed, and it was something i had feared would happen for a long time. Im very sorry about your mother and not knowing what to do is something I can relate to. I've tried to show her the same love she showed me as a kid and sometimes thats all we can do. Hopefully in the future this disease will finally be treatable or curable.
I think you should try to get her tested and diagnosed. If she resists, maybe you can contact her regular doctor and express your concerns. Maybe the doc can request she come in for a routine checkup or something, and then do some testing. There are different types of dementia, and other conditions that have similar symptoms, so it would be worthwhile to find out, and see if she needs treatment/medication.

I know it can be difficult to get someone to a doc if they are resistant. When my mom started having symptoms, she flatly refused to see a doc. After many discussions, she finally said she didn't want to go because ""I don't want to have brain surgery."" I assured her that surgery is not necessary for memory loss. (We always referred to it as memory loss, not Alzheimer's.)

Many months later, she called and told me she had seen a neurologist (!!!). I asked her what he said. She told me the neuro said it was dementia. She was very matter-of-fact about it, but she was probably just covering up her real feelings.

So at least we finally knew what we were dealing with, so we could start doing research and making plans.

And no, it's not fair. The best you can do is try to get her diagnosed so she can be treated. And keep her safe.",2022-01-15 09:24:06,TucsonTea,s4ldm7
Dementia,I think it's finally happening to my grandmother.,"This is a first for me because my grandmother, a woman who up until this year was so sharp and quick witted, is finally showing signs of....something. I highly suspect dementia. She's 82, will be 83 this year. 

It started last year a few months after my grandfather passed. My grandmother began seeing people in her house. She called my mother to tell her that there had been a family living in her house for 2 days before she finally pitched a fit and told them to leave. It was determined that she had a horrible, horrible UTI/bladder infection that the doctor said could cause delusions and hallucinations in elderly patients if left untreated for so long. 

Well, just a few nights ago she called 911 to report a break in. She said she saw 5 children in her house, all dressed in black, crouching with their faces to the wall as if to hide from her. As creepy as it is to me, she said she didn't feel afraid or like they were trying to harm her. Just more annoyed that one of these children sat in her flower pot.

She's had a hard time remembering current things and events, but can prattle off a memory from 50 years ago. 

This is all so New to me. I think my mother is in denial or is just having a hard time accepting what's coming. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. I guess I'm hoping for some advice or encouragement or insight. 

How do we approach these types of hallucinations? How do we preserve what could be the last few years of her life?","Teepa Snow videos on YouTube.
It sounds like that could be the case or another UTI. Could be both. 
 Definitely time to discuss the possibility with the doctor.
I highly recommend reading as many of the books referenced on this site as you can.  
I dealt with my father for 10 years with what I now know was Lewy body and a mother-in-law with Alzheimers for a few years before she was moved to a nursing home.
Then, 3 years ago, I saw signs of my wife beginning Alzheimers.   I was devastated but decided to really study these dementia diseases.   It has helped both my wife and my me to have a much happier time than my earlier experiences.  
 I feel guilty that I could have done much better with my father and mother-in-law if I had read the books before caring for them.",2022-01-14 23:20:23,DisastrousAnomaly,s4bn59
Dementia,I feel I'm not being told the truth,"Warning: Long post ahead! My grandma(my closest person in my life) has been living with dementia for the last 6 months. It started in a severe way but thankfully I found a good nurse that brought her back to being stable. She was in good spirits for the past couple of months and it became like a normal life. Until this week, she started to show trouble with breathing and it degrated rapidly. She couldn't eat properly, her speech declined so I took her to the emergency. Yesterday she tested positive and I thought that was it. 

But today, her doctor told me that she had no signs of COVID, wasn't infected in her lungs and she was going to be okay. Strange I thought. So I took her back home and called her nurse to spend time with her so I could rest a bit and called another doctor to check on her for at least a week. My grandma is using a ventilator and the doctor is going to give her the proper medicine. Both of them are very motivated to help her and served my grandma in a optimistical approach.

My problem is that I don't buy it. I feel I'm being lied so I won't get hurt. The nurse talked on the phone with a relative of mine and I grew suspicious. My mom has been texting me kind words, which isn't unusual but still. The doctor proposed to me rent the ventilator for at least 10 days and after that my grandma would become better by then. As of now my grandma responds rarely to my calls and barely utters anything. Her vision is slowly fading on each hour and hasn't slept properly. Nonetheless her oxygen level and her heartbeats are normal(I'm checking them every once in 30 minutes).

I don't like searching the internet for a medical condition, because I fully trust the doctors, but this time I feel like I'm being lied. As far as I've known, dementia never only gets worse with time and can cause lung failure or other damages. Probably wanted to know if anyone has ever had any experience with elders catching a cold/trouble breathing and then recovering from it or it is just downhill on each time people with dementia get sick or catch the flu? I only wish that my grandma becomes like she was a week ago because she was happy and I really don't mind not getting my name remembered.","Stay hopeful bit expect the worst, it really could go either way.
\- You seem to have a lot of adults (you, your mom, relative the nurse was talking to) involved in your grandmother's care. Is one of them the designated POA for your grandmother? If so that person will have the whole story. Ask. 

\- You have a lot of doctors and medical personnel involved. Are they communicating with each other? 

Yes, people with dementia can recover from a cold, COVID, the flu, etc. But their overall immune system may be more challenged for a variety of reasons, and the recovery may be much harder, just as it would be for any person with significant health challenges. 

All the best wishes. I hope your grandmother feels better soon.
Please also learn what is actually happening.  Is grandmother on a Cpap machine?  Highly unlikely she is on a ventilator. The terminology is important.",2022-01-14 21:51:27,Bejliii,s49yg1
Dementia,Dementia patients and their money. A question.,"Sorry so long, but dementia is just so complex as you guys probably know.

My dad is going to need to go to a nursing home soon, no question about that.  My mom's out of town and I'm by myself taking care of him which has become near impossible.  So I decide to finally go take a look at his financials to put together a budget for what inpatient care will cost if he ends up living another like, 10 years and also thinking about my mom's future.

My dad retired very wealthy but was a huge cheapskate.  He worked at the same company as a GM for forty years, and they matched his 401K from his first day there up to the day he retired.  I know this because the accountant from his company is my godmother.  So I went into the basement and got on his laptop to finally see just how much money he has (he kept it all on a spreadsheet that he never let any of us see.  He's always been paranoid about money being stolen from him.)  My mom pays all the bills with automatic pay i set up for her out of their checking account, (she doesn't know anything about finance above what's in this checking account where I have their social security direct deposited into).  The house was paid off long ago.

Went down to the basement, and I got into the spreadsheet by guessing the correct password for the laptop.  The only document on this mac was the ""secret"" spreadsheet.  I was so relieved, then immediately wasn't.   Apparently when he retired, he rolled his entire 401k into a single IRA, all of which was documented.  So far so good.  Then the bottom fell out.  

In 2014 he cashed out the entire IRA and his life savings and spread the entire amount into EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN TEN DIFFERENT CREDIT UNIONS.  He didn't list which credit unions, much less account numbers.  The credit unions were just numbered ""credit union 1-10"" and ""account 1-18"") with the amounts he deposited in each one.  And yes, he was loaded.   There are no paper statements anywhere, no receipts of deposit, no interest statements, and my mom says she's never seen any statements or even junk mail from any credit unions in the mail aside from their checking account.  He must have asked all of them to go paperless or something?   Not even a hint or locked document stating which banks he hid all his money in.   And make no mistake, he went out of his way to hide this money.   He has no memory of doing this, of course.  I went through every document in his file cabinet and the fireproof safe.  Nothing.

Him hiding his money, is that a dementia thing?  And finally, we are fucked, aren't we?","POA is critical.

If you can find tax returns, you’ll be further along the way.

It all sounds weird… but one thing I’ve learned is that for a lot of people dementia doesn’t start immediately. Looking back there was odd behavior for years before my dad was diagnosed, and some of the decisions were not the best- but they were the best he could do and we didn’t know he needed help.
An attorney that specializes in elder law can help you.  They will know how to find all the accounts.  They can also draw up the  paperwork to give you power of attorney over your dad’s finances (you should probably be your mom’s POA too).
Does your dad have a financial Power of Attorney? If so, who is it? Mom? Yourself? It's clear at this point that if he does have a POA, it's time to trigger it. I'm assuming you have documentation of his dementia from his physician. That is enough to trigger the POA. Most financial institutions will accept this document as approval that the POA can take financial control of the incapacitated adult's accounts. Some may require a court order, or a Guardianship, I but I would cross that bridge once you get to it.

Whoever is the POA needs to get in contact with each of those financial institutions, and come up with a plan to make it easier to manage his finances. 

My grandmother's situation wasn't nearly this complicated, but she did have accounts at 2 financial institutions. I consolidated all of her cash into one institution and closed her account at her other institution.
Just a thought, but he probably had the proceeds deposited directly from his retirement to these various accounts. Could you start there and work your way out to the different credit unions. It’s possible he sent it all to one bank account, so you would go back as far as 2014 to see where it went from that one account to the various smaller accounts.
Maybe that same attorney is your father’s registered agent and any bank statements or tax documents are sent to his office? Your sister will probably have to help you out on that though.
If he has enough 'capacity' for a lawyer to see him competent enough to sign a Power Of Attorney, that approach could give someone the capability and authority to survey the credit unions as to where his accounts are.  Else, you're looking at the tiresome  Public Trustee route, I think.

Surely they mail statements to him?  Perhaps he's rented a post office box (and/or a safety deposit box) somewhere (& his key would be a good clue).  Maybe there's a tax return copy that lists his banks (I'm in Canada so am clueless about US tax matters).
Review his tax statements from the year he cashed out to current year. Usually annual earnings will be documented.
surely those banks will need to send tax statements somewhere soon.  Email, an address or maybe  po box
My sympathies dementia money problems suck, my mom has a will, mandate for her property, but no POA, which is a big PITA.  

We had to hire a social worker to work with her doctor so we can hire some lawyers to take it to a judge to argue this person with supporting documents are to take over my mom's financial responsibilities.  It's going to take about a year or so. Working on it.

Best of luck,
Paranoia and dementia often go hand in hand.
It's frustrating, I know. 
Getting POA since your mom isn't really savvy on financial stuff would be a good start. See an elder care attorney. They should be able to help you locate the accounts since he likely had to use his SSN to set them up. You also might want to check his state's unclaimed funds website, if they haven't gotten any interaction from him for a certain amount of time it could be turned over to them.

Also, as a side note, I'm glad this thread is more helpful for you! :)
If these were savings accounts, OP’s dad will be getting 1099-INTs soon with their interest statements for last year, which the IRS requires be sent. They may be delivered digitally if paperless billing is turned on. You need to gain access to their email account. Good luck!",2022-01-14 14:55:27,McNasty420,s411h0
Dementia,"My nan has dementia really bad, had a heart attack and is being aggressive to hospital staff.","It never get easier to deal with someone who has dementia. Whether it's your loved one, a close friend, or your job it's never easy. 

A little back story: I use to work in a memory care unit for 10+ years. I love it. We were short staff or had crappy staff who wouldnt show up for the shift. So I would stay late or go in early. My normal shift was 9 hours long. I remember I went in 4 hours early to help out, worked my shift and then was asked to stay late. I had 20 hours in one day. I DIDNT MIND ONE BIT! I love my job. Everything about it but the toileting and death. Yes I was there alot when they were on the last moments. I was the one who was med trained to give low doses of morphine if it was needed. 

I quit once my grandma (nan) was diagnosed with it. Ever person I cared for I saw my nan and would break down crying.

Last night my father called (nan is his mom) and told me she is in the hospital right now because she had a heart attack and now the Drs suspect a blood clot somewhere in the chest. She is fighting nurses and drs. Pulling put ivs monitors etc. She is scared and doesn't understand. My 2 a I aunts ate there and My dad show be shortly.  My nan is 2 hours away and i can't get there because of a winter storm. (Ice snow and wind) 

I cry all night. Didn't sleep hardly at all because nan was on my mind. She needs me!!! She needs someone who can comfort her distract her from that chaos around her. Some one to be in her world and feel what she feels.  And I can't get to her. It's killing me. 

End of my venting session. Thank you for reading. I just want my nan.","This note will, of course, be of no help at all...

Know that there are others who have shared and understand your distress; that it is no fault of yours that Life prevents your being where you want to be caring for your Nan.

Your father and others will comfort and care for her. ...Of course not as well, you don't think, as you would. But she is not alone. There are people with her who care and are doing all they can that she is comfortable and not in pain.

May you and you Nan both find peace.
Test for UTI!!! it should be obvious to medical staff whenever an older lady acts out suddenly, but they don’t always test for it!!
My mom the first time she was hospitalized after her diagnosis had a really bad night of disorientation, hitting nurses, pulling out her IV, etc. She ended up in a special restraint chair and drugged out of her mind. I never knew anything until it was over because my sister was her POA and they called her to tell her. She decided I was too emotional and didn't pass the message on top me until morning.
Mom had called me the night before sounding scared because she was in a strange place. I talked to her for over an hour, helping her look around and see things that told her where she was. By the time we got off the phone she was laughing and telling me about quilting with my aunts and was tired and ready to go to sleep.I thought we'd dodged a bullet. I was so angry the next morning finding out my sister hadn't tried talking to her to get her calmed down and allowed her to be drugged and strapped down.

Hospital staff in general don't know how to deal with dementia patients.
Oh Sweetie!!  I will be praying for your Nan and for you!  What a precious soul you are!!!❤️🙏🏼
I’m so sorry you are going through this right now. 😢",2022-01-14 08:55:45,Super_Shawnda,s3sxy3
Dementia,Me and mom are tired of my dads crap.,"My dad was diagnosed with dementia 2-3 years ago and in those two years he has just gone down hill. He struggles to walk,  messes food when he eats, has problems with his bowels and incontinence. He is also EXTREMELY STUBBORN and refuses anything to make life easy for us. E.g wearing nappies...walking properly with his walker( he does not walk properly with it and just gets angry when we tell him he is walking wrong) refuses to admit he can see perfectly with his one eye..he has problems with his right eye and the doctor says he can see perfectly with his left eye...but he wont wear an eye patch to help him see better. HE NEVER LISTENS AND FALLS CONSTANTLY HE KNOWS HE CANNOT WALK PROPERLY.  HE NEVER LISTENS TO US. GETS FREAKED OUT ABOUT THE SMALLEST THINGS..KEEPS MY MOM AWAKE AT NIGHT BECAUSE HE STRUGGLES TO ROLL AND LIGHT A JOINT AND HE SMOKES MANY..he nearly lost it when his weed ran out. He is not senile...he is fully aware of who we are, who he is there is nothing wrong with his mind he just has trouble finding words sometimes and acts like he has no strength but when he is angry he can hurt us and grab our arms. He laughs when he falls and we get upset and shocked about it....he thinks its so funny.","Parts of your dad's brain are dead and dying. Remember that. Also people with dementia fake it. If they have any self awareness, they hide hide hide what they are missing. You may think he remembers you, but my FIL can have a conversation with a person, and has no clue who they hell the person is. It's an appropriate conversation too. You'd never know.

How much of this is your dad being a jerk,  how much of his brain is damaged and those functions aren't coming back, I don't know. My FIL has vascular dementia, and he can be a total monster on a bad day. Off the charts, and you'd think he has Lewy Body dementia. The next day he passes as normal. That's how shitty this disease is. When he is acting horrible he can't help it. It's his dying brain giving the wrong information. Like it's good to leave the house when it's-15F in your jammie pants.

It was explained to me that dementia is a library with books that has small bonfires going. It's not like a traumatic brain injury where everything at once is rubble. The books that tell us how to do this or that are burnt crispy. Once those books are burnt, that's it. The function will never come back. Sometimes the brain can boot strap around a loss, but sometimes you are just fucked.

You sound totally done. I get it. Mom is done. I get it. Dad at minimum sounds terrified and in denial/coping. It's awful to know your brain is failing,  experience a fail, and remember that fail.

I'm sure there are people will give you suggestions on contacting dad's neurologist, and letting the doctor know this isn't working anymore. 

I just wanted you to know that dementia is the worse when the person has some self-awareness. My FIL is about where you dad is. He seems okay, but nowhere near okay. He wasn't near Lake Okay the previous 4 years before he was diagnosed. He managed to hide it really well. That's heart breaking.

(hugs) I hope you can get the support services your family needs.
That was a beautiful response by Korora705, so simple and true and heartbreaking, there ya go.

I'm past your point OP, but not by much.  My Dad was forced into a home by the hospital so it made it a bit easier, but it's never easy.  I'm mostly to the point of acceptance now.

I'm so sorry.  I don't have any really good advice, just sympathy.  You're not alone.  I would tell my mother over and over that if Dad won't use the walker and falls, he falls.  He's not a small child that can managed, she cannot be held responsible for his actions.  There's spousal guilt that gets involved I think and mothering guilt too when the role of wife is switched to caregiver.

I hope things get better.  You're not alone, sending you some internet hugs and love.",2022-01-14 07:48:16,StudentTeacher278,s3rkqy
Dementia,Mom wandered for the first time last night,"I don't know if this is a vent or what but I just need to get it out!

Mom wandered for the first time last night. Thankfully, she didn't leave the house.

My step-dad told me that when he woke up this morning that all the lights in the house were on.  He didn't know until morning because he sleeps with a blindfold, and I slept through it. 

I'll buy a chain lock and install it up high on the door so she can't leave the house, but I really hate this.  This disease doesn't allow caretakers to catch a breath, it's always something.  

I'm exhausted. :(","Scary, I know! My mom recently walked out in the driveway in the middle of the night, then came back in (thankfully, it was cold out) We have a ring camera, which is how I realized it the next morning. I had been charging my phone in the living room, now I charge it in my bedroom with the sound ALL the way up. She hasn’t wandered out again, but I learned we have lots of deer in our neighborhood.
Our dad locked the screen door on his way outside in the dark and snow and polar vortex couple winters ago and we moved in. As his dementia progressed he would try to leave the house or go upstairs to his old bedroom, so we placed padlocks up high
Maybe get an alarm.  The night wandering is the WOOORST.
My mom wondered in the house, and that resulted in a fall and broken bones. So now we have a bed alarm. It goes off if she gets out of bed.
It’s so scary when it gets to this point. We used door alarms while she stayed with us, an overnight psw when she was in assisted living and finally had to move her to memory care in a secure ward. She exit seeks every single day.
I put these on all the doors. Put it on the highest volume. You won’t sleep through it

Dementia,Nursing Home,"I'm trying to place my husband in a nursing home. He got sick at 48 and it's been ten yrs. I'm going through so many feelings, I spent all my 40s taking care of him, I've missed out on job opportunities and properly raising two young boys. I'm stating over at 50 again, it's just hard accepting that this is where I'm at, I have to let go it hurts. Thanks for letting me vent again.","I’m sorry. This is something I know is in my future. I hope you will take the time to regain your life. You deserve it. Truly.
I work with people with dementia in long term care. There can still be a lot of good experiences left! 
       
The difference will be that now the time you spend with him can be focused on the positives, not worrying about safety or being burned out from all the care you've had to provide.
         
I'm not trying to say this is going to be an easy or painless transition, but it isn't the end.
I have have the same story, except I started trying to get a diagnosis for my wife in 2016 (then 55). If you don’t mind, I would be interested in your decision making process to place your husband into a home and what you are finding out there for nursing home options. She is currently deep in the middle stages and I still have my head in the sand.
My counselor said it best to me…. “The impossible will become possible again.”  That really helped me to focus that it is temporary and that I need to be sure to take care of myself, as well as my kids and husband.  I’m on the same path as you and am only 53.  I am glad my kids are in their early 20s, but we are all young still.  

You still have a lot of life ahead of you to make great memories from great experiences!  And don’t look at it as starting over…look at it as picking up where you left off….like getting ready to start again on a big huge painting that has the potential to be the best one you have ever painted….
I am so sorry you have been going through this for so long and it happened to him so young!  I started over at 50 when my husband died. I went back to school and got the job of my dreams.  You do it,  you still have years to live.
It's a really tough thing to do. The pain, guilt and worry that comes with having to put a loved one into care is horrendous. You've had a right good go of it trying to do it all yourself. It's too much and you need your life back. This will be good for both of you.
there will be magic again, you deserve it
The relationship between you and him, him and your sons, and you and your sons will become better for it.
I’m waiting for a diagnosis and one thing I will tell my husband is to put me in a home. I do not want him to loose out on life and become my full time career. I do worry about the financial burden, like it will take all of our savings. But your health comes first, you need to be healthy for you and your children

Dementia,"My Grandma (90) is accusing my Dad and Stepmom of abusing her finances, among other things..","After dealing with being confined in the house in fear of getting Covid, my grandma’s mental state has drastically declined. For as long as I can remember she has had issues with her memory i.e asking me the same question over and over in an hour, but she generally manages most everyday tasks on her own. She was living with my dad and stepmom who took care of her until they pleaded with her to go with them to the doctor for testing when things got really bad (to get a diagnosis and appropriate treatment/help) which made things worse causing her to reach out to her nephew for help, to where he intervened and took her to live with him. I often talk with her on the phone, she say’s they have been using her money for vacations and selling her things, trying to poison her food (that it was making her sick) and that she was generally living in fear with them. Today she told me she wants to put my Stepmom in jail and that she has contacted lawyers and is taking legal action to get her money back. She is telling everyone that they were abusing her. I know in my heart my Dad and step mom could never do something like that to their mother/MIL, and it is absolutely breaking my heart to see her do this to them.","I guarantee you she is not taking legal action, if her dementia is so advanced that she can’t remember what she asked you, and she’s been diagnosed with dementia by her doctor (I cant tell if she agreed to do that from your post), then she doesn’t have the capacity to make financial decisions for herself.

Her disease is causing her paranoia, and she isn’t the person she was before, who wouldn’t accuse her family of such things.

Your parents can get an elder law attorney to become her financial legal guardian, but honestly she’s with the nephew now, I think you just let it go and don’t feed into the delusion on the phone. Change the subject and redirect.
It's common theme. They always feel stolen and abused. When in fact dementia is their abuser. Their and everyone else around them
My dad is doing the exact same thing.  Its extremely common and anyone who knows anything about dementia knows this.  I would just understand its the disease talking and not really your grandma.

Have your parents gotten an elder law lawyer yet?  I doubt your parents will get in any trouble but I do think they need help in knowing what to do about your grandma in general.

Also, if your grandma once had a will where she was going to give her money to your mom but now might change it to the nephew instead, that might be something worth consulting a lawyer on.
A lot of communities in western civilization have 'assessment teams', who visit such people and determine what their care needs are along with their capabilities.  Perhaps your area has that sort of service to call upon.

(that said, elder abuse, especially financial, is extremely common)
Her thinking that her food is being poisoned, is her taste buds changing. Everything tastes bitter to her. Bitter = poison.
How many of you in here are dealing with a dementia patient that lived through the depression?  I've noticed that changes the scope of the dementia drastically.",2022-01-13 17:15:32,Lildoozle,s3b96u
Dementia,Ha Ha,"Watching Match Game '76 with my dad and he says, ""This is a rerun.""","LOL
Hilarious!

When I was a kid we watched nature programs, nova, english comedies like all creatures great and small, sometimes Great Performances. All programs like that.

Now my mom watches fat people getting surgeries and 90 day fiances and hoarders all day long. Not that she really watches tv, it just runs in the background all the time. At least she still enjoys sports on tv.
Yes it fucking is Dad.
DUDE, my dad has no memory of my 2 sisters, still thinks I live in Chicago, asks me every 10 minutes for the past week where my mom is and i keep telling him, can't remember what he ate for breakfast, has no memory of the previous day, and no concept of time.  But I put ""Blazing Saddles"" on the DVD player last night and he had EVERY WORD MEMORIZED.

Dementia,do you avoid talking about dementia with someone in the early stages,,"It really depends on the person. Is this person accepting of the diagnosis? Then early stages while they're still somewhat cognizant is a good time to discuss how they want things handled later. Making legal arrangements on good days, etc.

If it's someone who denies there's a problem, that's a whole different story. With them, treat them as normally as possible and never bring it up because it's not going to be anything but a bone of contention.
We didn't with our dad. By the time we figured it out, he was already down the road. He just said he couldn't remember things and wrote everything down. He was able to pay his bills and balance his checkbook. We did everything gradually, taking his car keys, garage door opener, his checkbook and he never noticed. We made him a set of ""keys"" and a wallet with 5 one dollar bills so he had money. When we moved in, we were just ""spending the night""
In the longer run, I'm not sure it makes a difference.  They won't remember discussing it. 

In the moment, it may either provoke comfort (Oh good, I'm not going nuts or being robbed), or provoke defensiveness (you think I'm crazy!  You're just gaslighting me to get my money!).  I don't think you can predict which response, and that response may change from day to day.  

It makes it a challenge when persuading our parents they can't live independently/drive/handle their own finances.  Because they think they're fine.  And even if you manage to convince them that they need help, it may not stick and tomorrow (or 10 minutes from now)  they insist they can still drive. 

So I guess you do what feels right in the moment.  When mom's upset that she missed an appointment, perhaps point out that memory loss might mean accepting some help with her appointments. When Dad's angry that his bills are out of control, offer to help getting things organized for him.
nope

I urge them to eat healthy (at least 8 servings of fruits and vegetables per day, strongly associated with a good outcome dementia-wise), and, work diligently at gum care (gum inflammation's an all too likely cause of dementia).

If they're keen on self-improvement, I suggest they drink some (100 ml?) concord grape juice each day \[tagging along France's low dementia population thought due to wine drinking\], and, sprinkle some turmeric (a bland, yellow spice) on their meals \[tagging along India's < 1/4 the rate of dementia of westerners, thought most likely due to their very frequent curry consumption\].
We avoid it with my MIL. She sometimes knows ""something"" isn't right, and she has a hard time figuring things out. She'll often say ""I just don't feel like myself. It feels like something is wrong."" She forgot how to read a wall clock, and was extremely distressed by it. She said ""I know it tells time but I can't figure this out. What's wrong with me?""

But if you mention anything about dementia or confusion, the rage comes out. ""I'M NOT CONFUSED ABOUT ANYTHING! I REMEMBER TOO MUCH! You're saying this to put me in a NUT HOUSE! STOP IT!"" We learned the word ""confusion"" is a huge trigger word. She curses and screams and becomes extremely agitated. 

And she forgets everything by the following morning, anyway. So mentioning dementia or confusion or memory issues is pointless in her case. It just makes everyone upset and by the morning she forgets it all, anyway, and we're back at square one.

So we change the subject, distract her, and yes, lie (lying is not always bad). ""Wall clocks can be hard to read sometimes. Here, look at your digital clock. It's easier."" ""You seem upset. Do you want to go for a drive with us and get a donut?"" (she always does). ""Carrie's out of town for work. She can't visit for a while."" etc. 

Anything to make her more comfortable and peaceful.
I would say no. Engaging in a positive way and encouraging, distracting or simply interacting is a human social need.
My mom often just talks, not really saying anything discernible, but I always try to treat it with the type of replies and respect I would have with anyone else.
We are social creatures and responsible communication is as vital as food or air.
It may be difficult, but please always try to meet the person where they are, even if it doesn’t make logical sense to you.
It means something to them. That’s just my two cents.
Edit: my mom is now in the later stages, but always tried to meet her wherever she was each step.She may forget or be in denial but my conscience is clear.
I also suggest bringing as much love, patience and gentleness as possible to each conversation.
You never know if it will help, if done in a loving manner. Often, i’ll cry after an exchange, but at least I know I’m trying.
It’s so difficult, Take care  :)
I did, he would cry or sometimes wake up screaming in the middle of the night but eventually he stopped. It's so hard.
For me, a guy at 57 with dementia slowly creeping in, I will tell you my personal journey. I was brought aware of it a couple years ago. Yes shocking news like a cancer diagnosis. In full denial though. As time passes there is a time of acceptance. Clearly not everyone does this in my spot. I actually denied it and tried doing things I did last year and wasn’t able to. THIS is/was important. Being told and facing it is so different. As time goes on I realize that I am slowly collecting grains of sand and will soon have a beach. I am okay with that only cause I have a great support system and who doesn’t love a beach ?
We didn't. We explained everything to him, with the help of two professionals. We told him what we expected, what could have happened. As it was early stages, he could get his own affairs in order and there was no room left for future family drama. He wanted to put tags in every jacket/bag he owned with possible contact information and address. He was a part of the process.

I'm sure we go through days where he forgets what dementia even is now, but the early days I'm sure it helped us. It also made our doctor visits easier as he is more easily convinced to go.
Talking to my mom about her diagnosis prompted her to stop all medical testing, change POA, and start talking poorly of her own kids to her siblings who are in denial, and cutting out the siblings who were helpful. She has an older brother who is now bed ridden with lewy bodies. Her mom and grandmother died of some form of dementia.  She was 1 petscan shy of diagnosis. I would avoid if you have any slightest feelings of hostility around it.
We tried talking to my grandmother about it but by the time we realized it was dementia, it was too late. She’d forget we even had the conversation before the next day. If I were you I’d do it while you can, just about a year and a half ago we started noticing minor symptoms. Now she’s bed ridden, she doesn’t know who we are, she has not bladder control, she can’t eat, she can’t talk at all, ect. To be honest with you though, In the end it doesn’t make much difference. If you need to talk to her about it so you can reason with her about taking her house keys, car keys, ect. Then that’s one thing, but at one point she won’t remember that she’s forgetting anything to begin with..I’m sorry, I understand the stress and worry that comes with having a family member with dementia. And I’m sorry I’m advance for what’s coming down the road with it. God bless x
Oh man, good luck. I work with a lot of elderly people with dementia. You mentioning that your grandma wasn’t aware of day and night is a big problem. I don’t think it really matters if you discuss it, she won’t remember later. But I hope you can make sure she’s safe. When they develop dementia, a lot of people aren’t able to take care of themselves appropriately: cleaning themselves, feeding themselves, drinking, etc. I’ve seen people do some really wacky things. I am glad she has you to face reality on her behalf.
I would want to know if I were her... she has the right to get her affairs in order,  and to let you know what she wants her future to look like.
It really depends on the person. My mum was in denial and so is my friend. I’m recognising something is wrong so I’ve booked an appointment to be checked out. I have had a discussion about dementia with my friend and she said she doesn’t want to know she has it. I say you will recognised in the early stages (like I do) but then eventually you won’t realise. She has caused so many errors and everyone is fed up of correcting them when we are so busy. But as we are saying we’ll give more training etc we are now bullies. She lives on her own so won’t have anyone to recognise this. Very sad, but if the person doesn’t want to admit something is wrong there is nothing we can do.",2022-01-13 15:58:05,foulblood,s39h88

I'll pass, but I hope they find some people that can help their study.
Filled this survey out. Hope I’m able to help.
Done!  There should be a ""3rd party (accountant) helps with all bills/investments/taxes/general finances, not me, not person with dementia"" part.
If you change any part, change the time when the survey is due. If The person with dementia requires a lot of care during the night, the caregiver might go back to sleep in the morning, so the 11:00 a.m. deadline will skew your results because you won't have as much feedback from the people who are absolutely exhausted from a rough night. It needs to be that people can have 24 hours to complete it or that the survey comes out at 7:00 p.m. instead of 7:00 a.m.",2022-01-12 18:17:21,cariegiving,s2jzah
Dementia,Thermostat and any other helpful tips appreciated,"I care for my grandmother 3 nights /4 days a week. She lives next door. She has a day time caretaker the rest of the time and stays with my uncle those nights.  Sometimes she seems the same she's been from 80 to 90. Other times , we deal with the classic things. She's very proud and stubborn and has been always so she covers the extent of it well. Anyway , when I moved back here she had gotten really codependent on my uncle and he has ways he likes to do things. The family drama over her care was endless and I got my head bit off more times than I can count. I'm dealing with a severe pain condition so I'd retreat back home and let it be.

4 months ago I had a spine stimulator put in. She took a fall the next day and was in rehab for months after a TBI . It's kind of a miracle it reabsorbed.We brought her home after with the caveat of she isn't going to be alone at all now so that's when I started staying. It can be hard to be the granddaughter doing it but my uncle lets me do things without micromanaging now. She has her good days and bad days and I'm not sure if the sullen withdrawn moments or the manic typical nana moments where she belittles me out of the blue are harder. I've tried avoiding known triggers and set up things accordingly. It's hard when it's her house - a point of pride. 

Anyway - today I'm off and her caretaker texts saying the heat is stuck . I go check it out.  The ac is on 70 and the heat is on 75. She had pushed a bunch of buttons and locked it out. It wasn't until recently that I was trusted my uncle to even deal with it bc he's had to have the guy out a lot and doesn't believe that I know how to work w dual thermostat 😂 exhausting. Anyway. The damage was done when I got there. I pulled the panel and the battery but it's wired with no way to disconnect. I checked the breakers but they aren't labeled. That would cause chaos. So now he's going to come lecture her or me and any time I breathe near the thermostat she's going to lose it. She fixates that it has to be on 75 and punched the wall. I've come in there plenty of the times where they were on the same temp. Ironically, it was 71 and she's been hot plenty .She sleeps better at 70 . 

Tldr-  Anyone know if they make like a fake panel magnet to go over the screen that reflects a different temp than it is . The thermostat arguments usually happen in the morning when my pain is super high and I'd like to just avoid the my house 75 argument  all together.","I don't know how to ""fix"" the readout, but I do know you need a ""Thermostat Guard"" [something like this](https://smile.amazon.com/Honeywell-CG512A-Thermostat-Guard-Clear/dp/B00KH6UPG6/ref=sr_1_4?crid=12G1XJLDURY9L&keywords=Thermostat+Guard+Clear&qid=1642027578&sprefix=thermostat+guard+clear%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-4)
I have a similar problem with my mother, except she likes to turn off the heat. Doesn't matter what time of year she'll turn it off. We live in a cold climate and right now it's - 25°, earlier this week it was as cold as -35°.  When she started doing this in the fall, I knew it I was going to have issues in the winter and put thermostat locks on.  She grumbled about it for a while, and focuses on whatever I'm cooking now and likes to come in and turn that off. So I have to watch the food now. Better than the pipes freezing I suppose.
Would a Nest work? My parents switched to one a few years ago. My mom doesn't recognize it as the thermostat and, even when she does realize that it shows the temperature, she has no idea how to re-set it. You can also set it to stay within certain boundaries, and adjust it as needed by app...
We put a plastic box over the thermostat with a lock on it.
In addition to the guard someone mentioned, you could install Ecobee or Google Nest thermostat.
I used to work in HVAC. You could re-route the tstat wire and tstat to somewhere else and leave the current tstat in its current location. It would continue to sense and display temperature but wouldn't do anything.
This will only work if it operates with batteries. If not, you would need a battery operated tstat.
\-(greatly reducing the impact of repeat occurences):  labelling the circuit breakers seems useful -- at least, pinning down which one runs the thermostat ( eg. pick a quiet time to shut them all off for a few minutes to see which one wakes up the thermostat and then red flag that one)

\-perhaps tape over the thermostat temperature display?  good sleep's important, a lower temperature does help with better sleep",2022-01-12 16:21:00,BionicWoahMan,s2hamg
Dementia,My dad (83 with mid/late stage dementia) and his ER visit. I don't even know where to start.,"I just found this sub.  A backstory (sorry so long, but I intend to be posting a lot on here).  We were a happy family of 5.  Three years ago, the head of my family, my brilliant older sister passed away at 48 from Breast Cancer.  My dad didn't go to the funeral, she lived out in Cupertino (we live down south) and he can't leave the house, let alone fly.  He had no memory of her by the time she passed anyway.  We just found out my 40 year old younger sister in Pennsylvania has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.  My dad has no memory of her either.  

My family is falling apart.  My mom is his caregiver, they've lived in the same house for their entire lives and he will die here, no plans to move him anywhere.  He weighs about 75 pounds, but he still eats meals and can use the bathroom,  and he can walk very very slowly in a shuffling manner.  But he is rapidly declining.   My mom left last week to go up north helping my sis through her 4th chemo round.   I am taking care of my dad here by myself, I packed a bag and just moved in as soon as my mom left (he can't be left alone).  I live an hour away and by some miracle,  he definitely knows who I am and always tells me how much he loves me and loves my cooking when he sees me, so that is a relief.  He knows who my mom is.  He asks me 20 times a day where my mom is.  I just say out of town.  I lie to him about everything, I don't want to confuse him.  He wanders around when it gets dark and I just lead him back up to bed.  No major drama at all.

Well a few evenings ago (before he started sundowning this night), it finally happened.  He fell walking to the bathroom.  Hard.  On his arm.  He lost control of his bowels, and started vomiting, unable to move but conscious.  I immediately called 911 and explained the situation.  I got my dad dressed on the floor and calmly explained to him an ambulance was coming but there is nothing to worry about.  I remained calm and told him I would be there the entire time holding his hand.  I showed him old photos of us together and he was smiling.   The paramedics showed up and I pretended to my dad that he was going on a fun excursion on a stretcher and he was totally at ease, everything was going smoothly.  Until it wasn't.  They said I couldn't ride in the ambulance or even follow them to the hospital because I wasn't vaccinated.  They said stay home and wait for the nurse to call when he got into a room.  I understand, even though I had my mask on.

2 hours hours later, the nurse calls to inform me he is in a room and she is about to give him the Covid vaccine while he's waiting for the doctor to examine him.  What.  The.  Fuck.  He hasn't left the house in 4 years, he weighs 70 pounds and was brought in on a 911.  I told her absolutely fucking not.  And if I find out they gave it to him, we were going to have a BIG problem.  He would never survive the side effects.  His blood doesn't even clot.  An hour goes by and the doctor calls.  Said he didn't have a concussion but fractured his arm, which the doc bandaged up.  They said he's ready to go home and is being discharged.  It was 10pm.  I asked where do I park and, which room he was in.  They said pull up to hospital entrance and he is SITTING OUTSIDE IN A WHEELCHAIR WAITING FOR ME TO PICK HIM UP.  It was a 45 minute drive.  He sat out there alone at 11pm strapped down to a wheelchair in the freezing cold with nothing but a small blanket.  He was terrified and belligerent and said his arm hurt really bad. 

  
 I pulled up, got out of my car and banged on the door of the waiting room.  I demanded to see this doctor.   This douche doctor comes out with his discharge folder.  I said why is he alone in the parking lot, and where is the prescription for pain meds for his arm.  Doctor says they ""do not give out prescriptions for opiates due to the potential for addiction.""  Holy fucking shit.  I said ""he's 83 and has no memory of how he even got here.  Give him some damn pain relief!""  Dr. just said no and didn't even help me load my dad into my car.  

Is it normal to throw a dementia patient out of the hospital, alone, in the cold, strapped down to a wheelchair late at night, while sundowning, without so much as an advil?!!  They literally kicked him out of the hospital, alone at night in the cold.   He had soiled himself again when I found him.  He was terrified.  I cleaned him up when we got home.

Is this about the fucking vaccine or do hospitals just not give two shits about the elderly?  Everything is fine now, he has no memory of it, but his arm is purple, he keeps asking what happened to his arm.  I've just been giving him advil with his breakfast and dinner.  He says he's not in pain so I stopped giving him the medicine.","I really think you should explore Hospice. We recently lost a parent to dementia and Hospice did an amazing job helping manage care plus providing additional resources.
*He hasn't left the house in 4 years*?   What the heck, why is that?...  Sounds not very good for his mental nor cognitive health.  So sad.   And the hospital an hour away from you yet you didn't go to wait nearby until the doc had seen him?  They really left him strapped in a wheelchair on the sidewalk at night for an hour?  

And it's odd that only anti-vaxxers know 'so many people' who were 'EXTREMELY ill' after the jab.  I personally know hundreds of people who got jabbed & only one had an inconvenient side-effect for a couple hours, many had minor discomforts for an hour or day or two.  And none of those peoples family or friends had any vaxx dramas either.  And I know more than half dozen un-jabbed folk who died from covid and many who have lasting disability from long-covid.  

6 or 7 million people dead from covid, hospitals overwhelmed by predominantly unvaxxed, but people still clinging to this 'vaCcine bAd' narrative.  Yes, there are consequences of being unvaxxed.
Not because of the vaccine, but probably because they had an ER full of covid patients.   He has been exposed, but would have been 100% guaranteed to get it if they had let him stay inside.   Not even near the right decision, but sounds like the hospital folks were exhausted (still no excuse).
[deleted]
We've been caring for my wife's 93 year old grandmother with dementia & she was fine after getting the vaccine. 

If he's eating regularly I'd get him vaccinated. especially since he'll be going to doctors more & more.

 As far as the opioids, the doctors don't just have toworry about your father abusing them, but the caretaker as well. The Doctor has no time to investigate you or the other members of the household that might have pushed your father inorder to get pain pills. Pharmaceutical company drug dealers & addicts ruined pain medication for us all. 

Get a hold of hospice care through Medicaid or Medicare they can help with nurses to come by & local charities can help with things like respite breaks for family care takers like your mom if you can't.
I work as a nurse on a dementia ward. We have 32 residents, all got vaccinated twice and nobody died from the vaccine. They had less problems than me. They were super fit and didn‘t even notice a sore arm or something. 
AND please take your dad out! just because he suffers from dementia doesn‘t mean you have to keep him in the house all day. 4 years? imagine what this does with your mind….
But I can also tell you that hospitals often care less about dementia patients. It‘s sad but true.
Hi. I have a 92-year-old MIL who is a major fall risk. She's been in and out of the hospital more times than I can count this year. The hospital protocols have changed and, quite frankly, the hospitals are overrun with patients and understaffed with COVID. 

On one of her hospital stays they had to cancel her booster appointment and refused to give it in the hospital. Instead, they wanted her transported out of the care facility, during the delta wave, to get the shot in the grocery store. We rescheduled. 

The last time we had her in after a fall she was basically treated in the ER waiting room along with a swath of other IV'd, coughing, patients. There were no rooms available. No partitions. No protections and arseholes walking around unmasked. They did a CT and we waited for hours and hours to learn she didn't have a concussion. She was there from before noon to well after midnight. We kept her by the door, far away from all the patients, on a very cold night.

I get the frustration but these are not normal circumstances. Everyone should do their part and get vax'd and stay masked if only to help ease the load on our medical facilities. Your dad is a perfect example of why.
Your story only re asserts my belief that medical care in the US is for profit and no one cares about the sick.

I'm sorry you had to go through it.
That sounds like a terrible experience, and it seems that this is below the standard of care you should expect. Every hospital has a complaints procedure, and they will at least tell you why they did this and what are the reasons behind it. 

If you are not happy with the outcome, you can also complain to the regular (depending on where you are). But if the hospital was really busy, that is probably a credible explanation. 

You should also consider whether care at home is still appropriate. Sometimes it works, but it is never easy.
I recommend checking out r/HermanCainAward. Everyone there thought they were also better off without the vaccine.
The vaccine is perfectly safe for someone of his age. And safe for someone of your age. If you had been vaccinated the whole situation would have been avoided.
It sounds like you are really worried about vaccine side effects but your dad is terminal, dementia is killing him and and it sounds like because of his weight, he is in failure to thrive. I recommend here weighing the balance of probabilities. Side effects are really just a sore arm, some fatigue and only some people get that. Extremely rare side effects are extraordinarily unlikely, but honestly, if he got a blood clot and died, would it be worse than him living like this? My mother in law is at the same stage and it’s really horrible to see and experience every day. I pray she passes peacefully in her sleep. 

You are going through a lot. I can sense your emotion in this post. I’m a healthcare professional and I believe in vaccinations but I also feel your father deserved better care than he received but we are also in times of such unprecedented case load that the hospital is just not going to prioritize a late stage dementia patient who is unvaccinated. I suggest just continuing what you are doing, providing pain relief and keeping him comfortable. With my mother in law, she gets extra strength Tylenols with breakfast, lunch and before bed time. She had multiple falls this summer and has a fractured shoulder and two torn rotator cuffs.
First: That was a horrible experience for everyone concerned--just, damn. I also hope your sister makes a complete recovery.

You and your family could get some additional support. When was the last time your dad saw his/a primary doctor? Primary doctors can make referrals to agencies and write prescriptions for medical equipment that may make life a little easier. 

Also, has your family considered hospice care? It's not a death sentence: it's about making the patient comfortable and supporting the family. From what you describe, I think he would qualify, and services are covered by federal funds in the US.
Sorry for your struggle, but you are the reason hospitals are being overwhelmed right now and cannot afford to provide the extra care to people who willfully disregard their own health and the health of others for selfish reasons based on unscientific Facebook misinformation. This is not an anti-vax sub. If you want to complain about being mistreated for your values take it somewhere else.
Get yourselves vaccinated.
Omgee your poor dad that is HORRIFIC they could have atleast left him in the waiting room or maybe they couldn’t cos he would have been at risk of getting covid. Still come on they could caused his death leaving him in a parking lot???? I know the hospitals are over run and understaffed but that DR sounded cold and uncaring for not giving him some pain relief on discharge opioids aren’t the only thing they could have prescribed. 

I’m so so sorry you went through that OP you both deserved better treatment. I’d complain that’s not okay especially for an elderly man
Best of luck OP with your dad.  For your own peace of mind, please disable replies to this thread and do not come back here. 

Unfortunately the topic of covid and vaccines are is split into two camps right now the right side or the other, its incredibly divisive and politicians, and bad actors are stoking the flames whipping the risk averse into a frenzy.  Here's what the leader of my country said this week about the unvaccinated  [“They don’t believe in science/progress and are very often misogynistic and racist. It’s a very small group of people, but that doesn’t shy away from the fact that they take up some space. “This leads us, as a leader and as a country, to make a choice: Do we tolerate these people? ""](https://westernstandardonline.com/2021/12/trudeau-calls-the-unvaccinated-racist-and-misogynistic-extremists/) 

I'm double vaccinated, but not getting the 3rd shot because since I'm young and healthy and finally got covid latest variant. No covid booster shots can beat natural immunity, so I'm done with it.  

Best wishes.",2022-01-12 03:57:19,McNasty420,s21rie
Dementia,Memory care facilities,"Anyone have luck getting their loved one into one of these facilities? I’ve been calling it seems unless they are hospitalized they don’t want to take them in.

I was trying to ballpark costs since she has no assets, her only income is SSI and she is covered through both Medical and Medicare but they don’t seem to want to engage unless she’s ready to go in at this moment. 

Anyone have any guidance or luck with this? I’m in Los Angeles if that helps.","Medicare does not pay for long term facility care such as Memory care. I don't know if California is different, but make sure she's been specifically approved for MediCal long term care and not just MediCal medical insurance. (In other states, they are 2 different programs.) And it varies per state whether MediCal (Medicaid) will cover Memory Care vs. a nursing facility. And not all facilities will accept a Medicaid patient and some that do will only do this after a certain period of time as private pay, such as a year. I do NOT recommend ""A Place for Mom"". They only refer you to places that have contracted with them to pay a referral fee. Good facilities don't need to pay referral fees to get business. Plus, why limit yourself to only a fraction of all facilities available?  So, you need to confirm exactly what kind of facility MediCal will pay for, confirm your Mom is approved, and then start researching facilities that take MediCal and get on waiting lists for the ones you like. Or, if she's not ready to move into one yet, at least create a list of your 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc. choices. Regarding facilities that will only take her if she's hospitalized they may be referring to the fact that Medicare will only pay for facility care if a patient requires rehab following a hospital stay of at least 3 days. Even then, they will only pay for the facility for up to 30 days assuming she continues to improve. This is not what you are looking for, so be clear that you are looking for long term care paid by MediCal.

P.S. In my area, costs are $7000-10,000/mo+.
Is there an office of the aging in your area? That’s where we started when looking into places for my grandmother. Also, it is A LOT easier to get them in somewhere after hospitalization, I’m not really sure why.
My MIL was put into memory care in FL. $3,650 a month. They accepted Medicare and Medicaid, which she qualifies for. It took about 6-7 months to go through the approval process. Medicaid pays $1,400 towards her care, but $2,250 per month is out of our pocket. 

Her memory care unit isn't the best, but it's about what we can afford. We decided not to move her to CA due to the cost.
Memory care in my area (Houston) was on the order of $6500-7000/mo.
I’m in the same situation. Exactly the same. I been calling medical, health net, and medicare. They keep giving me numbers to call. Today actually my sister got a hold of a number where a social worker will call us. We are going to wait to see what our next step is. We are waiting on a day care he is about to be admitted there for four hours a day. But the situation is bad now. My mom can’t take care of him anymore. Physical he is bigger and he doesn’t want to eat anymore. If I find someway. I will let you know. We are in L.a country too.
I get the sense that they place patients prioritized by urgency. So it feels “easier” to get a spot in memory care arranged by the caseworker, when discharged straight there directly from the hospital after an accident.
We went through a social worker to get dad into a facility after mom passed away. I live 1700 miles away and spent six months living with and caring for him until a spot opened up. The facility we got wasn't even on our list, but it turned out to be exactly what he needed. The facility is large enough to be a rural hospital, so it has an internal health plan that covers all of the costs with Medicare and what little money he had. It feels like we found a unicorn because he's improved so much under their care.
I used a place for mom and had a good experience. It’s like apartment finder, but for senior living. They found a great place for my grandparents, who are both in memory care together.
In California, MediCal will cover the cost of nursing homes but not I'm not sure about memory care.  This may be determined by the individual facilities.  

Your loved one needs to qualify for this level of care for MediCal to cover them - which isn't a high bar.  Get her on a wait list for a MediCal bed and contact an eldercare attorney for advice.  

http://www.canhr.org/factsheets/medi-cal\_fs/html/fs\_medcal\_overview.htm
Depending on where you live, Memory Care can be a long waitlist. Sometimes the best option is Assisted Living in a facility that transfers patients from their AL to their Memory Care unit. However most of these are private and don’t take federal payments. I hope you are able to find the care that is needed.
We moved my fil into an assisted living/memory care facility last week. We did not have any issues. Several were toured, we decided, they came out and did an assessment to determine his level of care. That was on a Friday. He moved in the following Thursday.",2022-01-11 19:24:45,TranceNNy,s1s5ra
Dementia,Color perceptions?,Hi! My mom has fairly severe memory loss and “possibly” very early stage Alzheimer’s. She’s still fairly functional but is definitely stumped by some unfamiliar/non routine tasks. Recently she’s been talking about how blue the daytime sky is - she brings it up frequently (as if it’s the first time she’s mentioned it) and the sky looks pretty much the same to me. She’s also fixated on the street lights as they are very orange (as opposed to white). Is this shift in her perception of color common?,"My spouse is in midstage alzheimers and I am amazed at how enhanced her hearing and vision has become. That plus the ""in the moment"" dimension of alzheimers has her constantly remarking about the beautiful skies and beautiful music. She qcan't stop dancing to the beats.
Helps make up for the other difficulties that come from lost memories.
My mom had observational color things.  She was constantly pointing out all the white cars she saw, saying how many more white ones there were than the rest of the cars.  She’s gone now but I get a kick when I see a whole bunch of white cars in the same area.
My mum often comments on the colours of the trees, or the grass, or the sky, or yeh, certain vehicles, all while we're driving.  She also often says 'that blue one' when it's green, and vice-versa, has a red/brown thing too.  Yep, something going on there.
This rings true for me with my wife. She’ll often comment on the blue sky (Arizona, it’s almost always blue) and the colors of leaves and flowers. Thanks, I’ll pay more attention to this, too.
We (living with dementia) can get easily overwhelmed with color, movement, sounds, etc.  There is no such thing as background noise.  Instead of enjoying ""big band"" music (we taught ballroom dance) i can now only enjoy acapella or solo instrumentals.  Many of us have problems with the blinking linghts.  Almost ALL of us have difficulty with more than one conversation going on in a room. 

Much of these sensory symptoms are dependent on which type of dementia she has.  (Almost all of us are diagnosed with Alzheimer's initially, then diagnosis is revised as time goes on.)  Many sensory experiences are ""larger than life"".  That symptom needs considered in everyday circumstances such as birthday or holiday environment, conversation, etc
This is interesting, my Mum said to me look what’s that green bird in the garden…. It was a UK Robin so brown and fawn with a red chest. It was in shadows but definitely not green

I also suspect there’s something else with the colours as she thought she had no toilet roll. It was in the holder white against white tiles",2022-01-11 17:14:08,butimfunny,s1p7v6
Dementia,Are your loved ones aware they have dementia?,"My mom's doctors have never directly told her she has dementia. They screen her regularly for it, and she knows she doesn't perform very well, but I don't think she knows she officially has dementia. I don't mention it either, because I don't want to upset her. But I'm also wondering if there's any benefit to knowing? Would it help her understand why she can't recall things etc? Or would it just be upsetting?","No point in trying to explain to them. My grandma knows ""something's wrong with [her] memory"" but beyond that I don't try to explain. I just tell her ""that happens to a lot of folks as they get older"" and move the conversation along.
No.  My mom thinks she's the same as she ever was, that she can live independently, that she can drive and manage her own finances.  When she brings up, for example, buying a car I simply ask her what kind of car she wants.  So we talk a while about Jeeps, or whatever car she likes that day.  By the time we've chatted about cars a bit she changes the subject and we're talking about something else.

We've told her she has dementia several times, but it makes no sense to her and she doesn't remember so we stopped talking about it.
My mother knows.  Maybe one benefit is that when she gets upset over things she can't remember, I tell her that she's not getting stupid.  She has a disease and it's not her fault.  For now that helps calm her down.  Even if that's not much benefit, I don't see that knowing has hurt her in any way.
No. My MIL doesn’t know, if she gets frustrated about memory or word recall, I just listen and validate that sometimes she has a hard time remembering. I’ve told her a couple of times, but she doesn’t stick with it. I also tell her that I know she’s trying really hard and doing her best. That really helps calm her.
My Grandma and Aunt had it so my Uncle was prepared legally pretty well. When he asks me what's wrong with him, I tell him the truth he takes it really well. I never lie to him.
we tried explaining it to her. she remembered the fact that we told her about it. And then integrated it into her worldview that everyone was gaslighting her like the Truman show (Capgras delusion) -.-

In the last month, she’s had two moments of self-awareness on it. One where she lamented that she frequently doesn’t know where she is, she doesn’t remember her kids names, and she doesn’t know why she’s here. She didn’t remember an entire 6-week stint in rehab after a hip break. The second one, she asked why she hadn’t heard from her parents in so long, and are they ok? When told they had passed decades ago, she wanted to know why she missed the funeral. when told that she did attend, everything was done appropriately… she cried for an hour upset because she “had never forgotten such a huge chunk of her life before” :(
Despite all her denials over the last 4+ years (and now she probably doesn’t  realize it), I still think my wife has more than an inkling of her condition and abilities. However, she totally refuses to see a dr for anything. So whether she knows or not is academic. But clearly it will take a crisis before she actually goes to a dr and gets a diagnosis. Until then, there’s nothing I can do, no services that can be used, and a wasted LTC policy. Just a shitty situation.
Dad is in the early/middle stages and on good days, he knows his brain isn't working like it should. He's had increasing short term memory loss for about a decade, but is still himself most of the time. He gets down on himself when he can't complete tasks that he knows he should be able to do - he used to love doing things on the computer or his Nook, but they befuddle him now. He knows he's in decline and we've all mentioned dementia, but labeling the problem just isn't important as long as we and the docs in the facility know.
My husband knows but he doesn’t really understand. He will hear about someone who has another health problem and comment on how lucky he is to be well.
My MIL was told but thinks she’s cured of it. Keeps telling us “remember when I had a touch of Alzheimer’s” like it’s a cold.
Yes, he says he has memory problem . That he inherited his mother's ""head illness""

He is conscious about it.
They say “my memory isn’t what it used to be”, but they can’t put a name to it or consider that it is illness or disability.
My mom ""knows"" she has dementia but, of course, doesn't believe it's true. She thinks my sister-in-law told the doctor she has it for some unknown reason and she believes everyone else has been bamboozled because we believe it. 

Personally, I hate when it comes up because it's an agitation spiral for my mom and it takes quite a few attempts to redirect the conversation to something pleasant. It could definitely do the same thing with your mom.  

I'm sorry you're dealing with this, OP. :(
I personally think if she still has some cognition it may be beneficial for her to know. This is because she will be able to come to terms with her diagnosis and maybe some things she is confused about will start coming to light. 
However, in saying that, this could cause more confusion or friction towards the disease. Is she going to gain anything by knowing? Will her knowing make it easier / harder for her to sign documents in whcih she signs away her rights & choices? It’s a bit if a catch 22.
I would say it is dependant on age and cognition. Good luck on your decision
... totally depends on how far along she is.  We (living with dementia symptoms) have support groupS in text, Zoom, etc.  i am very involved with ""Dementia Mentors"", but there is also ""Dementia Alliance International (much more into activism), and Zoom group discussions with Dementia Action Alliance (USA).  Being a retired nurse, if there is a confirmed cause for her dementia (Alzheimer's, Lewy Body, Vascular Dementia, Fronto-Temporal, etc) ... then being in a group with others who have the same type of dementia might be very nice for her, because she is likely to get into more of the technicalities for her specific type of dementia.

Dementia,My Mom's Caretaker is Older than Her!,"Guys, my mom is 70 and in state 5 of dementia. The health care agency just sent out a caretaker that is 74! What's wrong with this picture? The irony! T","Well...I'm 59, been a licensed nurse for 4 1/2 years, and the running gag is that they'll have me doing med passes in whatever nursing home I end up in. 😉

Seriously, I've provided care for patients close to my own age, and I find it very nice to have a client with a similar number of ""miles on the odometer"". Having someone with complementary life experiences makes the whole care experience that much easier for both sides. I hope your mom finds it so as well. 🤗
There are plenty of people who are 74 and still want to work, and are very able to do so.  And there are people who are able to work and need to do so because they can't survive on social security alone.

Now if you observe that the caregiver isn't strong enough to help your mother to the toilet, or not able to assist her with her meals or medication, that's a legit complaint.  But don't peg it to age in your complaint to the agency, that's discriminatory.
My Mom is 70 and we pay her friend who is 79 to help out three days a week.  She's amazing, not physically strong but mentally!  Very interesting how we age.
My mom is 72 it's really heartbreaking to see women much older enjoying their golden years to the fullest
Up until a fall last year, my MIL (92) was living alone, driving, mowing her lawn, carrying mulch...

Aging is different for everyone. There are very vibrant old folks around.
Sometimes if you don’t laugh, you’ll cry!! That’s life I guess.
I think looking after your mum probably really benefits the 74 year old - something to do & give meaning to someone’s life! I bet you your mother has also helped the carer open her eyes to just how lucky she is!",2022-01-11 14:36:16,beepbop21,s1lg7o

Dementia,Do you tell the patient they have Alzheimer’s or Dementia?,,"I’m finding it hard not to tell my FIL.  I have guardianship now to manage his finances and he doesn’t understand why we have control of his money and he doesn’t.  He doesn’t believe he has an issue and calls near about every day and goes to the bank multiple times a day almost all week long trying to figure out how to get his money back and why he doesn’t have money in the bank.  We tried to be gentle and explain guardianship.  Now we are being more upfront about the dementia and telling him why it is necessary and that we are with him while he deals with dementia and he isn’t alone.  He just feels like we are stealing from him and doing it to him not for him.  Depends on the day and time if the conversation goes ok or he hangs up mad and threatening that the relationship we have with him is ruined.  It is definitely a struggle for both sides especially when they don’t see they have a problem.
It depends on your role.

As a doctor, if they want to know, then yes.  Autonomy requires this information.  We don't hide bad news in any other domain: cancer, heart disease, deaths of loved ones.  The only reason we consider withholding this information in Alzheimer's disease is due to stigma.

As a family member or loved one, there's no point in confronting them with unpleasant facts.
IMO it depends. How long have they been diagnosed?  If they are still rational enough to understand what’s ahead and want to help the caregivers/loved ones  make the future as easy as possible (get affairs in order, move to assisted living/memory care, etc) for them, they could be told. 

My mom was a different story: 

Sibs and I told her several times that she had the beginnings of dementia to try and convince her she needed to go to a continuing care place she had decided upon several years before when she was healthy. Two of Her friends had already moved there and she wanted to be in the same place. But once she was dx’d her rational thought went out the window and she would become enraged and combative when the discussions started about moving and she absolutely refused to move.  Legally at the time, we couldn’t force her. Unfortunately she missed her window to move to her preferred place.  As she further declined, we did ultimately tell white lies as to why she needed to go to (a different) assisted living.
I talk about it a lot with my husband. It helps him understand what is happening to him.  I think it has allowed him to be less upset and frustrated at all of the things he can no longer do. He accepts it is part of the disease process.",2022-01-11 11:54:42,Puzzleheaded_Trip229,s1hj9g

Dementia,How do I help my mum who I believe has dementia (but refuses to acknowledge any issues),"i and my family think my mum (72) has some serious mental health issues, we think dementia is likely.
 
She is a lovely caring person; the sort of person you'd bring a friend home to and she would fuss over them and make sure everything is perfect.

In the last 2 years or so, she has changed, becoming fixated on odd topics (she watches hours of news everyday), become more moody and also very bitter. in the last week, she has been adamant it is the 28th of december, even tho my dad showed her a calender and tried to explain what day it was. she has had two arguements with people who were walking there dogs on the street past her house etc. it is so out of character. the problem is that she refuses to get help. my dad has asked her multiple times. i've mentioned it (in the guise of treating covid induced anxiety) and she told me my dad didn't want her seeing anyone. I’ve noticed these changes in the past couple of years, but it has swiftly accelerated in the past few months.

i guess my question is, what is the best way forward? how do we get her help? I have not yet sat her down for a ""serious"" conversation as my concern it
will antaganoise her. Any suggestions are much appreciated.","You basically need a diagnosis of some kind to move forward. Have your dad take her to a specialist, or mention it to their GP. You may need to consult several specialists as well: the first psychologist we had was entirely useless, but we found a geriatric psychiatrist who figured out my dad's condition pretty quick. 

It might be an early diagnosis, which gives you more time to get everything in order. You'll need your dad to start handling all the finances, keeping tabs on her spending, etc. Eventually your dad will need power of attorney to make decisions on her behalf. 

She likely won't like any of it and can lash out verbally, call you names, call you evil, etc. Just part of the nightmare that is them losing functionality and rationality. She needs the care even though she will resist and resent it. 

Stick with it. She's still in there, probably increasingly scared, confused, and disoriented. Show her you love her - but make sure to get her the help she needs.
Gosh, this sounds really challenging for your & your family.
Denial is so normal though - no one wants to know they’re losing it you know? 
It’s so hard to get someone help if they don’t want it or won’t acknowledge they need it. Good on you for doing your best to get her the help she needs.
I don’t have much advice that I’m sure you’ve not already tried but I’ll reiterate. Just keep trying to be understanding and empathetic, she’s going through confusing changes. And keep trying to have conversations with her about these changes & monitoring her reactions. 
Best of luck
I would try and have a word with your doctor and maybe tactfully just say ‘shall we see the doctor just to get your memory checked’. My Mum became aggressive, and the fact it is out of character
It took us about 3 years to get my mum to agree to a memory test. She has been diagnosed with vascular dementia, but still insists they are wrong.…. It’s strange, but since the diagnosis I’ve noticed her getting worse, and even more depressed. Maybe it was the wrong thing to do… but you don’t get any help and support without a diagnosis.
Appreciate all the responses. My dad has managed to get her in to see someone. Thanks everyone. I love that I can ask a question on the internet to a relatively small community and get so many helpful responses
Unfortunately for me and my mom (67), I raised concerns about her health and tried to urge  her to see a doctor for about 4 years. We had to schedule an appointment behind her back because she was losing so much weight, and so we used that as the focal point of the appointment instead of it being about her memory. It was a whole ordeal, giving the doctor warning about the situation, informing him on her refusal to seek care in the past, all this stuff we did behind the scenes, and we basically had to wait until we had an good opportunity to get her the care she needs. I don't know if this would have worked if she was more lucid, but the decline in the past 3 months has been more drastic than before so we had to work with that. They always say its better to get checked out sooner than later, but sometimes that's not always possible. Keep advocating - if she gets upset by the proposition, looking back it was better for me not to agitate it. Look for an opening and run with it if you can. The most you can do is speak up, you can't force anyone to receive care as much as we know they need it. In all my years of advocating, I know I did the best I could with the circumstances I was given.",2022-01-11 03:56:17,lukejackson3456731,s18lom
Dementia,I no longer the right person for this job.,"I wasn't the right person when she was first diagnosed.  And 3 years later, even more so.
What is the next step? I've been fighting with San Bernadino IHSS for over a year and can't get her a caregiver without a new hop to jump through just when I think we are close.
I have to work to keep a roof over our heads. 
And when I am home, it is a constant barrage of her yelling FUCK YOU at me or telling me just how awful I am to her or her cats. I feed her and the cats...it is far easier  to feed the cats. She goes through my belongings believing that I am hiding her random item of the day.

I can't stand being near her. I can't relax at work because I am worried all day. The cameras I have to check on her well being through the day ar a constant source of stress. 
Care facilities cost more nearly twice as much as I make. I am at wits end. And crying at work must surely be worrisome for my co-workers.
 I just can't do this anymore. I am ignoring my own chest pains, in hopes of it being ""the big one"".","Have you looked into what it would take for her to qualify for Medicaid (MediCal) long term care - specifically for facility care, not the medical insurance variety?  I'm not sure if this is your wife, mother, sister, etc. If she's your wife, I'd talk to an elder law attorney now because your assets are entwined with hers and the application needs to be done right in order to leave you with as much as possible. If she has too much income/assets to qualify, the elder law attorney can work with you on this as well.

[California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) Income & Asset Limits for Nursing Homes & Long Term Care](https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/medicaid-eligibility-california/)
In my case, I hired an elder care attorney to help me with the process. Step one (with my wife) was to put her in the nursing home. Once there, they cannot evict her as long as you are in the process of applying for Medicaid.  (Make sure you put her into a place that accepts Medicaid).  If you are in San Bernadino, CA I'm sure you can find some good elder care attorneys in your area. They will help you through the process.  Make sure you get one that will actually fill out all of the paperwork for you.
It is for my mother. I'll look into the long term care info...pretty sure I did already, but just incase. I'll do it when I get home. Thanks.
((Virtual Hug)) Dementia sucks

Fortunately, there were myself and 4 siblings, 4 of us retired, so we were able to care for our dad at home, 24/7 for 2 1/2 years. We looked into a memory care facility, and we would have to sell his home before he qualified for Medicaid, on top of his pension, social security and my mother's pension (he was intitled to 1/2 after she died). We made the decision to do it ourselves. Fortunately, his physician worked with us and helped us to find resources and some we found on our own. 

Daddy would sundown pretty bad and some nights would not sleep. He once stayed up for 3 days, then collapsed. His doctor prescribed a low dose anti-anxiety medication that was a life saver. I hope you can find resources to help 

Dementia sucks
Have you looked into an [adult day program](https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/adult-day-care)? The average rate in California comes in at $78 daily. So at least you can work without so much anxiety, and hopefully with more routine social contact, she'll be more tired by the evening?
I am helping my mother too , she is in the beginning stages. She got diagnosed with Covid today. Thankfully she’s triple
Vaxxed but we’ve had a roller coaster of emotions. My heart is with you and my prayers, we’re going to have to sell my childhood home to care for her. Which is fine, but Dementia is the cruelest thief.
In addition to the elder law attorney as others have suggested, you might want to talk to an elder care consultant to help with facility placement, Medi-Cal, legal referrals, and many other things that might come up. They do cost money, but are much cheaper than the lawyer - in my experience $170/hr vs $500/hr in Massachusetts, so you really want to save the lawyer for when they're specifically needed. As a team, part of what they should be doing is helping you and your mom save money in the long run. Those facilities will take every last penny if you let them.

Good luck.
I’m so sorry you’re going through this my mother’s not this bad but I can see it getting worse. I’m reading the answers to your question as help for me in the future it’s just too much to handle.
This is excellent advice from our friends on this subreddit.

Please don't ignore your chest pains.
Others have you covered with the legal side of things. She also needs help with her yelling at you. Talk with her doctor describe how she acts with you, and ask about anti-anxiety meds. You are in an area where medical marijuana is legal. Look into THC gummies or CBD gummies. They can help mellow her out.",2022-01-10 15:35:23,esillyamused,s0ttkw
Dementia,"Father-in-law has daily delusions of need to go to a vague appointment, presentation, meeting. Causing high levels of anxiety. What to do?","So my father-in-law had a heart valve replaced about 4 years ago, then another heart procedure a year later. His mental acuity has been declining ever since. When his cardiovascular docs are asked about this, they essentially say he's lucky to be alive and it is what it is.

Without going into exhaustive detail, he's having a hard-time with short-term memory and generally how things work, where things are, what he walked into a room for, etc etc. But the main source of stress for him and his caregiver (his wife, my mother-in-law) is his daily insistence that he has to go to some kind of important event.

The details are always a bit vague. It used to be a wedding. He would wake up every day thinking there was a wedding to go to. MIL would tell him there was no wedding and he would accept it and move on with the day. Sometimes he was more skeptical of there being no wedding, but it was more or less manageable.

Lately it has progressed to more difficult scenarios. Last month it was a fight of some type involving men on horses, and he needed to go intervene. Lately it's been an important presentation he needs to make, but he can't come up with the location or topic. The long and short of it is that he's having extreme anxiety about the need to physically go somewhere and do something that doesn't exist.

His anxiety and insistence about these imaginary problems has been getting worse over the past month or so. He is able-bodied, meaning it may get to the point that he needs to be physically stopped from leaving the house. MIL is at a loss about what to do, and I'm looking for any ideas. It's getting to the point that it's an all-day every day issue where he's constantly on the verge of a panic attack, which also has implications for stress on his heart.

I suppose they could seek some kind of anxiety medication? Playing along seems out of the question, as he has no concrete details on where these important events are taking place. So he can either be anxious and frustrated at home, or anxious and frustrated in the car or at some random location where these imaginary events are supposed to take place.

What can they do? Are there techniques for handling these kinds of delusions, either medicinal or otherwise? Looking for something that can ease the burden on MIL as well as stress for FIL.","I'm sorry that's a tough thing to go through. Medication is probably best if it is happening at all times of the day. Does he drive still? What worked best for me was agreeing that there was somewhere to go but it wasn't until later. I could then say, ""hey, are you going to have a shower and change?"", or something else as a redirection for the time being. It seems mean to ""lie"" but it's different because now it is about keeping your loved one comfortable. Could you have someone who's voice he wouldn't recognize call and say, ""Bob it's ok, don't come in today we have to postpone ""x"" until later""?
Anti anxiety medication helped my grandma a lot. Ask about Trazodone, there are finding it is helping dementia patients. Also for a quick fix you could just tell him they called and cancelled/asked to reschedule.
I know a woman who will fixate on non-existent doctor's appointments like these. Eventually I just made her as appointment cards and write the date as next week. Once she went to bed, I'd throw them out and make a new one the next time she fixated.

I agree that the biggest issue is letting him leave the house in this state. Honestly I would make templates in Canva for his typical events and reprint them with new dates every two weeks.
Anxiety meds, definitely. Also, if you don't already have them, door alarms and child safety locks, because if he's anything like my dad he'll get a bee in his bonnet and vanish the second you turn your back. Have you been able to identify any triggers? Examples: a random piece of junk mail he mistook for work correspondence, something he saw on TV, etc. I noticed delusions would also flare up if there was any deviation from his routine. It was almost as if his brain could only make any sense of the world as long as everything stayed the same, so if anything changed, his brain couldn't cope and just filled in all the blanks with random crazy shit. So keep an eye out for those deviations and try to avoid them as much as possible.

I feel for you. My dad had similar delusions and anxiety, and just as with yours, they were often so vague or inconsistent that we couldn't even ""play along"" to calm him down.  And, yeah, I've been down that road of trying to play along and take him some place...only for the whole delusion to change as soon as we got moving.

Sometimes it helped to reassure and redirect as others have suggested. Very often, though, he'd brush it off or accuse us of lying. Or, again, he'd switch to a different delusion. They were very, VERY sticky. Sometimes we could talk him down, but it could take hours. In the meantime, like your dad, he was able-bodied but severely cognitively impaired, so he both couldn't safely leave the house alone AND couldn't understand that.

So, definitely try anti-anxiety meds, or even CBD. Jot down notes and review them for possible triggers. And hang in there.
For my sister who had Alzheimer’s, she would get upset if I disagreed with her. When she believed she had to go to work, I told her she was on vacation. When she wanted to go home, sometimes I’d get her in the car and drive around the block. By the time we got back, she’d forgotten all about her former home.",2022-01-10 12:31:27,patrick_j,s0pglf
Dementia,Locking my bedroom door at night,"Hey all,

I commented on another post about sleep and it got me curious. Does anybody else feel really guilty locking their bedroom door at night? I've had incidents where either my mom would come into my room and freak me out, or somebody else would need help handling her. I dunno, maybe I'm just paranoid because I've woken up to use the bathroom and ran into her standing in front of the TV just staring blankly...honestly it creeps me out every time. Like one of the Paranormal Activity movies. 

I just wake up periodically and check the cameras in the house from my phone to see if she's wandering, but her neurologist gave her a new medication that helps her sleep 10hrs through the night so the incidents have nearly stopped. I still lock my door though.","I always lock my bedroom door for security as my dad can be violent. Also, if have found him in my room, moving/taking things like my wallet, passport etc.
I don't know if you are being paranoid or not, but either way I understand. My dad has anger episodes and has threatened my life (I don't live there, he told my brother this) and sometimes he has hallucinations that he's not home, but house sitting. I've also read on here enough times to know that he could start having hallucinations about people being in his house. I asked my brother (that lives there) to always lock his door when he's sleeping, just in case. And no, I don't feel bad about it, the mind is literally not right and if you've ever dealt with a dementia person during an illusion you understand this. Not sure this helps, buy you're not the only one.
I used to lock and put weights behind the door because my mom started throwing heavy objects and stab my door w/ scissors. I did not feel guilty because, unfortunately, the person out there was not my mom any more, just someone I’m responsible to help take care.
im a cna so i cant lock mine but this happened last night she was just standing over me at 3 am 😭
Reading these posts is going to give me nightmares. Don’t feel guilty for protecting yourself!
We lock our bedroom door. My Grandmother would randomly come bursting in freaking out. But now because her room is on the second floor and we have terrifying wooden stairs we have a tall baby gate at the end of her hallway with a chair. So she can wait until we can run up and help her down. Lock your door! Protect your space and mental health and I hope the meds work great for her.
We're locking all doors, except, of course, the bathroom. I usually feel guilty if I need to do this in front of my grandma, so I wait for her to at least look away or go to her room. If something is already locked and she's just trying to open that door every other minute, I don't feel guilty anymore because she obviously doesn't remember it's locked and definitely doesn't understand that it's because of her.
Ive locked my door befor my mom had was diagnosed with dementia, so no. The wandering drives erveryone nut but just think about waking up in a place you dont know and you alone in a 12 year old mind.

I would never wish this disease on anyone not even my worst enemy
Yes i did this all the time, she would barge in the middle of the night freaking the bejesus out of me! Other times she'd switch on the light thinking it was time for me to get up like I'm a kid again. 

I also locked all doors in the house to avoid anything she might throw away or ruin.
What med?
that’s not paranoia, that’s a rational trauma response
Do whatever makes you feel safe and most comfortable. You need to be taking care of yourself too
When I lock my door in her home she gets very angry. However, if I don’t, she will walk in while I’m showering, using the restroom, sleeping or just to pick a fight. Bottom line, I need privacy & set boundaries. She’s angry most of the time anyways so why should we both be put out *shrug*",2022-01-10 04:53:50,NinjaGrizzlyBear,s0ggjc
Dementia,MIL Up At Night,"Any advice for MIL getting up at night, waking up FIL, and both are exhausted the next day? It has been going on for a while. FIL is thinking of Nyquil or a Benadryl to try to break the cycle for MIL so they both can sleep.","Nyquil and Benadryl are no nos for dementia patients.  I would speak with her doctor about trying some appropriate sleep aides like trazodone or Remeron.
I would have FIL talk to MIL's doctor, as medications can work differently on those with dementia/Alzheimer's.
My mom used to be up around 2-3AM EVERY day and the general lack of rest was taking a toll on her. She'd get even more irrational, anxious, and irritable, and it would affect everybody in the house cause she'd be going about like it was 10AM (loud TV, doing the dishes, etc). It got to a point I had to install a lock on my bedroom door because she'd walk around like a zombie for the first hour or so and come into my room and I'd wake up and freak out. 

Her Neurologist prescribed her Quetiapine and it's a serious game changer. She takes it around 8:30PM and will sleep at least 10hrs straight. On top of that her mood is much better and she's more relaxed during the day. 

I still feel guilty locking my bedroom door at night but I've read some horror stories on here and it gives me peace of mind.
I feel for your FIL. I care for my mom and not having enough rest as a caregiver or dementia sufferer is ROUGH. Figuring out WHY she is waking up is important to solving it instead just using drugs to keep her asleep, I’d suggest.

I’ve struggled with this with my mom because she was falling asleep too early (late afternoon) then waking up at 1-2AM. So we started prioritizing staying up at least until 8PM. Also is she getting enough physical activity to be TIRED at bed time? Hard with cold weather and COVID, but even a short walk in the yard or a chair yoga routine from you tube can help.

I wonder if she’s getting up because she needs to pee. Maybe limit fluids after before bed or make sure she uses the rest room right before bed.

If you are thinking to try meds I’d discuss with her Dr but maybe consider something like melatonin that is specifically a sleep aid vs NyQuil or Benadryl that have a lot of drugs in them for other problems (congestion, cough, etc) 

Def try to help them figure it out. Sleep is so important for her AND FIL! Best wishes!
I had a horrible period of not being able to sleep. Tried everything, nothing worked. Finally tried liquid CBD, that stuff knocked me out completely and I'd wake up the next day feeling amazing
My mom has started having nights like that. The dr prescribed Seroquel. From what I’ve read, a lot of dementia patients take it. Her first dose was last night and as of 5 am she is still sleeping soundly.
We’ve done the following to help my mom…. In the morning open up the house and turn on the lights.  Make it DAYTIME.  Try to make sure she has adequate stimulation all day.  After dinner we start closing up the house, give her a melatonin at about 7:30 PM, start turning off lights, etc.  Limit fluids after dinner.  By her bedtime (10-10:30 PM) the house is dark and we are all talking about bedtime.  It helps, but doesn’t solve the problem
I give my wife half a .5mg alprazolam (Xanax) pill each night and that keeps her asleep all night, usually. I give it to her around 730-8 as it takes 1-2 hrs to interact. It’s basically an anti-anxiety, but I’ve only used them occasionally for better sleep.  I had a prescription from my doc and then got her one from her doc.
Something that could help at night is to have a night light in the room - on her side of the bed. A low level dim light helps when people with dementia wake up in the middle of the night. They wake up often disoriented and having a dim light will help them to recognize their surroundings easier. My stepfather wakes up a lot during the night as well and a lot of times he is hungry/thirsty. I would suggest maybe keeping a bottle of water or glass of water bedside or on FIL side of the bed so she can have a sip or two when she wakes up. As other people have mentioned keeping a routine at night will help a lot. Crossing my fingers that it gets better and your MIL and FIL can get more sleep!
Benadryl and NyQuil are two of many anticholinergic medications that can cause “permanent cognitive issues” even when taken for only a short time so I’d ask her doctor for a different medication.",2022-01-09 20:27:06,HaroldBAZ,s07c8i
Dementia,I Miss You,,,2022-01-09 06:13:07,Oxey_Existential,rzphr4
Dementia,Am I the bad guy?,"My father, 71, has vascular dementia as well as mini strokes. This is in addition to CKD Stage 4, end stage renal, hypertension, type 1. Just to name a few of the issues. 

Normally he’s good w feeding himself, but he’s not allowed to use the stove or oven as he once almost burnt the house down by leaving a grilled cheese on the stove for an hour… which cost us over $3500 to repair, clothing himself (although he hides dirty underwear which I don’t understand) and taking his meds as given to him. We used to leave them out in the little pill slots but he started taking them wrong and hiding them around the house so we have to physically watch him take them. 

My wife and I (only child) were allowing him to still have his financial independence because it wasn’t proving to be much of an issue. That was until last month where he cancelled all his credit cards (because someone stole them to pay for his meds, spoiler, they weren’t stolen and he made the payment from his phone) and he went almost $800 in the hole in his checking acct. leaving him w no money for almost 3 weeks. He then wrote bad checks to make payments which all bounced. Including the check he gave his grandson (my son) which bounced and fucked us over w our bank. 

This previous Monday, we were at his PCP office and I spoke privately w the doctor about what’s been happening and he advised me it was time to exercise my POA and take over. Oddly enough, later that evening he was admitted to the ER for pneumonia. 

So we took the time having him out of the house to remove everything. Cards, check books, everything. (He lives w my wife, our 1 yo son and myself.) 

So of course he came home last night and was upset. Saying that we’re his jailers and we’re working w his doctors to hold him hostage and not let him have a life. Now of course, w dementia, that’s not true at all. We sacrifice a lot for him, including me going from the breadwinner to being a SAHD so I can care for him full time. 

He says he pays his bills on time, but he doesn’t. We have this from his accounts and credit reports. So we took the necessary steps to exercise our POA and a letter of mental incapacity  provided by his PCP to take over all the accounts. 

Tonight, he was blowing up phones of my aunts (his sisters) continuously for hours to get them to tell me he doesn’t have dementia. Spoiler alert, they all know he does and are on our side. 

Then he called 911 and said we were holding him hostage. Thankfully I know many of the officers in my small rural town and they know the situation as he has wondered off before when I’ve been showering or ran to the store on a small trip (30-60 mins). They did come but told him there was nothing they could do unless he wanted to go back to the hospital. Of course he declined. 

So the next best thing we could do was turn off his phone through the provider and change the Wi-Fi passwords. Otherwise he will just keep calling my aunts all night and 911. 

Am I the asshole here? Cause I feel like I am. My wife reassures me I’m not as she has dealt w this before with her late grandmother. But I still feel guilty. I’m just trying to protect him from himself. He tells people I want to steal his money but he has none. He couldn’t even afford to buy himself a new bed so we paid for it for him. He has no savings. No 401k. Other than his pension and SS which are roughly 4K a month and cover his healthcare expenses, he has Jack shit. 

I just, feel like a POS. And she tells me all the time my dad is verbally and mentally abusing me yet I’m still here. I still want to care for him because no one else will.  And I don’t want to see him go into a home. 

I’m just so Fucking lost. 

I hate this shit.","You are not the bad guy. There are no bad guys here. There’s just dementia and it is evil.
My dad has vascular dementia, with daily mini strokes, Parkinson’s and a whole heap of other health problems. He regularly accuses us of putting him there against his will (he took part in the decision), believes he isn’t sick enough to need care, thinks we’ve stolen his money (he didn’t have any savings), claims we never visit (we visit him 2-3 times a week, including taking him out weekly)… the list goes on. Paranoia is part of the disease, and not being able to trust your own memories must be terrifying, so it’s easier to lash out and blame others. Dementia makes us the arseholes, that’s just fact. I try to respond with compassion and gently talk him through his fears, or just listen and reassure him that we love him and are doing our best to look after him, but it’s not always easy. In good moments, the accusations aren’t there and he is able to tell us he loves us. I hold onto those. Be gentle with yourself because you’re doing your best. They become like toddlers having a tantrum, so lots of deep breaths and try not to take it to heart. And be compassionate with yourself.
You're not the bad guy. The hardest thing is doing what we know is right for them. Just keep reminding yourself, it's not him, it's the disease.

Dementia sucks
I applaud you and your wife for taking care of your dad. Our dad passed from dementia in June. Dad liked to play the lottery so he had cash, but we had to drive him….until we found out he was giving out $$ to drug addicts. He had given him his phone number so they would call to make sure he was home alone. I took the checkbook, gave another to my brother and had all bills sent to his house. 
It’s going to be a challenge, keep his primary close, ours gave us low dose Ativan to use mostly at night because dad would sundown really bad
Dementia sucks
You are not a bad guy, actually consider yourself and your wife the unsong heroes in the history. You are doing things the best you can. He can't rationalize things anymore.

You can only keep him calm and avoid triggers that upset him (easier said than done).

The most you can do is talk to the doctor to adjust medication to calm him down, but with his condition (similar to my mother in law) he can get another mini stroke any moment and go down hill pretty fast, which happened to us.

Don't beat yourself up you are doing a great job.
NTBG (not the Bad Guy). Your dad has many similarities with my mom in the areas of finances and phone use.

 I don’t know if these will be helpful, but it’s what helped me get my mom’s finances and phone use under control: 1) True Link credit card, prepaid card that looks like traditional credit card, you have full control over everything. Made for seniors. Can block purchases, set limits, etc. 2) TeleCalm. Plug it in it to the internet, and plug in a traditional phone. You have complete control over incoming and outgoing calls. And it limits redials over a user-defined period of time, so he can’t drive everyone crazy. 

You’re doing a great job with shitty circumstances. Hang in there.
Vascular dementia is particularly difficult in my opinion, because the patient remains aware of so many things for so long. In comparison Alzheimer patients often aren't aware of their problems, because they forget much more of the small stuff. 

I feel for both you and your dad. You are trying to take care of him, and he can't see it, and therefore can't be grateful. It can help to make an external bad guy, even if he's fake. In the senior facility we tend to put the blame on 'the board' or 'the director' because that person will never actually have anything to do with their care. This helps to be able to agree with the patient, and to tell them 'you'll ask again' instead of you having to be the person who says no. 'The bank says' 'the law says' etc. Don't involve doctors and nurses, or other caretakers, as that will make your life much more difficult. Keep it distant. 

And it's no longer important what the real truth is. Your fathers truth is that he does stuff perfectly, and yet he is limited in what he's allowed. That is super frustrating ofcourse, and he'll never see your side of it. Try to roll with it, you already know better than him.
My mother was VERY abrasive and abusive before she finally had to go into a home. I couldn't do it. I am not that person. We have a history and I am human. 

I suspect they changed her meds to get her under control in the home, but now she is just a shell of shat she was. She can barely feed herself now. 

I am sorry you and your family are going through this. It is the worst! I wish you all the best as you make your way through this hellish situation.
Hang in there.  This disease steals one’s memories, judgement and personalities.  It is so hard.
Many times have I had to slam my foot down with not only my demented father but also his siblings that he can't be trusted with a phone anymore. if I let him have his way then he'll be calling the police and fire department over every little delusion or paranoia. I'm his full time care taker so they can always call me if they wanna talk but otherwise I am not dealing with that stressor. Trust me when I say it's the right call.
You are a good son. No one can take that from you. 

Your dads life here on earth is drawing to a close, and he is not happy about this fact. Understandably so, as not one of us really KNOWS what comes next. Losing one’s independence must SUCK.
OP, I totally feel for you. My mother felt and still feels the same way. When she was going through some acute cognitive decline earlier this year, she believed she was going to work  in person every day and handling all business as it should've been.

However, she was not going to work anymore. She had been a remote worker pre-pandemic and slipped into such a state where she would even forget to log onto her computer to go to work.   


Later on, I discovered she had spent money from insurance on home repairs as if it were her own. She used her the money to pay off her regular credit card spending. (At the time, we both paid the bills and I wasn't as involved until I realized she had dementia and had to take over.)

  
Your father seems like he's in the stage where things don't feel fair because he's got a decent amount of cognition but not enough to fend for himself independently, which is where my mom is at, too.

**Please consider maintaining a good quality of life for yourself. It sounds like your wife and immediate family are supportive and understanding of your decision. It's very noble of you to give up being a breadwinner for him. However, I would caution you to make sure you're not sacrificing your own family's future for your father's present.**

Since you say you're a SAHD, and not a WAHD, I'm assuming you don't work. Please evaluate carefully how that decision might impact your son's future (i.e. paying for college, technical school, etc.). Since your wife still works, is she contributing to a retirement account on your behalf? In the USA, she could contribute to an IRA in your name so you would have something for retirement.

Dementia is one hell of a journey. I'm very proud of you and all your love and sacrifice. We're all in this together.
Your job is to keep him comfortable..
How does dialysis go?
You are not the bad guy at all! You are doing good, and the things you experience is very common.  
If you can, try to distract him more, and say less ""no"" to you dad.
My Dad is 79 and I haven't seen him since December 2008 in Miami. He's a Cuban bipolar sociopath. So he's the bad guy and if he would have treated me good or didn't belittle me in my early 20s I wouldn't have self medicated. I was caught in the middle of him my Step Mom and 2 younger half Sisters. My Step Mom is from Vienna, Austria and she's tough. We talked and thought maybe it would be better if he was an alcoholic or smoked pot.
Remember your dad isn't your dad anymore. Parts of his brain are dying. When the parts die so does a little bit of him.

You have to remember your dad isn't making rational, conscious decisions to make your life can living hell. He doesn't wake up in the morning, figuring out how to best be obnoxious and hateful.

His brain is a jumble of delusions, hallucinations (?), faulty memories and probably terror if he has any self awareness left.

When he ramps up the crazy, smooth it over like you are dealing with a young child. A two-year-old doesn't see the big picture. Neither does your dad. He may talk a good game, but he's unable to now.

Redirection and agreeing are your best tools right now. Agreeing is white lies. ""My car won't start."" (you pulled the spark plugs) ""Oh, well call AAA tomorrow.""  ""You are staving me."" (you are cooking dinner for him) ""Would you like some McDonalds...whatever. Give me 30 mins "" My FIL won't remember my conversation from 30 mins ago. He'll sit down for dinner. 😆

There are no bad guys here. If your dad had any self-awareness, he probably wouldn't act this way. If he was acting ""normal"", you wouldn't be all up in his stuff.

(hugs)
This sounds SO similar to my experience … please remember this isn’t your dad taking shit, it’s the disease … I felt exactly like you do … after mom died, dad went off the deep end and dementia hit him hard as well … just love him and do your best to care for him, keep him occupied with brain teaser tasks … simple crosswords, puzzles, little jobs so he feels fulfillment … it’s a tough road to travel, don’t let this disease win … sadly, we had to put dad in a home because we simply couldn’t take care of him 24/7 and his health issues needed professional attendance … you’re only human
Not the asshole. The hardest and greatest display of love is when we  must take the reins to protect our loved one from themselves, knowing they will be angry.

Cold hard truths about their capacity feel like a bucket of ice water to them. Telling white lies to DELAY action on every demand will be your technique here. Or even just coming up with a reason he can't do something RIGHT NOW. (it's Sunday, it's after 4pm so the bank is closed, I called and left a message, it's in the mail, the mail is delayed...) 

Even better if you can use an excuse that gets backed up by current events if they watch the news. God knows how many things I've blamed things recently on the ""supply chain disruption"" 😬
Since he has functionally no money, you will want to get him qualified for Medicaid and on a waitlist for a Medicaid bed at a facility.  OR at the very least get him qualified for home aide services. https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/

So that you can at least return to work remotely. Or even be [paid by Medicaid or another state program to care for him](https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/paid-caregiver/elderly parents)

The fact that he has few assets makes it simpler. [click](https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/how-medicaid-counts-income/) and scroll down to ""What if one exceeds the income limit?"" 
You said he gets $4k monthly but he basically just covers his own medical expenses. Keep records of all that!!!! Paying medical expenses actually counts, dropping his countable income so that he may qualify already. See a [chart of income limits by state](https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/medicaid-eligibility-income-chart/)
No your not it’s a heartbreaking thing to go through with both of you just try and have patience/compassion for him and yourself
I guess the kidney disease also affects his cognition, man, that sucks beyond belief :( 

You’re not a POS, you’re doing what you have to do to protect your dad, who’s not in a position to help himself. 

You can’t take what he says the way you would anyone else, he’s a victim of his illnesses unfortunately. 

> And she tells me all the time my dad is verbally and mentally abusing me yet I’m still here

Your wife does? Idk. It’s hard for me to see what’s happening as abuse - at least at this point in his life - when it’s clearly a question of the dementia. 

Sounds like you and your wife might benefit from some support and education (especially your wife) in his disease. Interpreting his behaviour as intentional is not a path you should go down. It’s not. Seeing it that way will lead to resentment and that’s not good for anyone here
You're not the bad guy, it's just a really shit position to fnd yourself in.

It's a scary place for ytour father too - all you can do, is do the right thing.

X
You’re not the butthead here.  Dad is just fighting to maintain control of his life.  Going through the same thing.  Figured out there’s no sense arguing with someone who doesn’t remember.  Sometimes it’s best to give them time and space and they will calm down.  Even if they pack their things twice a week!  This keeps them feeling in control.  There’s good days and bad days.  Keep your head up!
No mate you are another unsung everyday hero coping with things most would have given up long ago.. Stay strong... Try to for your child and wife, they are also so very affected and real heros too..

As for your father, it's not him, it's dementia, but still, IT'S HARD MAN... You, me , noone's alone, try to keep strong man and best wishes for you all..",2022-01-09 00:28:05,svtf0525,rzke96
Dementia,My favorite cake,"My grandma used to be an amazing cook and baker.  
She suffers from dementia and isn’t able to cook, or even make her own coffee anymore.  
Despite her condition, every time she sees me she asks what can she cook for me. When I tell her that I’m fine, she insists. Comically enough, when I sometimes accept her offer (just for laughs) she would say something along the lines of “just let me know how to make it, and I’ll do it for you!”.   

Before every birthday she would ask me which cake I would like, in addition to her usual gift.   
She always told me that I shared her sweet-tooth, and would in fact bake two cakes. One for the birthday party itself to be shared with all of the guests, and one just for me- so I could continue enjoying it for days.   
My favorite cake by far was her amazing banana cake. No one in the family is able to recreate her recipe, despite our best efforts.   

iPhones have this feature that every so often it would make a small montage of a few random pictures of videos. Today a six years old video popped up. The video showed my mom and grandma working in the kitchen, and when my grandma looked up at the camera she said “working on your birthday cakes!”.   

I just can’t believe how far she has changed in such a short time. She is still loving and funny, but honestly, it’s not the same person.  

This dieses is awful. I believe that we have the best of it because we were able to get her a full time caretaker, and have her live just next door. It’s still unbelievably difficult seeing her bewildered  and confused eyes every so often. I just miss my grandma.","I’m sorry 😞 I know it’s not the same but here is an internet cake 🎂 along with some internet hugs
((hugs))

Dementia sucks. We were full time caregiver for our dad, my 4 siblings and I, for 2 1/2 years in his home. I too am glad I have lots of pictures and videos, as do my siblings, of our dad to keep forever.

Demetia sucks

Daddy didn't remember much toward the end, but he knew there was a ""national holiday"" coming, his 90th birthday. We bundled him up and had tee shirts made and had a drive by celebration for him, gave out cupcakes and ink pens. He was a good sport for 45 minutes.

We had cake and ice cream later. His birthday was May 6, he died June 6th

Dementia sucks

edit to update
I’m sorry!!! This is very relatable. My granny would say things like this all the time, too, right down to baking everyone a birthday cake. As they grow older they never stop being moms/grandmas and just want to be sure you’re taken care of, despite their inability to care for themselves. My granny is in a facility now due to needing a higher level of care but when I visit now she is so delighted to have company. Even though it can be so hard to look into her beautiful sweet face and see those blank eyes, I always want her to feel as loved and as special as she made us feel by celebrating us when we were small :-) she’s never going to be the same person again, unfortunately. But you’ll still catch glimpses of her personality so please hold out for those! I once had someone tell me “that isn’t your grandparent anymore”; i felt they were wrong. She’s always going to be my granny. As for your grandma, she’s doing her best, and I’m sure she feels your love :-) thank you for sharing. It’s not easy loving someone with this disease.
Grandmas and birthday cakes are wonderful things. 

Not sure from your post if you have lost the recipe (and can describe it) or just need guidance on replicating the results for banana cake, but you might ping /r/Old_Recipies \-- they've worked miracles before.
This disease dose suck! Can you make the cake together? You can do some prep, pre measure and Grandma can mix and help pour into the pan. Hopefully create a great memory for you both❤️
She can feel the love and support you are giving her ❤. She sounds like she was and is an amazing woman.
Many hugs to you. I know what it's like to lose someone you love in that way. With my grandmother, the special recipe was her rhubarb cobbler. She ran a hunting and fishing resort in the mountains for 40 years. We only got to visit in the summer but I counted the years until I was tall enough for baking lessons at that kitchen counter at the lodge.

Banana cakes and rhubarb cobbler for forever!
She loves you, and her love language is cooking (as it was for my grandmother).  i might suggest that you just crave a Peanut Butter and Jam sandwich  ((but BEFORE you suggest it, make sure those ingredients are out and available with appropriate knife for smoothing ingredients on the bread, or you might be surprised at what gets substituted !  ))",2022-01-08 05:25:25,KvotheOfTheHill,ryww4l
Dementia,Infinite patience,"... that's all I wish for you, as someone taking care of or even just regularly visiting someone with dementia.

Been thinking about this a lot lately.

Infinite patience.  Not a lot to ask for, right?

* ... when they can only come up with 10-20% of what they're trying to say, and you have no idea where they're going so you can't help them, and they're getting frustrated and looking at you like you're the dummy for not knowing what they mean.

* ... for the many times you've had to tell them that no, so-and-so can't visit because they died ten years ago.

* ... for the many times (you've learned) that you've had to tell a ""little white lie"" that's easier for them and easier for you, so-and-so can't visit because they're ""traveling on business""... and you were brought up, by this very person, not to lie, but now you're  learning that it's much, much easier to lie in this case, while hoping you're not picking up a really bad habit.

* ... for the times you have to shut down the prejudice and racism and hatefulness that you certainly never ever heard from them when they were in their right mind, and sure they're not in their right mind any more but that nastiness had to come from SOMEwhere.

* ... for the many times you wish they'd just go away (to put it politely), and yes, we were always taught that it's not nice to wish that, and yes, we know it's not their ""fault"" at all that they're like this... but it's all so damned tiring.

* For the family and relatives who don't ""get it"", and think that they know better, and that you're exaggerating how far gone the person is, and why don't you take them out more often (not realizing how much of a D-Day-type expedition it is to go to the mall).

* For it just not ending.

* Until it does, and you wonder if you could have done more.

* And you vow, privately, that you'll never end up in that situation because you wouldn't want to do that to anyone else and, less pleasantly, you wouldn't want anyone thinking about you the way you're thinking about this person.

*Sorry, folks.  I didn't mean this to get quite as dark as it did.  I really do wish you all infinite patience, or the closest thing to it PLUS the recognition that there's no such thing and we all have limits.  Take care of yourself and be well/well-ish...*","It was perfect.
D-day type expedition- yes!  Even going to a doctor appointment.  When she would visit my house, the minute she got there she wanted to go home (her assisted living place).  Any change in her surroundings freaked her out. 

My mother’s out of state relatives (a typical 8 hour car drive) were always suggesting I or one of my siblings drive my mom up to see them.  They didn’t seem to  understand why we couldn’t make this happen and asked just about every time there was an important family gathering that we bring my mom. 

Flying wasn’t an option even when she was mobile because she would not have been able to follow the rules and she would have been disruptive, possibly kicked off the plane.  Plus her incontinence would have had us going to the bathroom every 10 minutes even if she didn’t have to go.  And then what to do if she pooped her pants? It was always a huge mess when she did this and the bathrooms are so tiny on a jet. 

Driving her would have taken 12 hours or more with frequent stops and schlepping a very heavy wheelchair (eventually mom couldn’t walk at all). I physically could not lift her, and lifting the wheelchair just about broke my back. My sibs couldn’t get away for long trips so their help would not have been available. 

I sometimes got the vibe that my relatives thought I should make a trip with Mom even though I explained how difficult it would have been.

Mom passed away in early November and I still question if I did everything right. For almost 12 years I did the best I could but I still think I could/should have done more.  

Thank you for sharing your thoughts- they represent all of us who have cared for a parent, grandparent or spouse.
I feel seen. Thank you.
Well spake. Thank you for voicing some of our thoughts.
This is great - I wouldn't call it dark at all. Very realistic. Thanks for the post.
I wish I could give you so many awards for this post but I can’t afford it right now..

I feel this so hard.. I want to share this with my husband but I don’t know how he will take it right now.. 

I am the full time caregiver to my FIL and I feel this every day/night.. and because of his situation, I have had to homeschool our child for the last two years while nurses and PT’s come thru and all he does is yell at me if I try to get him to do PT..

In the last year and a half, I leave the house on an average of every six weeks.. 

We have NO help at all and the son with POA never shows up or pays a dime out of Pops’ S.S. for ANYTHING..

Sorry for the rant but sometimes it feels good.. 

Thank you and hugs to everyone!!
Your wisdom and insight resonates with me. So perfectly put. The emotional pain, frustration disbelief, sadness and heartache that this disease creates is beyond measure. 
My mother of 95 years just died in November. She lived with dementia for 5 years. Once a vibrant, bright independent woman just became a shell of herself. I miss her so very much, but honestly I lost her soul 3 years ago. Heartbroken that she is gone, but relieved in that she is no longer living in a body in mind that she herself no longer knew.
Thank-you. My Mum has been living with us the last six months and I am her caregiver. She wants to move back to her home and gets upset and angry at her life and independence been taken off her.
She doesn't (nor does the family who don't see her that often) that she is sick, even though her doctor has assessed she cannot live alone anymore and needs full-time care.
I am the bad guy, I am controlling her, she hates it here. It's just awful, but she will only go to a rest home when it's not an option anymore with me and we aren't there yet.
I have to sell her home soon, I am trying to include her, but she forgets conversations and decisions already made in the last six months even though she was included.
I have now got to the point of ""therapeutic lying"" just to save her the stress.
I miss my Mum, this new person is stressed, angry, paranoid and irrational.
Your post validated that what I'm experiencing is exactly what Alzheimers is doing to her and I am doing the best I can.
I feel heard, thank you
I love this post
My dad is going down this very path you've described (thanks to covid > literally everything else where I live I can't see any doctors for the time being), this is literally the hardest thing that I've ever experienced in my life. I'd rather have those kidney stones that I had 2 years ago instead of this happening.
No reason to apologize. Everyone reading this understands and agrees. This is likely the most stress we will ever have in our lives and the dark thoughts always creep in, surrounded by overwhelming gilt. My mom died over 5 years ago and I still have the guilt that I didn’t do more. Now I’m going through it with my dad.
You spoke the truth. Our dad died June 5th at 90. Siblings and I took care of him the last 2 1/2 years, in his home. There is nothing worse than ""the nobody is home"" look. He went on hospice 04/28/21. The last week was challenging, but we would do it all over again in a heartbeat. We decided we did not want him in a home. We would have had to sell everything he worked a lifetime to build up.

Dementia sucks
OMG...I have had these feelings everyday for the last 3 years! I love my mom more than life but this...all of this!!
Today was trying I lost my patience my husband was highly focused on a piece of cake. To the exclusion of everything. Nice to read this sub. His daughter is coming to visit soon some respite for me
Thank you so much for voicing my thoughts. This is one of the moment where I wish that I could be more articulate but oh well.....

Living with dementia sucks for everyone involved. I wish you all infinite patience :)
Thank you for this understanding post. Definitely helps me feel like I’m not the only one feeling these emotions",2022-01-07 20:43:43,magnabonzo,ryo45k
Dementia,Renewing the newspaper,"Venting. My dad insists on renewing his subscription to the local newspaper, but it’s now $1100 a year. He won’t read their online version, but will read other news headlines on his phone. He primarily wants the paper to read the comics and cut out the crossword puzzle, despite have clipped about 100 of them, and having puzzle books. I’m all about supporting local businesses, but spending $1100 to read old news is infuriating to me.","My advice is keep it. There is a certain normalcy to a daily paper. My mother keeps it nearby to keep track of what day it is, and to feel normal. It's really important to her, more now than when she actually read it.
As a former journalist, I'm biased, but I say keep it. If he's like my mom, he doesn't have the ability to read an entire book, and if he's always been up on current events the newspaper -- even if it's just the headlines -- makes him feel normal. Plus, I'm thrilled that I can call my mom and talk about what she read in today's newspaper!
I know how frustrating it is. My dad pays for Hulu Live, Netflix, prime, hbomax, even though all he watches is cable, which he pays $265 a month for. AND for some reason he also pays for three different wifi networks. Cancelling any of it sets him off into a rage and just isn't worth it. Big hugs!
I think it would be good for him to keep it.  

But just be aware of some publications and continue to monitor what your dad subscribes to. My Mom kept renewing a magazine multiple times a year. She would get the reminders every month (so sneaky of those publishers) and forget she had already mailed one in, or pull the inserts out and mail those in. I successfully canceled a few extra subscriptions for her but one slipped through the cracks and she got the quarterly magazine for about four years because the company said they couldn’t cancel it due to the time elapsed. Jerks. She passed in November and this company keeps sending reminders (I get her mail). Still jerks.
Call the newspaper and push for a lower rate. I’m in Southern California and pay for a year in one upfront payment of about $300.
I agree with everyone else--if he/you can afford it, keep it for now. It's quite possible he could fill the void with something much, much worse (my dad fell for all kinds of romance scammers).

It...won't last forever. Choose your battles--this one is probably not worth fighting.

That said...I will forever carry a huge grudge for those stupid cable companies who sell elderly people who don't watch sports and don't have tablets a package subscription to both to the tune of $350/mo.
When my Mom still lived at home she did the EXACT same thing.  She cut out all the crosswords too!!  I kept it for her for all the reasons already mentioned but boy was it frustrating paying for it.  I called to see if they could lower it and nope.  Kept the damn cable too...
We kept the newspaper for my dad. He used it to say what the day and date was. He ""read"" it out of habit with his coffee at $40 a month
Maybe you can get a discount if you talk to the carrier directly. Have them drop a day old paper that’s leftover from the previous day.
My Dad (the non-dementia parent who is starting to slip and it's scaring the beejeesus out of me) just renewed his at over $700/year. It's a local rag that has zero credibility and lousy writing. He complains a couple of times a week that he hates it and he wants to cancel and get his money back. But then he doesn't - and continues to read it. 

It's a ridiculous sum of money for what I agree is old news - but it's his deal. He's lost control over so much in his life with my mother going to Memory Care and his declining ability to do things without help that I just stay out of it. Sometimes he just needs something to complain about because his life just isn't fair anymore. 

I guess what I'm saying is - is this a battle worth fighting? If it's a financial concern, then definitely press the issue.
$1100  a year??  How much is it at the local grocery store... mine is a dollar or a dollar fifty on Sundays so you'd save around $600 bucks if yours is similar.
Do you have a neighbor or friend who might share their paper after they are done?  I save all of my LA Times and People magazine and pass them to an elderly neighbor when I am done.  Usually I am done with the paper before 10 am so she gets it reasonably early.  The neighbor is an older lady on a fixed income so I don’t ask her to contribute - I’d be buying it anyway.
My dad won’t try to read anything. I wish I could get him to exercise his brain. He says it’s too hard.
> to read old news 

Does your retired father really need news up to the second! His life was watching the local and national news on TV after dinner or in the morning paper. My phone gives me constant alerts for news. Does he really need that? Do any of us?
I vote to keep the subscription. I know it’s a steep price, but it’s an activity that brings him a routine, happiness and a predictable part of his day.
Is there no way of posting on a local social media group of your local area see if a local boy/girl fancy earning a few quid each morning before school to drop off a paper. Your dad doesn't need to know how it arrive.
Round my way a couple of kids got their mum to post to ask people if there anyone would like paper or small groceries delivery
$1100 seems excessive. Consider negotiating. Maybe you can get the public library to hand you all their old copies lol
Thank you everyone for your feedback and suggestions. I’m going to try getting him the digital subscription so he can read it on his iPad. If he hates it, I’ll suck it up and find the money for the print subscription",2022-01-06 18:51:16,UtherPenDragqueen,rxsoy7
Dementia,Things I'll need for end of life care?,"My father has gone downhill this week, and I'm preparing for his end of life care (he lives with us). I'm talking with his doctor today, who will give me a hospice referral. I know what hospice covers here, because I went through this with my stepmom almost 3 years ago. I'll take advantage of what they offer, but I'm also making sure I have everything I need to keep him comfortable. He's very close to bedbound now, is now completely incontinent, and is refusing food and isn't drinking as much water.

So far, here's what's on my list:

Hospital gowns for easy dressing and cleaning  
Lemon glycerin mouth swabs for dry mouth  
Warm hospital socks  
Adult diapers that open and close on the sides  
Disposable bed pads  
Extra sheets and pillows for turning and positioning  
Nature's Miracle Urine Destroyer (this is great stuff when dealing with soiled bedsheets and clothing)  
Rinse free bathing wipes  
Baby wipes

He has warm robes, and we have lots of extra blankets and a radiant space heater to keep him warm, plus a boombox to play his favorite music. I'll ask hospice for a hospital bed, mainly to protect my back.

Is there anything else that can help him or help us care for him during this time?

Edit to add: Oh my goodness, thank you so much for all your answers, and I'm so glad I asked! I've taken notes and added to my order. I'll discuss some of the suggestions with his doctor and hospice. I know I'm going to appreciate having all these things at hand when he or I need them!","Dressings etc should he develop bed sores - you’re a kind thoughtful daughter I hope this time goes as best as these things ever could 🙏🏼
Tissues; an abundant supply of towels; nitrile gloves. Oxygen, as appropriate, with long tubing (compressors are noisy). A suction device if he's prone to dysphagia and does want to eat/drink. 

A Bible or other religious text if he'd like to hear Psalm 23 or other texts read aloud. A phone charger & bluetooth headset, as people tend to call when you're in the middle of something. 

Clorox and/or disposable antibacterial wipes, less for him than for you. Lots of trash big bags, and preferably a can or something to hold them open while you pitch one-handed. 

A bell to tie onto his bed, which he can use as a call button, and which will ring if he shifts position while you're taking a breather or in the bathroom. Food and drink supplies for you. 

Don't know about medications, but perhaps a pill crusher or mortar/pestle and no-needle syringe, in case he can't swallow and you need to administer palliative meds—I found I had to compound with a little water and drip into open mouth toward the end (couldn't swallow). Paper & pencil to record meds dosing, times. Urinal if appropriate. Small basins for spitting, holding water while you sponge, etc. 

Did this for my dad a few years ago. Hair-raising, and beautiful. My heart goes out to you. ❤️
I just wanted to say that my prayers and thoughts are with you and your family. Even as a nurse who has worked in long term care/palliative care for so long it never gets any easier. Wishing you much strength and love during this time.

You did mention mouth swabs but also lip balm will be very helpful - a little vaseline in the corners of the lips as the corners tend to crack.I would also pick up some barrier cream as the skin will breakdown much more quickly when someone is incontinent - I typically put a little each time I perform peri-care. There are a lot of options and I am not sure where you are located but Cavilon by 3m is good, so is baza II by coloplast or their critic-aid clear, calmoseptine - If possible a thinner barrier cream just for protection from breakdown instead of a sudocrem or thicker type - I say that because the thicker creams tend to be more challenging to wipe away gently and can sometimes cause more irritation if used for several days.

I am sure this will be done but I am just adding it in case - a subcutaneous port for medications/pain medication specifically (dilaudid or morphine or if they choose something else) - the ports are a Godsend because it allows easy no needle access so your dad is not poked 75939 times to be given pain relief. The other commenters have really done an amazing job of listing all of the things you may need -

 I just wanted to add my little piece. I also want to add to please allow yourself some time for yourself/family as well. I know it seems unimportant at the time because you are caring for your father and you are focused on his needs - but please allow yourself a little time to care for you as well.
Just want to say you are a strong and amazing person and this list is so thoughtful. Also if your dad is still eating, ice cream :)
Many things mentioned were covered by our hospice, barrier cream, pads for bed sores, mouth swabs…  Check with them before you buy a lot. I also had pads/sheets to help turn my mother and one of those body pillows for repositioning.",2022-01-06 09:21:30,somuchmt,rxfp5z
Dementia,That Time I Bought My Mom the Blueberries She Asked For...,Can I just vent? So Mama is in stage 5 dementia. She can still use the bathroom and amble around and warm up stuff in the microwave and is under the impression that she no longer needs to take baths or change clothes. I asked her what she wanted me to bring her to eat and she told me she wanted a cheeseburger and some blueberries (she's always loved them). She inhales the burger and says that the berries are the devil and must be thrown away! She grabs the whole container and dumps them in the trash right then! She tells me she wanted strawberries instead! She scared off the newest nurse the Home Health Care agency sent. She fought the CNA who was helping wipe dirt off her face. This is my life now. I've used more PTO at work in the last few months than I've used in almost 20 years. How do you all keep yourselves together? I'm not married but I'm an only child so there is nobody to share the duties. I just needed to vent because I have nobody who understands. My mom is only 70yo. Most of my friends' moms still drive and remember great details of things. What happened to my poor mom? She deserved to enjoy her retirement years.,"It’s such an evil disease and I’m sorry you are having to deal with this alone.  My mom disappeared as the disease progressed.  Truthfully I think that softened the blow of her passing. I had already mourned many times over as she changed and wasn’t “Mom” anymore. 

Is your mom on any medications? The cocktail of anti anxiety meds helped my mom (she did once in a while have bouts of combativeness, but overall she was calmer). It may take a few weeks/months to find the right combo. 

Before mom moved to a memory care unit, it was a battle Royale to get her to bathe/shower.  The only thing that sometimes worked to convince her was to tell her she really smelled bad and I told her that her friends noticed it, too.  The social pressure aspect got her motivated (she didn’t care what I thought but if “her friends” did, she’d clean up).   Not wanting to bathe and other hygiene lapses are some of the many dementia behavior symptoms. 

Best of luck to you.
I'm so sorry you're going through this! I remember 'way 'way back thinking how awful it is to drug up older people, but oh my goodness, my dad's genius doctor hit exactly the right combo for him. His anxiety and aggressiveness greatly improved, increasing the quality of all our lives. He also managed to scare off all help before that.

I was super fortunate that during the pandemic, my work offered me the option of permanently working remotely. While my coworkers always had their kids or pets interrupting their meetings, I had my dad poking his head in saying, ""Can I get something to eat?"" (He has frontotemporal dementia, which made him eat constantly. I did up trays for him with healthy-ish snacks, but of course they'd always run out during meetings.)

We're entering the end stages now, and I think I'm going to use up my sick days and vacation because his care needs have increased so much.

I hope you're able to get out on your own, or maybe get respite care for your mom so you can recharge! It can be so hard some days...lately, I've just been resorting to ugly-crying in the bathroom.
This reminds me of my grandma. All Christmas week she’d throw away food. 🤦🏽‍♀️
I am similar. Dad is a single man and I am his only child. I hope that you'll eventually be able to find the right care for her when you can. I've had a lot of time off this year, and actually it's been really helpful. I hope you have a forgiving employer and will be able to make it through.

I find it just disappointing and sad that my dad won't grow into one of those fascinating old musicians with lots of wonderful stories about the 60s. Instead he's mostly alone in a boring box on the outskirts of town.

Good luck and feel free to reach out with a message if you need.

Edit: just for clarification, I am self-employed, so I have taken the time off on my own head!
Before my mom went into the hospital this was her. She'd ask for something and then decide she didn't want it or miraculously she was full. She never wants to shower because she's always cold. Even in the rehab she won't shower. Some days she likes the food there, some days she eats a box of graham crackers. I've also used a good chunk of my sick time going back and forth. I'm sorry you have to do this alone.
My mom is stage 4 alz and gets confused very easily. She will exaggerate conversations and make up memories that never happened. It’s very hard to realize your parent is just a person, but then for that person to need your care is another level of difficult.
I know you love your mom so dearly and are doing all you can for her. Please ask her primary care for resources. And I know it may not be what you want to hear, but you may need to put Mom in a home. Taking so much PTO isn't a sustainable solution.

I'm an only child as well, and I have a similar struggle with my own mom. (Saddest part is that I've only been in the workforce for a little over a year now as I recently graduated college.) My grandmother (mom's mom, who doesn't have dementia) told me to make sure I worked so that I could provide a good retirement for myself.

The only other compromise would be for you to get a work-from-home job like I have. (I work from home mostly because I prefer it but partially because I needed to be in the house with my mom. She is prone to falls.) Try searching Indeed or Flexjobs for remote work.

Sending you lots of hugs!
I totally get the shower thing. My dad always believes he takes a shower every morning (but doesn't) and one time my mom asked him to and he got upset and said that she didn't trust him and suddenly said he wanted a divorce. This was never mentioned before at all and even today he shows that he loves her, which definitely made us surprised when he said that. 

Totally okay to vent! We're all here to listen and support 🥰
Fuck, I'm so sorry. My grandfather was finally admitted to the nursing home this past year after he fell and broke a bone in his leg. My grandmother and he were admitted to the hospital a day apart from each other, and she ended up passing away the day after he got discharged to a nursing home. He hasn't been able to do things like warm up food, read out loud, or have a conversation in over a year. I miss him; it's almost like he's already gone. The last time I went to visit him in the nursing home, I couldn't even get a yes/no response out of him to see if he wanted to go back to his room. Somehow or other, he did say ""I love you"" when I said it to him, but I don't know if he even recognized me. Dementia is awful, and I hate it. I'm so sorry you're going through this.",2022-01-06 07:35:54,beepbop21,rxdlgr
Dementia,Advice on finding at home PT / OT for homebound senior,,"The reason they offer less visits is based on what Medicare pays for. The PT/OT that is coming once or twice a week should be providing him with homework: the various exercises written down with instructions and the prescribed amount of times they should be done each day.  The reason home therapists want the family member there at the time of the appointment is so the family member can learn the exercises and how to coach and assist the patient so they can ensure follow through and practice. You don't need a PT/OT just to do the daily exercises prescribed by another PT/OT (and this doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons, including that they are often best done throughout the day and a secondary therapist will be making their own goals and assignments). The family member that's present for the home healthcare therapy appointments can go over them with any home care aide. Even if you have a homecare aide come in for a 4 hour daily minimum required by an agency it would still be less expensive than a 1 hour visit from a private pay PT/OT (if you can even find one to come to your home) plus you will then have the aide there for hours to take care of other stuff besides exercise: laundry, meal prep, hygiene help etc.",2022-01-05 11:06:51,glnomad711,rwqa84
Dementia,"If I am ever diagnosed with Dementia, I am going to either apply for legal euthanasia or kill myself.","I am not going to force my family/spouse to take care of me, I am not going to taint their happy memories of me with memories of me with dementia. I watched my grandpa go to dementia when I was 11 to 14 and no. I am not going to subject ANYONE to that. Dementia is a horrible fucking disease. 

I don't want to be alive if I can't remember who I am, or how to eat or take care of myself. I am just a lifeless husk at that point, and I want to be long gone before  then.","Ugh, I get what you say. It might be, however, that once you're diagnosed, your brain would have already changed past the point where you are still able to make such a decision.
Watching my husband go down this road for ten yrs, I rather die alone in the woods than have my kids endure the emotional trauma and degradation this disease does to survivors and patients, its horrible.
Yeah, I've had the same thought. Unless some kind of treatment is on the horizon, dementia seems unusually cruel, a certain death sentence with a long lingering decline into oblivion. That's worth avoiding. 

Assisted suicide seems much more preferable. Not an option for mom, but I'd be open to it if I ever get diagnosed. To me, the only question is timing. You need the diagnosis to propel such dramatic action, but by then you may not have the capacity to do anything about it.

But also, that's how I feel now. I know from watching my dad's passing from cancer: life gets a lot more precious the closer you come to the end of it. Maybe I'll feel differently then.
Ditto. I'm counting on my husband to give me a bottle of sleeping pills, a bottle of gin, and then leave the room. Watching my dad go from a rational, intelligent, functional human to a stark-raving pants-shitting wreck has been one of the most painful experiences of my life. Not only is it heartbreaking, but frankly, the incredible, soul-and-life-destroying burden of caring for someone with dementia is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
It just kicked into reality facing high gear for my girlfriend. Her Mom is unknowingly destroying her at times. It's heartbreaking on every level to witness. Neither of us know how to handle it.  She barely sleeps anymore because she's laying there waiting for the midnight phone call from her confused Mom. I'm blown away by how much total destructive sadness it brings. I'm glad I found this forum and hope I can get my girlfriend to come here to. I've passed on a lot of helpful info I've found here, so thank you everybody.  Peace
I agree with you. My mom was diagnosed with dementia in 2014. Her body is very healthy at 82 but her ability to remember anything or take care of her basic needs is gone. I know I'm lucky to be able to have her in a memory care facility that takes excellent care of her and she's only 20 minutes away;  it would be extremely difficult to take care of her myself.  
She wouldn't want this for herself. I feel terrible for saying this but when I hear of one of my friends' parents passing away I'm a little jealous, I just want all this to be over. I know with 100% certainty that if I'm diagnosed with dementia I'm not going to wait it out and do this to my family. The grief and isolation that I've experienced is something that I would never want for them.
That’s my situation exactly.  I was diagnosed 4 years ago.  I’m on a really good medication.  I live by myself, and still drive.  I take care of my dog.  I have 3 daughters that I’m in a great relationship with.  I don’t know what the future holds for me.  I’m going to live my life to the best of my ability until I can’t.  You never know what you will actually do until it happens to you.
I am right there with you. Being on the front lines of this disease has shown me how horrible it is not only for the sufferer but also the loved ones. And, it just goes on and on and on. I hope that I have the courage (and sufficient thought process) to do the right thing when the time comes.
If you have kids please consider writing a journal of memories and stories. That's one of the biggest things I had from my Dad. I'm not upset he's gone just wish I got to know him when he was alive. Now I just hear stories from his siblings and I feel like I'm missing a big part of who he was.
It's frightening disease. I hope to punch  out with a sound body, mind and dignity.

Living a long life dictated by that cruel illness, no thanks.
For those of you who disagree with this post, I can give you hundreds of examples of things my wife has done that would mortify you. The one that has scarred the family the most - My wife went out onto the front lawn and started screaming that my daughter and I were having sex-using the most graphic terms imaginable. My adult daughter (who has lived in this neighborhood since she was three) had to go out and drag her back in the house. And we haven’t hit the final stages yet.
I am afraid also. My dad died June 5th from dementia. It is a horrible disease. By the time we realized he had a problem, it was pretty much too late. The last straw, we figured out he wasn't eating, he was putting his plate in the microwave to warm up, but forgot

Dementia sucks
I totally agree with you. The trick will be to get diagnosed early enough that you can still have the mental capacity and physical ability to go out on your own terms. And by the way, what you call “legal euthanasia” in the USA is extremely difficult to do, even in the states that it’s allowed. I’m saving my money to enjoy one last trip to Europe, with a final stop in Switzerland- planned ahead of course. You can’t just show up at one of their clinics unannounced….
I hear you. I wouldn’t want to be around either if I was diagnosed. My mom, a few years ago when she could tell something was wrong, used to say she wanted to kill herself. This woman never had a suicidal bone in her body. Very religious. I didn’t understand why at the time but now I feel it may have been because she knew she wasn’t herself (and it would get worse) and the only way to end this miserable journey was death. 

She pleads now and then that Jesus would let her go. One morning she told me that she’d “died last night”. That was a few months ago. Now she’s back on a never ending loop again, similar to a toddler, incontinent, fearful of the world around her and everyone in it. It’s deeply cruel.
This is completely understandable.

There are a couple of things you should know:

- Dementia robs the sufferers of any means of self appraisal.  They cannot see anything wrong with themselves so are unlikely to trigger any euthanasia.  You’d definitely have to get things written down as others have said.

- There are several views in the science community that you can take action to avoid or minimise dementia through your lifestyle.  These don’t get talked about enough in my view.
Same
Agreed. Which is also why it’s important for you to have a living will, and put into writing your wishes for when your brain isn’t able to make decisions (DNR, feeding vs. tube vs. allowing to starve when you cannot eat anymore, etc.)
I told my wife I want to drive off a Cliff. She’s on board
Honestly it would be better to invest in long-term care insurance so your family can put you in memory care without going bankrupt. By the time you get diagnosed, you sadly may not remember these wishes or you may be like the loved ones who deny anything is wrong.
I know what you mean! I told my bf if I get dementia like my mom, push me down the stairs and don't look back!
It’s illegal everywhere for people to get medical aid in dying for dementia. It’s a catch 22 - you must be “of sound mind” and within months of dying naturally to qualify. Dementia isn’t terminal until way past the point of having a sound mind. 

As a person with a genetic predisposition to dementia I would want this - I think if we make a plan with a lawyer pre-dementia, and we still want to do it when we have dementia , then let us do it. Unfortunately advocating for this is pretty morbid and I don’t want to stress my loved ones  by focusing on it.
[deleted]
I feel the same and feel like it should be an option.
I don't think it will be easier for your family. Suicide is tragic and traumatic.

My father is in bad shape and sometimes he says he will kill himself, but he is past the point he could actually do this. And it heartbreaking to know he thinks that and if that happens, it would be as bad as now. Its just too fucked up...Its not that simple man
Dementia IS a horrible fucking disease that is true. However I believe it’s not so much for the sufferer. Suicide however is incredibly cruel on those left behind leaving them with a lifetime of “What ifs”

One “benefit” for the sufferer of dementia is that you don’t really know you have it. Confusion is sometimes such a natural part of life for all of us at one time or another and the onset and gradual decline of dementia is such a relatively slow process, it’s highly likely that by the time you are like you remember your grandpa to be, you will not be in a position to understand what’s going on half the time anyway.

The other aspect and this is extremely important is that as far as I am aware dementia is NOT hereditary. Just because your grandpa had it doesn’t mean you will.

I actually think you’re overthinking this. What is important is that you keep yourself physically and mentally active for as long as you possibly can. Life is precious. Please ensure you enjoy the rest of yours with those you love and obviously care a great deal about for as long as you possibly can.
I wish you well.
I’ve thought about this, but I’m not sure if it’s the best scenario. If you are early on you’ll feel hopeful that you will last a little longer. When it progresses it’s too late to make a decision like this. I think that the best outcome would be to have enough money so when things go bad you can go to hospice or to an assisted living, so you don’t be a burden to the family. They can come visit but it won’t take a toll on them in such way if they are taking care of you. If you have money many of the problems can be more easily solved. So my goal in life is to have more money so I wouldn’t have to worry about my relatives or myself.
I know it's a common sentiment that we don't want to go that route.  I was afraid my mom would do that.  But it rarely happens that way.  When you're in the early stages of dementia, you don't recognize it in yourself.  You don't think you need help.  And when it gets to the point of desperately needing help, you're past the cognitive ability to a) consent to euthanasia and b) follow through on suicide.  

And I really think that though mom complains all the time, she has a fairly good quality of life.  Yes, she can't do a lot of things she used to do.  But she can hang out with her cat and knit.  So while it's horrible to think of from an outsider's perspective, she's probably more content now than she's ever been because she lacks the cognitive ability to compare her life now with her life before.
For my Dad he believed he was right and everyone was wrong so this change can happen. The way it was progressing he would have hurt himself if I wasn't here. His driving was dangerous. He would do electrical work on live wires. Put metal in the microwave. Leave the stove on. You will probably end up killing yourself it just won't be the way you think.
Understandable my moms 60ish n i never wanna be like that. Give me some pills n a bottle n tell me to go for a walk into the forest
Me too
You have to be of sound mind for physician assisted suicide :( but there are other options that many older folks do use. I don't know the rules of Reddit so I won't say anything here
My father died last night after years of slowly descending into dementia. It has been terribly emotionally and psychologically painful for everyone, including him.

There is a small silver lining, and it is that we have all grieved much of our loss in advance. It hurts that he has passed, but the heartbreak and tears that we shed over the last however long have served to make his passing less pronounced. 

I wouldn’t want my wife and kids to go through what I’ve gone through, and I don’t want to go through what my Dad went through, but that extended grieving has made it more tolerable that he is gone. He was suffering, and all of us were suffering, so his passing is more of a relief than a tragedy. And that counts for something.
Its depressing coming to a community for help and this is the first thing you read.
I truly just came here to post the exact same thing.

My mother is going through this, and it’s gut wrenching to see the woman that raised me go through this.

I won’t do this to my wife, my kids, or anyone.

I promise I will do my best to plan it well enough to like like an accident, and I will go quickly. I love all my people far too much to make them suffer as they watch my slow and painful degradation.
yeah same. listening to my older siblings tell me stories about my grandma doing all these things knowing that she can’t anymore and will never be able to again is devastating. the sheer amount of stress my mum is under is horrible to watch
me too, i’ll make sure of it, somehow

I am conducting a survey for a school project on memory cafes as a way to help improve support for individuals struggling with the effects of dementia.

Dementia,Suggestions for comfortable recliners/chairs?,"My dad has pretty severe dementia, pretty weak overall. Honestly, I don't think he has much time left, but whatever time he has, we'd like for him to be comfortable. He's having a lot of difficulty getting out of chairs, and I'm thinking about getting a lazy-boy recliner with a power-lift capability.

Did anyone get something like this for their loved one with dementia, and was it a good purchase? Any suggestions, things for us to keep in mind?","I bought one for my mom that lifts her up as well.

As a side issue, we also gave her a robotic cat, and when she puts the cat on the chair, she thinks it's occupied and won't sit in it lol. But in terms of a specific chair, I'd say definitely having the lift function is a must at this point. Your father is lucky you're thinking of his comfort, even for a little while.
the power-lift capability will weaken his getting up muscles and imo 'trap' him into being unable to get out of other chairs at all 

if he's in an institution, perhaps they've a competent staff person who is aware of that problem and can advise you
My father would not be capable of recalling how to use a remote on a power lift chair, so we use a chair 'riser' instead, which is a platform the chair sits on. It is just a few inches tall, but that added height makes all the difference in getting up out of a chair.
I have a ""Catnapper"", it reclines and lifts. It has a remote that is permanently attached so it cant be lost. I find it pretty comfortable, bought to recover from a surgery, I need that lift for a while. It should come up with a google search. It has back support, the cheaper recliners tend to drop away when you recline,
Bought one online for my grandmother when she was alive, she hated it because it was way too big for her. Make sure the chair fits him well. Also, it seemed like it would be plush but it is actually kind of 'hard'. I wouldn't buy one sight unseen again.
Hello! Yes the power lift chairs are amazing! You can get the chairs that will elevate to standing - which is especially great for mobility issues. You can get chairs that recline back that can be used in lieu of a bed if the person cannot lie flat for health reasons. 

There are so many options available in every price range. The only consideration would be something that fits into their room/home and maybe put one of their blankets or throws on the chair so that it is familiar to them. Sometimes I have had difficulty getting someone who is in more advanced stages to use the chair regularly because they don't recognize it as theirs. However, that is not something I see often, just mentioning it as something to keep in mind when picking out a chair. It is beautiful that you are so in tune with your dad's needs and comfort - this will definitely help to improve quality of life.

Take care!
A lift chair will help your mom since she’s the one bearing the weight of getting him in and out. I recommend getting one that is vinyl because cleanup will be easier. If he has trouble with leaning and slumping to one side, try and get one that will possibly help support him so he can stay upright easier.

Seriously, this chair is needed for your mom’s sake. My mom broke her back tending to my dad . We had no idea. She was complaining about her back hurting but going to the doctor for herself wasn’t the priority, unfortunately. She kept refusing to make an appointment. Finally, after my dad died, she went. It was too late for them to do anything about it. They tried to “cement” it back together, but it didn’t work. Had she gone early on, the procedure would likely have been successful and saved her years of back pain. Her back still hurts, but not as much as in that first year.
My Dad had problems with the remote as well. It caused him frustration and I had to be on call to always have an eye on him so I could operate the chair for him to get up or reclined. Since your Mom already has to help him, this might not be a big issue. I agree with sitting in one first to make sure it's comfortable. The one I got had a pretty long seat front to back which necessitated scooting back in order to be really comfortable in the lower back - but my Dad can't scoot forward and back very well and it requires a lot of direction from me.",2022-01-04 17:56:12,crabblue6,rw77lu
Dementia,A different person every day,"Dementia is such an odd, awful disease. I'm just struck today (not for the first time) by the spectrum of mental capability my Dad exhibits day to day. There is nothing linear about the decline (well, maybe from a very high level). At a low level -- currently serving as his caregiver until we get a professional -- I'm just struck by how different he is day to day. One day he'll do nothing but sit and watch television and really just stare vacantly. Another he'll be belligerent and angry about the situation (as he perceives it which can also vary from thinking he needs to move to his ""real"" home or thinking he's staying in a hotel).

Yesterday he was as close to being my Dad as he has been in 6-9 months. If I wasn't looking closely, I could imagine that we'd be just discussing golf or the football game or whatever we did 2 years ago. Took his pills by himself, prepared his own meals, did things he hasn't done in a year (worked out!) and got to bed at a reasonable time.

Today? My Dad is gone. He called me ""the electrician"" because apparently he needs some electrical work done in his bedroom (likely a burned out bulb LOL). And, he acts as though he's in a motel and I'm the manager. The electrical work is needed in the ""Men's Room"" which, I guess, is the bathroom connected to his bedroom.

Just sad today. I got a taste of how easy and nice things used to be around here when he was still around. But, it also has served as a reminder and I'm more convinced than ever that my time as a caregiver needs to end. He's only going downhill from here and his needs will only increase.

His physical health is quite good which means 3-5 more years (probably) of ... this. Then you have to ask yourself not only if you want to do this for 3-5 more years but more and more and more as his condition declines. I think I have to do what I've been avoiding and make 2022 the year of the professional caregiver or even a facility.

Sad times. But, time to get my life back.","I think sometimes those brief flashes of the person they were before, while at that moment feel like a gift, are cruel to those who love them. My mom, a couple of months before she died had about an hour of perfect clarity, she knew something was wrong with her brain, we talked about things rationally and I explained why she was in a nursing home (without going into the dementia thing because it seemed like that would be too much) and we talked about family, friends, gossiped a bit, laughed and then in a blink, she was back to the confused, angry person I usually saw. It was so bittersweet.  


Getting help or getting him placed in a good facility will be good for both of you.  When you can come visit and be his daughter again instead of the person who worries about meds, bathing, bathroom trips, etc. it changes things immensely.
My heart breaks every day as little by little my stepfather is taken hostage by this disease. The absolute worst part is that he knows that his disease is progressing, it is so much worse to know - there is a term we use in regards to people suffering with dementia Anosognosia - it means that you don't know that you don't know. When people are unaware of their medical condition and cognitive decline it is almost merciful - I literally find myself crying at the most random changes - One of the things that have been really hard is that his brother and SIL both have dementia as well, they are both in advanced stages and are in an assisted living facility. Recently my stepfather was allowed to visit (have not been able to because of covid restrictions) and had a really good visit with his brother - later on that night my mom called his brother and SIL and the SIL said ""E had a really good visit with his friend today, I don't know what his name is but E said he knew him in grade school"" ... my stepfather started crying and I felt so helpless. It made me feel like the roles were reversed like I was the mother, holding and comforting him when his heart was hurt. I hate this disease.

OP I want you to know that the best thing you can do for yourself and your father is to take care of your physical and mental health - asking for help in whatever form that takes (homecare or assisted living) is acknowledgement that you are doing the best you possibly can to care for your father. It is not easy and it can bring up a lot of complicated and overwhelming feelings but at the end of the day it is about the quality of life for yourself/family and your dad.
I feel lucky, my dad hallucinates and makes up his stories but still knows who I am. Before the meds he exhibited all kinds of different manic negative behaviors. For now he’s better and not a zombie. During his life he rarely stayed in hotels or motels. I’d like to think he has nothing to draw on there. At this point every device is a machine.  I gave him a smart phone because he saw everyone else using them. He has made two calls on it.  One was an angry one to me about money.  The other was a former neighbor who thought he could have a conversation where he disagreed with a crazy man.
My Dad knows there is a problem and hopes at times it will go away. I think he knows it will not.  He used to tell stories that are now very truncated.  I estimate this started mid summer 2020 and seems to have progressed rapidly. Dr guessed stage 5 or 6 on the 7 stage.
I describe it to my friends as my dad is a five year old. He does what you would expect a five year old to do at this point. He wipes himself, he can put clothes on himself (though not always appropriate attire for the situation), and recognizes when he’s hungry (most of the time). What he can’t do is determine what kind of bowl he needs, where it goes, how he should bathe, turn the tv on or off, or keep track of something. 

Sometimes he can act like a mature 5 year old when he calls on old memories but most of the time he’s confused and lost. 

Each day is so different like you described. He’ll be combative like a five year old with big emotions, and sometimes he is just so content to do nothing. He’s happiest when he’s talking at me even though they’re not complete sentences and make no sense. 

You’re not alone friend. I’m 32 and also my dads caregiver. I completely understand what you’re going through.
It's as if you wrote about my experience this past 2 days and the realization I came to today that I need a professional caregiver during moms awake hours.  On Christmas day she was happy and enjoyed her family in the living room.  Yesterday she was angry and defiant.  Today she did not get out of bed til 1pm.  Ate some fruit and toast at 2pm in her pajamas.  Then just sat and stared at her daily briefing I write for her for an hour.  It's just a few facts like where she lives and how I live upstairs.   She thinks her mom is alive and that she needs to go home.  Physically shes healthy but mentally she is far gone.  It's very sad
Our dad died from dementia this past June. Treasure the moments of clarity. 

One of my favorites: my dad's barber was a childhood friend of ours that live 20 minutes away. He came to the house to cut dad's hair. After he left, my dad said ""he hung around with Charles (my uncle) in Freeport right""? Yes dad, but he lives here now. My dad said ""I thought so, his name is Donnie, right?"" 

Dementia sucks, but not for that 10 minutes

We took care of him at home 24/7 for 2 1/2 years, there are 5 of us

((HUGS))
How long have you been caring for your father? I'm in the early months with my mother. I moved home in October as I knew something was up and things have already gotten so much worse. She's still mostly herself but her mood changes wildly day to day. She's starting to refer to me as her sister and treats me like it, which is hard and upsetting. I wonder how long I can help her day to day before I can't manage anymore. Emotionally it's quite a brutal experience.
My first time visiting this sub. My father just went from a little struggling to find the best word to not knowing my name in 5-6 days. Emergency appointment tomorrow, will hopefully get like a treatment or something.
This is almost exactly like my father. But I havent seen a moment of him in two years. You are ""lucky"" to get a small moment of him

I still remember. I was leaving with my mom and he would stay alone for a few hours

He said:

""I am alright, dont worry! I will be ok""

But in his normal voice...and thats it",2022-01-03 08:38:29,bearmoosewolf,rv1x1t
Dementia,looking for early adopters for anxiety management app designed for neurodiverse folks,"hey folks! 

I am looking for early adopters of free anxiety management game-based app. 

I am myself disabled and doing my best to design the app as accessible as possible. 

I am trying to make the app provide a great experience for folks with dementia this year. 

Please DM me if interested. My app is free and doesn't need any registration.","People with dementia have a disease. They are not ""neurodiverse"".  Attempting to teach someone with dementia to use an app in order to manage their anxiety is not at all appropriate for this group of people.",2022-01-03 05:11:20,Bulky_Highlight_3352,ruyfeq
Dementia,Missing caregiver?,"My Dad was in my home for 4 months. Staying alone, used cameras to keep watch. He drove off twice in his truck before I put gps and retrieved him the third time after which we finally got a doctor who actually helped. Got meds that tamped down his manic states and now almost 9 months later we seem to have some stability he thinks he doesn’t have his license and hasn’t driven.  But recently his main caregiver is out for knee surgery and he seems to be attacking her for taking him all around. Claims she spent $600 of his on Xmas (impossible) and drove him all over. Wondering if this happens a lot? He was ( to me) getting along famously with this particular caregiver.","Yea, my dad can turn on someone in a split second. I'm the only female and we decided that I'm not to be alone with him ever. Before he got worse, he's accused me of stealing money, lying about stuff ect... Then when my turn was over, it was one of the boys. Always just ""said"" stuff. Recently he apparently made some serious threats against me and my brother said the way he said was just different, weird and eery. So just to be safe, I am not around him alone.
My grandma is very similar. She constantly accuses her full time caregiver of theft. Every other day she would rampage through the caregiver’s closet and claim that it was stolen from her.   
We tried everything from showing her video feeds (obviously logical explanations don’t work), telling her we will buy her new clothes (bribery also didn’t work..), and finally medicating her.   
Unfortunately, it still happens pretty frequently and her tantrums haven’t stopped.
Could be dementia hallucinations.
We got a formal diagnosis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s earlier this month. Dad has declined steadily since last April.   He worries where I am and when I’ll be home. Up until recently he would just head off to bed.  Now he sits close to me and I suggest bed time.  He watched 60 minutes about the Havana syndrome and joked maybe that was his problem.",2022-01-03 00:16:04,wrpd,rutto6
Dementia,Marijuana dosage,"Hello and thank you in advance for any assistance provided. I’ve read a couple of threads from people who use marijuana as a way to curb/alleviate certain moods/episodes/symptoms, but never any mention of actual dosing. My grandmother has been having periods (one day great, the next day spiraling with crying, depressive episodes (about things that happened decades ago) or just general apathy and they subside a few hours later and it appears that she has no recollection of them.) After hearing positive stories about the use of marijuana, we (her family) would like to explore this option for her in hopes of making her day to day more comfortable. Any insight would be appreciated.","Firstly, I am not a doctor, and cannot provide medical advice. However, I have been working in cannabis for many years. If you live in a legal state, it could be worth consulting your loved one's doctor or getting a medical card. Budtenders cannot give you medical advice in dispensaries unless you have a medical card, due to fda regulations. 

Start low and slow with  a 2.5mg dosage. Watch how your loved one reacts and up the dosage if needed. Please note it takes about an hour for ingested cannabis to take effect. If you are in a legal state, when you go into your Dispensary, ask your budtender for a product intended for microdosing. I would suggest getting something that has CBD in it, as well, as it can mitigate the negative effects of thc. You could also look into CBG, which is non-psychoactive, but is said to have a positive effect on mood (the G stands for giggles). 

Please let me know if you have any questions and I will help if I can.


Edit: do not try to make your own edibles to give to her, as there is not a good way to figure out the thc content of the finished product. You want to make sure you are using a product with a controlled dosage.

Dementia,Is there any way to curb the endless roaming at night,"My mom is mid-stage and is rapidly progressing. I'm staying with her in her one bedroom apartment while in town to help her with some stuff and get her ready for assisted living. 

She roams ENDLESSLY between 8pm & 11pm. It's so unnerving and has me on edge all the time. She stays mainly in her bedroom opening and closing drawers, bags, etc. Sometimes she shuffles around the living room where I'm sleeping. It's eerie and haunting. (I'm pretty sure when she's gone, I'll wake up to the sound of her shoes slowly shuffling across the floor.) 

When she's done roaming, she must just fall into bed because she barely moves the covers down and wakes in the morning fully clothed with makeup smeared all over her face. For someone whose vanity was always top routine, this is difficult to witness.

This evening I tried to suggest she get some night clothes out for bed and she got pissy and defensive with me. I took that's my cue to get out of her sight and left her to do her nightly roaming.

Are there any ways to help gently persuade someone with dementia to take better care of themselves in getting ready for bed and then getting into bed?","My wife was also mid stage and rapidly progressing when her anger and belligerence from her conspiracy theories and hallucinations became out of control. At night she would lay in bed and it was nonstop talking or she would get up to fix something or help someone. Her psychiatrist prescribed a program of common psychiatric drugs that either corrected or greatly diminished her symptoms.
You could ask her doctor about trazodone. It is an anti anxiety medication that relaxes you that a lot of folks take at night. My grandmother does a lot of nighttime wandering but that did help. Today we had to put a tall baby gate at the end of her hallway because she has really steep wooden stairs and I barely caught her before she fell down. So now we have the gate and a chair for her to sit while someone has time to run up and help her down. She threw a massive fit over it but is now more understanding about it. My grandmother also used to be super vain and careful with her appearance and now I can’t get her to brush her teeth or get out of dirty nightgowns. I think it is a combination of confusion and depression. One thing that has helped is to use humor or excessive flattery to get her to take care herself, “wow grandma you are ripe! I think the neighbors can smell you! Do you need help with a shower?” “Hey remember that yellow top? You look so pretty in that let’s put it on!” “There how now you are fresh as a daisy!”. Also putting on her favorite music while helping her do something she no longer has the motivation to do. It’s really hard at first but doing less asking and more doing will help as well. When giving options it is always no. Also make sure she can’t open your doors to the outside with some child safety locks. Good luck and I hope you get some really good rest tonight!
This is only a suggestion, you could try lavender essential oil using an essential oil diffuser, it might help to calm down.

Another suggestion is reflexology, below is a YouTube link to reflexology for dementia patients. 
Hope this is useful for you, 
I hope and pray you get some relief and hopefully get a good sleep. 

My dad passed away 2 years ago with Dementia, now unfortunately my partner has recently been diagnosed with mixed Vascular Dementia and Alzheimer’s.
Peace & blessings to you. 🙏👍

Dementia,Is anyone else as done with it all as I am?,"Worked and slaved and cooked and cleaned 7 days a week, just to have to listen to my dad screaming at us constantly:
""I'm being railroaded!""
""You kidnapped me!""
""No one around here knows anything!""
""No one around here ever does anything to help me!""
""I'm calling the police and going back home and you'll be in prison!""
""Stop calling me Dad.. I never had kids!""


My dad regularly tried to make phone calls with the TV remote, tried to shave with the phone, and tried to change TV channels with his electric razor. But he was still coherent enough to tell me that he hated me and my home, all the while asking for sexual favors from my wife, my daughter, my daughter in law, and his granddaughter. Had it been legal, Id have taken him out and shot him. He was never a father to me, he was always a guy who let me know I wasnt important in his life.

Then, when his last wife passed and non one else was there, he landed in my lap. I woke up every day to care for him. He'd look me in the face and call me ""ma'am"" and deny that I was his son. He absolutely hated me and wanted away from me every fucking day.

But.... Literally, the day we got him placed in a nursing home, the staffers were calljng me saying he wanted to speak with his son and named me by my full birth name.

I don't care anymore. I hope he dies soon so that I dont have to deal with his bank or his taxes or his pharmacy or his underwear, or any of my step-siblings that told me ""well, hes not my dad"" but still call me asking if they have an inheritance coming any time soon...

Fuck them all. Fuck him, fuck them, fuck it. I'd sooner put a slug through mt head than be a caregiver ever again.


Rant over.","Along with crappy diapers, giving drug addicts $20 out the back door. Riding with said drug addicts to the bank, giving out ssn over the phone, switching electric and gas companies to 3rd party companies, ordering $300 worth of braces over the phone, leaving the phone off the hook, going outside leaving the phone in the house…
So we moved in and took care of him 24/7 2 1/2 years round the clock in his home. He died June 5 but there were 5 of us. It’s not a one person job

PS my mother was in a nursing home and I was her POH… unless she got mad at me and reversed it….until she needed me….after the 3rd time we had a meeting with all the bigwigs who told she had to sign and no more changes(which was illegal but she didn’t know🤷🏽‍♀️)

Be pissed off, frustrated, aggravated and agitated it’s ok

Dementia sucks
I’m not quite to the point you are, but I feel your pain and am glad you have him placed somewhere that can hopefully deal with his issues. Sounds like you and your family went WAY above and beyond, probably more than he deserved. Be proud of that. It’s perfectly understandable to be DONE after that much stress and abuse.
Sorry to hear your saga … My mom died suddenly in March 2017 (they were married almost 60 yrs) My dad went directly into middle spectrum Lewy Bodies dementia … my sister and I tried like hell to take away his car keys but within 4 months he got in a horrible car accident that almost killed him and injured another driver … almost died twice in a 9 day span n trauma … after that it was hell … he was in a wheelchair so now he was in a home … I had to sell his home to afford his nursing care) he accused ONLY me of causing his accident, stealing his money, trying to kill him, hiding the fact that mom had left him for another man (6 months later he accused me of killing her so I could steal his money), colluding with the nurses to drug him and kidnap him … he told them to call the police and have me arrested multiple times he spit at me when I visited and took a swing at me more than a few times … when anyone would come to visit him, he’d go on and on about how this guy comes in and acts like his son but is stealing his Money yada yada yada … He always remembered my sister and treated her with respect and love … I was his power of attourney over financial AND medical decisions, paid all the bills, constant interaction with the home to schedule dr vids it’s and had to OK all the meds that they kept changing … Oh Christ I was dealing with my own personal nightmare at the time and was slipping into personal depression … thought about ending it all a few times … 2 months before HE died in Feb 2020, everything cleared up … he came back to the sweet gentle loving father that raised me … he remembered everything and had NO memory of all the horrible things he said … he was put in hospice on a Tuesday with 6 months to live … died THAT Saturday …5 days later … it was sad but a relief for everyone but luckily he came around JUST in the KNICK OF TIME
Yeah. And my dad wasn't even a bad guy to start with. Before the dementia he was a good dad and nice person. Then the insane paranoia and aggression took over and welp. After all those times he screamed at me and threatened me and yelled the most nonsensical accusations at me and tried to grab the wheel while I was driving him home after taking him out for ice cream because he suddenly believed I was kidnapping him and the time he tried to strangle me because I was apparently somehow murdering thousands of people every night...I know it's the dementia, I know they don't even really know what they're doing, but I keep thinking that it doesn't make it any less traumatizing for US when we have to live in an environment that under any other circumstances would be called abusive. And yet we're stuck there, caring all day every day for the person who's terrifying and hurting us. No wonder we're exhausted.
Jesus. I hope it's over soon. At least my father didn't become a savage (yet). Can't imagine this.
I am right there with you.  I just want to stop giving him his medicine and let nature take its course.  The day we get him in a home will be one of the best days of my life!  He was kinda an asshole before (but life was going his way so it showed little) but he is just a pure asshole now.  I am doing all of this (sold my home and moved I with my folks at 40) for my mother.
I FEEL YOU. Everyday I have the urge to push my grandma down the stairs. She’s driving me INSANEEE. She was never a great grandma and her dementia is showing the narcissistic behavior even more. 

I hate her. I wish I have a lovely grandma.
Both my dear mum and dad. wonderful parents. wonderful people. so heartbreaking... but I'm eternally grateful that neither were or are mean or aggressive and they recognize that I am a familiar and safe and loving person in their lives...
I think there’s always one solid family member landed with it whether they can do it or not.
For our family, our mother “accepted this burden” but has left my sister and I do all the work 
I’m certain when my nana passes away my sibling will do the whole song and dance for grieving and getting attention and boy oh boy and I going to cause a scene. 

I do hope you recognise that you’re an exceptional person for caring right now, but I do agree, that one can only do it once in a life time.
Right there with you. I hit the point long ago where I've taken care of my father way more than he ever took care of me, including changing diapers.

He was an asshole to everyone, and since I'm his only capable blood relative, I'm stuck with him.
I’m helping my partner take care of her older brother who has dementia and this scares me.
I’m going through this with my Dad.  He’s sweet as hell to me-most of the time.

However, he’s a mean old man to my poor Mom, and my Brother- who is just a sweetheart guy.

He isn’t quite to the point of requiring 24/7 care.  He won’t remember, or admit to being awful.  

I hope you get some peace soon.  In the meantime, vent away, if anything for your own mental health.
I hear ya, that's fucked!  Well, it's less fucked now -  I'm very happy for you that he's somewhere else, hooraay!.  So sorry fr yr wife & daughter & others, well done you all that you made it through all that!!.   

 My older sister has NPD - Narcissistic Personality Disorder - so, yeh... Lives in my mums house (mum alzhms, 2009 diagnosis, I'm carer) for free, won't lift a finger to help with ANYthing,  rants on about her 'rightful' inheritance.  grrrrr..   She can fuck off too!
I was fresh out of college with dreams and wishlists then came covid my grandfather's dementia got worse and during the same time my father got stroke and later was diagnosed with cancer we have lost all our money on medical bills. My grandfather thinks this is not his house, whenever he gets a chany he leaves the house with his medicine pouch to go to lord knows where I'm the only child to my parents and we don't have any other immediate family either. Every single day I think I never did a thing wrong in my life, why me ? And yes I forgot to mention my mother has arthritis. I hate my life to the point that I just want to run away
im sorry. god give you the patience to get through this emotionally and mentally okay.
If you can, put him in the VA. If not, start making plans to put him in a home. You need to live your life, especially if they were neglectful and abusive. I'm going on over a year now with my father who is barely showing symptoms.. and the terrible things my grandmother is saying to me because they've never bothered to sift through the lies to find out who I am, or what I've done for him, in spite of how he treated me.. I get it. If you get to the point where you can't continue, make sure to set up something for his future before you get to the point where you don't care either way.

Dementia,Terminal restlessness,"Last week Hospice said our grandmother is at the terminal restlessness stage and tonight our dad sent a message that our grandmother is refusing to eat and drink. From what we’ve read she could pass away soon. She seems to remember us when we call, but she is calling out to her deceased sister repeatedly. Has anyone in this group experienced this with a family member? She took a major decline in a matter of a month. My visits in November to December it was like a completely different person. Our dad is suggesting we not visit her anymore because he wants our last memories to not be how she is now. I want to see her but maybe he’s right? My sisters and I are torn.","Our dad died at home on hospice surrounded by his children, grands and greatgrands. 
I’m not sure what terminal restlessness means but our dad would extend his arm and hands up and wave. Our hospice nurse said he was reaching for someone in heaven or felt someone was reaching for him. There was also a picture near the hospital bed and he would grab hold so tight, we had to move it, the nurse said again he was holding on to someone. It’s a personal choice. I’m in Illinois and great grands from Missouri and Indiana drove up to see my dad, even though he was asleep. The 13 year old came with my daughter. Great grands from Milwaukee were there a week prior. 
My dad loved all of them and knew them all even if he forgot some names,but more importantly they knew and loved him.

There is no right or wrong here, just listen to your heart and do what you feel is best for you
I wish I could give you a hug right now. It is heartbreaking to lose a loved one. No one can tell you what is right for you, it has to be what you feel in your heart. 

I can give you my experience and perspective from someone whose father died in a nursing home. My father and I had been estranged for a few years before his dementia became advanced - he was diagnosed with bone cancer and at that point I had not seen him for several years. I thought that I would be able to say goodbye without seeing him, because in my mind he wasn't ""my"" dad anymore, the disease had completely ravaged him, stripped him of his personhood. A few days before Christmas my half sister contacted me to tell me the doctor felt he was going to die within the next few days - he was unresponsive at that time and was being given morphine for comfort. I made the last minute decision to see him -- It was difficult, I won't lie and say it was easy. It is heart wrenching because it feels like this is just the shell of the person that you loved - regardless, I felt that I had to tell him that I love him and that I forgive him and that I hope he forgives me for being so stubborn. I just sat there, cried and held his hand. In those moments I realized that even though this disease robbed him of his dignity and his memories it could never take away the love we shared and the bond we had - he was always going to be my father and I felt that I needed to honor him by saying goodbye in person.

He passed within a day of my seeing him. That was 14 years ago, not a day goes by that I regret seeing him. In the end, your choice has to be made for you - the only thing that I can tell you is that once someone is physically gone, there is no going back. I wish you and your family love, peace and comfort for the days ahead. Take care.",2022-01-02 20:12:16,Financial_Elephant41,ruow5g
Dementia,I saw this video on instagram and found it enlightening … the disease can be so bad … but it literally brought a tear to my eye …,,🖤🖤🖤,2022-01-02 19:46:28,Madmax8080,ruocj4
Dementia,Priceless gems among the difficulties of caring for mum,"Mum told me that she thought people on her television couldn't see her, but now she's certain they can.  She was eating a sandwich while watching Al Jazeera.  She said the presenter told her off for eating in front of them while thousands were starving.  She said she didn't know whether to keep eating her sandwich or what to do...  She went on to tell me there is one news presenter who smiles at her, so she always smiles back.

 Bless her soul.  Sad and funny in the same moment.","My mum talks to nick jr cartoons...
My dad has a thing for the actress who plays Lily in the AT&T commercials. If she’s not in an ad, he moans “There was no Lily!”
Yep. My mom had the same thing with CNN. She hasn't talked about it in a long time but thought they were right there, broadcasting from the living room. She wondered if they ever looked at her scrapbooks when she went to bed at night.
Ugh.  My mom sees monsters and sometimes thinks my dad has been taken over by an imposter or the devil.  Then, a couple months back my mother-in-law asked us if the ""people in the tv"" could see us.  Because she ""smiled at the little girl and the girl smiled back.""
Days are getting tough, but the only way to go is through...
The people on Al Jazerra can see you.",2022-01-02 19:36:27,Rob_CHCH,ruo4qm
Dementia,How do I help my mum adjust?,"My dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimer’s a month ago and my mum isn’t being patient. They’ve been married for 50 years. The diagnosis was not a shock, for the last 12 months we’ve noticed changes.

She’s 5 years younger and is super sharp. She’s not cutting him any slack, telling him he’s wrong about stuff, telling him to hurry up. Pointing out that his weird stories about the past aren’t true (he embellishes stories about his youth but I’d listen to them all day long if I could) but she can’t let it go. 

She’s constantly pointing out that he’s losing/hiding stuff or dressing odd (textbook, harmless stuff). She understands (or seems to) that he lives in a slightly different reality now (even tho he’s still very much himself, most of the time) but sometimes it’s like she behaves like she can nag him out of cognitive decline. Like she can nag him out of the new, unusual habits he’s forming, like her snapping at him for not following complex plots on TV will suddenly make him understand when in reality IT IS JUST MAKING HIM FEEL LIKE SHIT. 

I can’t get through to her that she is making herself the enemy which she cannot be if wants to be his caregiver in the future (which she insists she does). His perception of her will be that she is lying when she’s telling him he’s wrong which will erode trust. She doesn’t seem willing to adjust her behaviour, learn about how the disease will change his behaviour, learn about coping mechanisms and tiny little adjustments that she can make (even just laying out his clothes for him, instead of letting him pick his clothes which she then complains about.. if she feels so strongly about which clothes he should wear, why would she expect him to chose exactly what she thinks he should wear when she knows that decision making is something he will be struggling with now).

I cannot argue with her about it, I know she’s struggling to adjust but it’s almost like she’s increased the nagging since he got his diagnosis, speeding up the pace of her conversations (that she KNOWS he will not be able to keep up with). She and I have had some great, in depth conversations about how we as a family can make life easier for him and us but she is not putting any of it into practice. It’s almost like she lets him make the mistakes so that she can nag him about it afterwards. Why is she doing this?

I can feel myself getting angry with her for being so stubborn and I am biting my lip for fear of arguing with her but I am also terrified that if she doesn’t adjust soon, my dad will associate her with negativity as his condition progresses. I am very very close to her but I don’t know how to get through to her that her being like this is destructive. 

Has anyone else encountered this? I understand that she is in the early stages of losing the man she’s known since she was a teenager but what happens if she simply can’t adjust?","Sit her down with Teepa Snow videos on YouTube. That's what finally got my family to understand that Mom wasn't exactly Mom any more and we had to meet her where she was because she wasn't coming back to us.
She's fearful, and this acting out is her way of coping.  

Excellent food choices might slow and just possibly reverse some of his dementia (I've read in several places where 8 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day, consistently, are a fair preventive step; as well, turmeric (an ingredient in curry) may be helpful \[India's dementia rate is 1/4 that of westerners\], and, the French do very well (all that wine drinking -- but welch's concord grape juice likely has comparable benefits).
I have watched the same dynamic with my parents and regardless of how many times any of us kids have asked my Mom to be more patient, the conversation ends with her saying ""i know i need to be more patient, i wish i was, i am trying my best""  and then she goes back to being impatient.  When she steps back, she knows what she needs to do,  but in the moment she goes back to the same behavior, then feels bad about it

&#x200B;

It has gotten better over time, and she's never ever been like ""you're so stupid or dumb or whats your problem"" , i.e. she's not insulting or berating or mean,  just scared and frustrated that the person she's loved for 50 years is kind of a child in many ways now.

&#x200B;

I have been around them a lot and I can say that my only course of action has been to try and lead by example.  Give my Dad a lot of time to answer questions or make decisions,  repeat questions as many times as he needs without getting mad etc,  and I hope it has helped but I don't know if it has or not.

&#x200B;

If your mom can't adjust then just do your best to make sure that absolutely everyone else your dad deals with IS acting the way you would want your Mom to,  extra patient and supportive and kind, gently correct mistakes etc,  and hopefully she will start to exhibit the behavior too.  It's not a quick fix, but it might be what works",2022-01-02 17:25:35,DottieLassen,rul79h

Dementia,How to get him to use a walker or wheelchair,"FIL is falling a lot now and it's only a matter of time until he breaks something (actually he broke his finger already). He's in memory care and has gone to the hospital twice for wound care (stitches the first time, the second time just needed cleaning up). He won't use a walker or wheelchair consistently and I was wondering if anyone here found a trick to get their LO to use something to help them move around. He's in the later stages of dementia at this point and struggles to understand most things. Sometimes he's not recognizing his son. So it will be hard to get anything across from a rational perspective.","If they were not using a Walker or wheelchair prior to the onset of dementia or in early diagnosis, their brain maybe unable to learn a new skill. My dad needed a walker but was unable to remember how to use it, so we took the place of the walkef
I’m in the same boat with my Gran. I’m lurking to see if anyone has any good tips. It feels impossible to teach anything new.
My mom couldn't walk so this wasn't an issue but there was a gentleman in the memory care with her that tried walking by himself all the time. Basically the staff always had to keep reminding him, sometimes bringing him the walker. He couldn't retain the knowledge that he needed it.
Does he use hipsavers? There is a good chance he may never take to using the walker but there is some benefit to applying adaptive wear items that may help prevent hip fractures with falls. They are available in an undergarment form and as well you can get them in the form of sweatpants. They aren't cheap but they do help in that there is some padding present along the sides at the hip. This is something we recommend often for our LTC residents who are at high fall risk.
We struggled with that with my grandma, she was only just getting to use a cane more regularly when she started taking a turn for the worst and as a result it never became a habit.  Honestly it might be near impossible unless you are there to remind them to use it whenever they get up.  The only solution that worked in the LTC I worked in was to just belt the person into the wheelchair with a locking belt.  Which... is obviously not ideal, and you don't want to take away their mobility if they are still able to walk, but unfortunately some residents were too much of a fall risk.
Perhaps you could make his walker more 'home like', by attaching familar favorite objects to it.
My dad refused to use a simple cane … and then he had a car accident (no he always found a way to get in a car and drive) … thank god he didnt hurt anyone, but eventually he had a bad car accident that put him in a wheelchair … he’d constantly try to stand up even though his hip was shattered and he would no longer be able to walk … I believe to them, its admitting that they will lose independence … an twisted sense of a generation that NEVER wanted help",2022-01-02 12:03:02,Tanagara,rudx96
Dementia,Getting Help,"Good morning! I am my grandmothers live in caretaker and I looking for some advice. She has had dementia for years and after my grandfather died three years ago she has heavily declined. She does not brush her teeth and she does not clean herself, she also has accidents in her depends every day. She is physically capable of taking care of herself but I think she is really depressed so she doesn’t. My mother is going to do a zoom call with the doctor and my grandmother this week to see about getting hospice care and a prescription for depends. Is there any specific way I should ask my mom to phrase things so I get the help I need? My grandma is refusing the idea of a nurse but I am desperate for help. I also have my two kids under five. She used to be the kindest person on the planet but now she is a really angry and bossy person who doesn’t care if she runs me to the ground and said she would rather see me leave than have me bring a nurse in. The sad part is that she is penniless and I am the only relative left who will live with her as she has already burned out three other families. I live in the US and I’ve heard that insurance will cover someone coming in. Thank you so much for any insight!","Grandma’s choice is no longer you or her living by herself. Her choice is you plus a nurse, or her going to a facility paid for by Medicare.
Until she moves to a care facility I recommend just simply telling her, time for a shower and lead her to the bathroom. She has dementia and can’t remember hygiene unless prompted. Even if she’s physically capable of showing herself, you need to prompt her. Hand her the shampoo and tell her to wash her hair, same with the soap and a wash cloth. 

Morning and night, ask her to come to the bathroom and put tooth paste on her brush and cue her to brush her teeth. Afterwards pour some mouth wash into a disposable cup and have her rinse. It will improve her hygiene so much. I recommend an anti septic mouth wash like Listerine Total Care.
You are not able to take care of her 24/7, yes you need help. The trick is figuring out what help is needed to keep her safe. Her doctor should be able to help figure it out, up to and including medication of if she qualifies for hospice, which normally means the patient will pass in 6 months or less(my dad with dementia passed at home on hospice) there were 5 of us to take care of him round the clock, with a max of 4-5 days)all we could take). She may need to be placed in a facility with a memory care unit
Is she Medicaid eligible? If so, try to get her in a Medicaid funded managed long term care program. You may be able to get a home health care aid to come to the house.",2022-01-02 10:59:49,ilikemermaids6969,rucj7j
Dementia,Finally financially secured care-taking my grandmother...,"Last 8 years, i have devoted myself to take care of my grandmother who was diagnose with dementia. During the hours of sleepless nights and tiresome days, i would only receive 2-3 hours of pay daily. i'm happy to state that she was finally confirmed full care, 40 hours weekly. I can finally get paid for the amount of work i actually put in. I honestly thought i would be forced to debt by taking care of my grandmother but now, im not to worried.","That's great news, what a relief, congrats!!  Sorry for the whole situation, but happy for you!   :)
Congratulations

From personal experience, it is well deserved. It is not an easy task

My siblings and I, 5 of us, took care of our dad at home 24/7 for 2 1/2 years

God bless you

First, congrats! Second, where are you so I can look this up? We definitely have no support like that here.",2022-01-02 08:09:08,MaiqTheUndying,ru9ai2
Dementia,Hospice meeting tomorrow,"Now that we FINALLY have an actual diagnosis showing vascular dementia, we have a few more options as far as help goes. A friend of mine went through the same things with her dad that we are with my grandmother, and she suggested calling hospice as they can help keep her comfortable as she slowly-but-progressively declines. While we have the meeting tomorrow, I’m still not completely sure what all to expect. Has anyone else gone this route as well? 

Her current condition is more bad days than good ones, she remembers me, my sister, my mom, my husband (all the people who are here regularly), but it’s hit or miss with most other people. She’s delusional to the point it can sometimes be detrimental (like waiting on her husband to come take her somewhere, even though shes not been married in 30+ years). Incontinent and is getting more and more unsteady every day. She’s also sleeping a LOT more when she finally falls asleep. But it could also take her nearly 48 hours to fall asleep. Luckily, that issue is getting less common, but we have to shake her awake to make sure she’s getting some food/fluids in her every so often.. 

It *almost* makes me miss the days where she wandered all over, getting into crap all over her house 😆","The when my father was deemed terminal … 6 months or so to live, we placed him in hospice … it was WONDERFUL. The nurses and chaplains that visited him were so helpful and loving. What was a 6 month prognosis, ended up lasting 5 days … Hospice began on a Tuesday and by Saturday night he had passed, peacefully … I was with him, holding his hand for his final breath and heartbeat …
I wanted to come back to update, hospice has already been a huge help, and we haven’t even had her on with them for two weeks yet. They have so many resources at hand and are on the ball with EVERYTHING. They did the intake process at around 2/3 pm and by 6pm that night, we had equipment, medicines, and supplies to make our life easier and hers more comfortable. 

Because we had the diagnosis of vascular dementia, it was pretty easy to be approved. She just needed referral paperwork filled out by her doctor (which hospice sent to them), and to stay with hospice services there just needs to be a provable decline in her health (which isn’t hard at all). They allow for 5 days of respite care every 30 days, and have volunteers that can come sit with her while we run to go so shopping/errands/etc. 

Such a huge help!",2022-01-02 05:18:16,GoodGodLlamas,ru6voy
Dementia,"Looking back, what were some early signs you initially brushed off?","I’m interested to hear about some of the less obvious / subtle signs there was something wrong.

EDIT: thank you for your responses! I’m concerned about my mother showing early signs of dementia, which runs on her side of the family. 

For example: mixing up ingredients for recipes she makes regularly, using expired ingredients, questionable hygiene habits, misplaced aggression and skepticism, general personality changes, inability to keep up during conversations, needing things repeated multiple times, loss of social graces and saying inappropriate things during conversation, and most prominent (I think) of all… the constant ‘stream of consciousness’ chatter. It’s never ending and so difficult to follow her as she just flows from one unrelated topic to another.","His constant repetition of a story he told like 5 mins earlier without any recollection of just having communicated the same story. Sometimes up to three times in one day. This was over 5 years ago.
Occasionally my dad would do something odd while driving, like turn the wrong way onto a street (thankfully a quiet one!) or stop at a green light.  And he’d swear he’d done the right thing, even as it was happening. These things all happened months apart, and his driving was fine the rest of the time.
Mail piling up

Bills getting forgotten (this one got bad before I legit caught it. Had to get 2 house out of foreclosure, and I took over as POA)

She was forgetting to turn off her car when she got to where she was going.

Spending more money, when she’d always been EXTREMELY frugal.
It started out as having to have something repeated 3-4 times, leaving milk out on the counter or leaving things in odd places (putting toilet paper in the freezer.) He would find it difficult to concentrate or focus on one task to completion when that had never been an issue. He would misplace something and accuse people who had been in the house of stealing the item(s) - he started losing interest in activities that he had been interested in before, became more quiet at family gatherings (where he had always been very talkative and animated.) We initially thought it was depression which is why we arranged for assessment with his primary care physician - Every person is a bit different but these were some of the early indicators.
She'd ask the same question like five times in the span of an hour, also weird things like calling me in early November to say she can't come to my place to celebrate Christmas because she's got a stomach ache or head ache and things like that. I chalked it up to her getting old and a little eccentric but then the diagnosis hit a few months later
About 5-7 years ago now (Mom is now mid-stage and I think the pandemic sped up the decline considerably):

Weirdness about retirement - a strange lack of clarity around what she wanted to do, and choosing volunteer options that didn't align with her interests. I still wonder if her decline would have been much slower had she chosen more appropriate options. 

Forgetting words or mis-using them. 

Not being able to handle basic tech - this was a really early indicator. She couldn't figure out an iPad, even though she'd used an iPhone for years.
The repetition of things, forgetting a certain word for example a banana and describes it in weird ways. Misplacing things, stopped cooking. Fixation on things.
The earliest thing was mom not wanting to do stuff. Just wanted to watch tv and not socialize.
Strange meal prep was a sign we missed.  They were never a wonderful cook, so it was easy to miss.  They started leaving out key ingredients, making sauces by adding everything in the fridge that was a condiment together, expecting a 10 lb turkey to feed 18 hungry big eater relatives.  That Thanksgiving was the wake up call that something was wrong.
Aggression. I couldn’t do anything right. Guarding the housework. Not letting me near my children unless it was approved by them, raising the children, undermining me, threatening me with the authorities if I didn’t do things. E.g leave the baby with her. Bullying. 

Looking back i wish i could have got help sooner.
Repeating the same story every time we spoke. (Not LITERALLY THE SAME one story through the years, but A same story, out of many stories. Hope that makes sense.)

Then repeating the same story or question multiple times per conversation. It got to the point where I would time how long it took her to repeat it again.

Restlessness. She couldn't stay in one spot or sit still. She would constantly be up moving around as if things needed to get done, yet nothing substantial was ever done. It was just fussing with stuff.

Fussing with stuff turned to attempting to organize and compartmentalize her stuff. Jewelry was moved into baggies of various sizes when she had a literal chest of drawers to store jewelry.

Things would go missing and she claimed people had stolen them. Later, when the items were found, she claimed the thieves broke in again and returned them. She was 100% convinced of this, and that was when I knew this was not just getting old and forgetful.

Things that were stolen were my grandmother's silver. It wasn't even a set, just a hodgepodge of various silver pieces, as if grandma had compiled various second hand incomplete sets into a collection in a case. We are not a family with valuable stuff.

Mom said her marriage certificate was stolen. Then returned. Then stolen again. This was her hill to die on. I found it in her jewelry chest after she went into a care facility.

At the doctor she would make seemingly normal statements of frustration. For example, she said she couldn't find things in the house because her husband moved them. The thing is, she didn't tell the doctor WHAT her husband moved, and he didn't ask.

Things that her husband moved: her purse, phone chargers, the bathroom, the laundry room. Her husband wouldn't elaborate on her statements either. He was either so deep in oblivion, denial, defense, or deferring to her pants wearing authority over him. 

There is frequently cover up and hiding symptoms in a misguided sense of RETAINING function and independence. Unfortunately, this results in lack of diagnosis or any hope of early intervention or meds that might actually help.

She started getting lost in her own home. Apparently from some of the defensive rants she would go on, lost enough to have accidents because she couldn't get to the bathroom in time.

There was about a year of fights and kicking her husband out, verbally divorcing him each night, then miserable without him later. She'd call at 2am to leave me voicemails disowning me. She'd blow up my phone when I was at work to berate me, presumably because the police had called me up there occasionally to intervene in the issues they were being called over to the house for. That was an awful period of time for everyone.

She absolutely refused any help, any one even stopping by the house to give home care or anything resembling therapy. Everything fell apart when she slipped and broke her hip almost a year ago.

Now she is in a facility and can't find her own room. She can be found wandering in others' rooms without pants looking for her bathroom - which is literally in her room. She sometimes comes up with weird contrived ways of saying she's thirsty when there will be a cup of water inches in front of her. When I hand it to her, she acts so surprised I found water.

It is so sad and crazy how she has declined so quickly.
Working excessively long hours, moving things in the house and arguing that it wasn't them when asked about it, pacing.
She would sometimes ask if it was a certain day of the week and be a day off.  For example she  might ask if it was Sunday and it was actually Saturday.
Trouble balancing her checkbook was the first big sign. Then she would say things that were out of character for her.
My dad quit doing a whole bunch of stuff, with vague or unconvincing reasons. He used to do volunteer work, but at a certain point just stopped doing it, saying he didn't have the time. (He was retired. He had plenty of time.) He also stopped his beekeeping hobby, saying it took too much time. (Same.) Plus he'd do weird stuff like take wrong turns on roads he'd driven on for twenty years, or ignore stop signs/stop lights, etc, but he didn't do it routinely so we initially wrote it off as momentary inattention. Used his computer less and less, but we just figured he was bored with his usual games. Turned out he was losing his ability to use computers. That kind of thing.
Psychotic episodes, undiagnosed bipolar disorder, financial problems and a change to a more flexible personality.
My mother just seemed befuddled at times, but she was quite good at hiding it from us and appearing ""on"" in dinner table conversations at the right moments. 

I think one thing to remember is that while it's important to notice specific signs, you should also be aware of the bias many family members have against accepting that dementia is taking place. We were always making excuses for Mum and saying ""it's not Alzheimers, it's just age"" (it actually wasn't Alzheimers, it was a bunch of intersecting factors).

I mean, when my mother started seeing her dead parents or small dogs running around, I knew there was something profound happening, but that took place almost five years ago. She actually passed away at the age of 80 just after Christmas and we had the funeral on New Years Eve, if you can believe it. But at that point she was bedridden, virtually mute, and given 24-hour at-home care by a lovely nurse who came in the morning and evenings and my father.
My dad forgot how to do things on the computer that he’d been doing for years and needed me to help him, forgot words, didn’t know how to spell words, couldn’t communicate properly (Almost lost his job several times because of these issues), couldn’t keep up with his work anymore (eventually this along with the previous got him fired after 20+ years at the company), didn’t understand some things we would say, significant behavioral changes... some might seem obvious now, but considering he was in his late 40’s/early 50’s at the time dementia didn’t even register as a possibility in the beginning.
We notice about 6 years ago with my dad. He was living alone so we probably missed a lot of smaller signs. We obviously didn't brush all of these off but they happened over the course of about a year.

Many of the things you said; repeated stories within the same conversation, inappropriate, often muttering to himself. Bills piling up, meat rotting in the fridge and general confusion on what food goes in the fridge/how long, moved the grill and cooked inside a closed garage (yikes!), couple driving instances were he did something borderline dangerous, co-workers noticing his absent-mindedness and inability to remember appointments, inability to remember new members of the family including grandchildren, DRINKING to excess and injuring himself as a result, not remembering drinking or understanding his hangover, sudden inability to use technology he's used for years.
My dad knocking on my door and bawling his eyes out on my couch. My huge, manly man dad….bawling his eyes out.

Besides that, finding a ton of random electrical cords cut and then toed together.  Literally so many cords with their ends cut off. That started a good few years before we realized something was actually wrong.
My mother making the pumpkin pies for a neighborhood Thanksgiving feast - and using salt instead of sugar. Another sign was her saying ""I'll have the same thing"" when she and Dad would go out to eat. She couldn't figure out the menu and it took over a year of that going on before we realized it.
My dad had a small retirement business.  It was a service business involving classic cars which were a lifelong hobby of his and he had decades of experience with cars as a collector, rebuilder, etc.  I first realized the decline when he had a client who wanted him to do consulting work related to a collection of 30 cars.  This was the biggest deal he had ever won through this business.  The report was due before Christmas but I discovered he was struggling, missed the deadline, so I got involved to help him. Between my brother and I we finally were able to fix and complete the project but it was several weeks late.  He was a deep expert in this field so could “fake” it for a while but couldn’t handle the administrative and business side, nor could he really get the reports produced in a professional manner.  My son ended up helping him and now owns the business.
Wow. All of the above. A lot of these replies seem to be stories of ongoing decline rather than problems that were initially overlooked. But man they are so familiar.
The first time my wife came home from work and said her new boss told her she needs to move on because she is forgetting things was the first indication to me. 
She did not agree but I now see that she developed a lengthy and complex note taking and calendar scheme that covered up her problem for some time.
She uses it to this day. It's her safety net.
I kick myself every time I go there, makes me feel I failed my wife for disregarding stuff with her mother.

1 The maid is stealing from me (almost got the maid in trouble)
2 Eventually she got into arguments with neighbors she was friends for a long time, like all of them and stopped talking to them.
3 Constantly losing her keys.
4 Telling us weird stories from next door guy
5 House filthy
6 When we would stay there she was up walking around very late at nights.
7 Obsessed about a couple of cats she had (like looking for them every couple of minutes)

1 through 4 I kept dismissing to old age
5 I thought she wasn't that tidy to start with and I was thinking getting old
6 & 7 we noticed to late because she lived a few hours away.

Now as I'm getting older I'm paying attention to my wife behavior to see if I catch any signs which to be honest causes me some anxiety from time to time.
My mom would ask me if I’d seen a specific episode of her favorite show before, even though she watched the show constantly and I would sit with her to watch it often. I didn’t connect the dots then but now I understand.
Just becoming incredibly passive. The phone rang my parent's house and I answered. Normally my Dad would come trotting through, looking at me quizzically and whispering 'who is it?' This time though, he shuffled into the room, sat on the sofa like a little boy and gave me a distant smile, like he'd forgotten where he was. It was a very striking change.
My mom's high degree of anxiety over everyday things.

She'd get so worked up because she would second guess herself over something she'd done many times before. She also began misremembering a lot of details about the past, as well. She also stopped paying much attention to the day and time, getting up at 1 am (thinking it was 7 am). 

Now she's at mid-stage and progressing somewhat quickly. I remember some odd things from between 4-6 years ago, and think, ""Yep. That was dementia sneaking up on us.""
My dad kept double-booking us. We would make plans to see him only to find out at the last minute that he had made plans with someone else. Also, every time I called her was having ""serious problems with his computer."" He was being scammed but I just thought he had downloaded viruses.
For her, it was hard because she has ALWAYS been eccentric and stubborn. even in her 40s, she frequently would read something in the newspaper or hear from a friend, and start making actual financial and life decisions based on her memory of that info without ever looking into it more, or getting contact for professionals, or even clipping it from the page to save it! But then when she got older, a lot was attributed to her blindness (macular degeneration) as… combined with stubbornness. We assumed she heard or saw things incorrectly originally, but remembered that image accurately. Like 4 years ago for example we were at brunch and she poured too much milk into her coffee cup beyond overflow, when we tried to fix it and avoid additional spilling, she said “no, i like it like that!”

on that point. please do get your mom screened for hearing loss. Because unaddressed hearing loss WILL accelerate dementia. If they can’t (or must work too hard to) participate in conversation. they just socially check out and stop engaging in interesting conversation. 


within the last 10 years… Insistently taking on projects (investments aka scams) for which she was way in over her head… and which had massive legal and financial obligations and consequences. For example she wrestled the guardianship and special needs trusteeship for a disabled distant cousin who lived in a different state. At this point she was already pretty blind, there was no way she could follow up on all the paperwork obligations.

Clinging onto “power” with the medical/legal/financial affairs of her disabled son, and then mucking it up: repeatedly scheduling doctors appointments and never writing it down and never attending. Or if she did attend, she never wrote down what the doctor said or told other family who the doctor was. Saying they could pry POA from her dead hands (even though POA is the person’s choice, they can freely update it the POA doesn’t hand it over).

in 2012, we were visiting friends standing in front of their house, and the lady was backing up her SUV down the driveway. My grandmother (blind) stepped into the path, my mom instinctively pulled her back, grandma smacked her hand away and kept on forward.
Mom asked: Who's things are on all my shelves-- your brother tried to tell me they are mine!? Mom regularly cooked a chicken and made meals from it for a week-- without refrigerating it-- and then became mysteriously ill for a month (even missed Christmas last year with us due to stomach ailment we couldn't figure out). Wetting her bed due to UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) and she constantly washed her sheets and the bath towels she used to mop it up but never sought treatment, help, nor used  diapers.  Still discovering behaviors and we are with her 24/7 for the last 6 (long) months.

Dementia,I’m scared,"My Pop-Pop (mid-late 60s) is showing early signs of dementia. He is constantly loosing things, he’s snapping at people and getting angry and sad easily, he’s starting to forget many things, he acts way differently than he used to,  and he sometimes struggles to form sentences.

This is scaring me because I don’t know if I’m mentally ready to lose him (wow that sounds really selfish now that I think about it). Growing up without a father meant that he was one of the only male influences in my life. He taught me so much. Hearing him starting to lose that personality that he had when I was younger is just heart breaking. He’s even told me what to do when he does die and he said he wants me to have his Vietnam medals and my dad’s old trophies from High school when he dies. I have to hold back tears every time because I just hate hearing him ramble on about how it’s getting to be “his time”. 

It seems as if he’s accepted his fate and is ready to go. That makes it hurt even more seeing him so accepting of what’s happening to him

It’s heartbreaking seeing the man he’s turned into. He freaks out more often, he talks frequently about his own death, and he refuses no matter how much I beg him to go to the doctor.  

I’m scared man. I just hope he’s ok.","Should I be concerned that my family is saying these things about me
hey, totally normal to feel overwhelmed and not-ready to lose him, either mentally or physically — i don’t think anyone ever is ready, to be honest. it’s hard, and as much as i wish i could say it will get easier… well it’ll go back and forth, but dementia is *hard* no two ways about it. i’m sorry you and your family are going through this — and as a fellow absentee-father-haver whose grandfather was one of the only constant male figures in my life, i get it completely. the only real comfort in all of this is that you’re not alone and you have a community of support behind you.

have you tried talking to other family members about getting him to see a doctor? you could also always schedule the appointment with a neurologist and tell him it’s just a checkup, but if he’s still in the early stages, that could be difficult. in any case, i think you’re definitely right in trying to get him to see a doctor — generally some of the more difficult symptoms can improve with treatment, and you might feel like some of him is “back,” as well as him feeling more at ease.

lastly… i know it’s a difficult conversation that you’re not ready for, but i would urge you to listen carefully and engage with him when he talks about his eventual passing. i understand how hard that is to do when you don’t want to think about it at all, but it will be *so* much harder if the disease progresses and you don’t know as much as possible about what he wanted and how he feels. i get the sense that he’s trying to get you all acquainted with the idea early on so that it’s less of a blow when it does happen — indulge him in that, even though it will be hard. additionally, as scary as it is for you to think about his death, it is also probably very scary for him to think about dying himself — i think talking openly and honestly about it while he’s still here could be very positive and therapeutic for you both in the long run. you might even see an improvement in his depression if he has an outlet to get his feelings about his death out through. as hard as it is, i think it’s very fortunate that he seems to be so open about it, because it’s an incredibly important thing to talk about that’s *much* more difficult to talk about with someone who doesn’t want to acknowledge their own mortality.

obviously, talk about what you can, when you can — by no means would i suggest you have a conversation about death that you aren’t emotionally prepared to handle! don’t sacrifice your own mental well-being, but i would gently advise you to help your grandfather out by gradually acquainting yourself with death and trying to be more receptive to him wanting to talk about it — it’s a heavy, emotional thing, but i find that talking about it with others makes the load a bit lighter for everyone.

if nothing else, good luck and best wishes to you, pop-pop, and the rest of the family ♥️♥️♥️
Should you be concerned that your profile name makes it pretty hard to respond to ?
Its totally normal to feel scared, but please try to not let your fear get in the way. Please cherish your time with him. Time moves fairly quickly.",2022-01-02 04:23:12,CumGuzzler714,ru64x7
Dementia,Need some advice,"I don’t know if my dad has dementia, but he’s survived several brain tumors that have caused memory issues and degrading cognitive functions over the past years. For instance I have to remind him to swallow his food, or sometimes he’ll take a sip of water and it sits in his mouth for several minutes until I remind him.  He loses track of time and sometimes stays awake until 6am and gets heavily disoriented if he takes a nap. He’s left the stove fire on once and forgot while watching TV. 

I work full time and have hired homecare to watch him during the week, but on the weekend I drive over to take care of him. In the beginning I was patient, but I feel myself becoming more and more frustrated and I feel like a horrible person because of it. 

My question that I need help with is that my dad does irregular things constantly that I keep reminding him over and over about, like not to use too much toilet paper (he has clogged the toilet several times and the landlord was super close to kicking him out). He’ll use 5 stacked paper plates to heat up a single muffin.

Do I stop reminding him not to do these things? I feel like I’ve become a nag and it doesn’t seem like he remembers any of it. Everytime I tell him not to do it, he just nods and says okay, then does it again an hour later. 

I don’t want to be a nag and I was hoping that repetition might help, but at this point do I just give up and let him do whatever he wants and clean up after him? Is letting him just do his thing better than constantly reminding him? 

Any insight would be much appreciated.","How old are you? The situation described is a medical emergency. Are there any adults around that can help you?
You have gotten a lot of good advice. I just wanted to chime in as someone working with brain (I'm a neuroscientist originally and about halfway through med school as well).

The brain tumors will have affected his cognition. It's not clear to me what sort of tumors you are talking about, where they were or if they were removed surgically. This is actually pretty relevant to his prognosis.

You dad might have dementia, but it's hard to know for sure. Brain trauma can lead to symptoms very similar to dementia, and physiologically speaking some of the changes in the brain are extremely similar. 

There is likely no use in reminding him. You would need to secure your house in a way that these things can't happen - only leave enough toilet paper out, don't allow him to use dangerous equipment (disable oven/microwave when you're not around). These should be temporary measures until you are able to get him into permanent care.
Hello! I just wanted to tell you that if you  need support through this process, please message me. I have been through the same situation personally and professionally. It is so overwhelming and the unknown is terrifying. Please do not let anyone make you feel as if you aren't doing the right things. Sometimes people forget that every person and situation is different and we all have different levels of experience and support. 

You have homecare in place already but you did not mention the hours they were working - you did say he sometimes stays up all night. Is there someone to watch him at night? How many hours a week is homecare in? Homecare can absolutely work in most situations, the important part is to have his needs assessed so you can ensure the right amount of care is given. Nursing care/assisted living have many levels of care available and the costs vary of course depending on where you are. I am in Canada so it may be a much different system than you have. If he is a veteran there are also other options for coverage and support. The first step as it has already been mentioned is to contact social services and his physician to get the ball rolling on a needs assessment and more help for you.

There are specific interventions that you can put in place to ensure safety - I have had to use childproofing measures in my own personal experience - I am more than happy to provide you with any help that I possibly can. I was 19 when I first had to navigate this process on a personal level and I was overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. I am available anytime you need to talk, share information, vent etc. Please know that you are not alone.
It’s called pouching in the uk he may need a referral to speech and language that  Would assess swallowing and they could prescribe thickener to put in his drinks snd recommend small bite size or purred food . 
If you are happy enough to have him with carers in the week laminate posters with reminders of what he has to do and place them in the area where he will see them . 
Hope it works out",2022-01-01 21:59:48,taikoturtle,rtztyi
Dementia,Cardiac catheterization for dementia patient?,"They tried to do cardiac catheterization on my mother a week and a half ago but she didn’t cooperate, and I wasn’t allowed in the hospital to try to calm her down because our local hospital has outlawed visitors due to high covid rates in the area.

My mother needs a cardiac catheterization procedure. I would like her to have this for her quality of life. They want to try again in two months.

Had anyone here had the same issue?","How bad is your mother's dementia and how old is she? My dad had dementia and each year is PSA was up. It took a pretty good jump and his doctor said he probably had prostate cancer.  We refused a biopsy because of his dementia and would not treat if he had it. We weighed the quality of life he had vs going thru the process of even getting him thru a biopsy during covid. He had a brief hospital stay just prior to covid and one of us stayed with him 24/7, so he had a familiar voice and face, but he still had to be dosed with ativan to call him down

He passed June 5th at 90, at home on hospice. We took care of him 24/7 for 2 1/2 years
I would not prolong the life of my parents, both of whom have dementia. Main focus is emotional and physical comfort now.
Personally, I would not allow that type of procedure on my husband. I would not do anything which would prolong his life. Did you two have any discussions about what she would want before she got sick? Does she have a living will or anything to give you direction?
My mom had a cardiac cath procedure right around the time that she was beginning to show a few mild signs of dementia. This was December 2019 and she was 73 at the time. She had not been diagnosed with dementia prior to the procedure; however the stress of the surgery significantly exacerbated the dementia symptoms. She left the hospital a different person, and she never really improved, personality or cognitive-wise. But it did correct her cardiac/breathing issues. Her dementia progressed very quickly after the procedure; she passed about 1.5 years after, in May 2021. Her cause of death was dementia and failure to thrive - nothing directly cardiac related. 

I would talk to the doctors and weigh the pros and cons of both the cardiac piece and the dementia piece. I think it’s important not to undervalue the emotional and cognitive stress that the surgery may put on your mom. But, I also don’t want you to think that my mom’s story is what will happen for your mom.  You know your mom the best, and you know what she needs - you’ll make the best decision for her ultimately ❤️",2022-01-01 19:14:05,Apprehensive_Goal811,rtwjwl
Dementia,New Body Wash (Funny),"So my stepdad has recently been progressing from mild dementia and has a difficult time reading and understanding labels. We share the tub/shower in my bathroom as the other 2 are just half baths, I use more products than my stepfather so I keep mine in a caddy in the shower. My mom will set up his towel and clean clothes in the bathroom for him prior to his shower and will show him where his shampoo and body wash is before he gets in the shower. About 3 weeks ago my stepfather had a shower and later told my mom he really liked the new body wash that was in the tub. My mom was a bit confused by that as he has been using the same container of body wash for a month and it is still half full. She asked him what kind of body wash it was and he said it was in a ""pretty"" purple bottle, I was in the room when he told her and I broke down laughing. The new body wash he was using is my feminine hygiene wash.

His body wash is now in a separate caddy with a big R on it (first initial of his name) lol","My funny story from yesterday:
My grandmother was looking at a calendar that she has just received of rescued draft horses. She keeps reading ""little Giants"" instead of Gentle Giants. I've corrected her a few times, others let her say it. After the last correction, she went to the next page and read it as ""lentil Giants."" I laughed to myself at that.
Dementia sucks, but somedays it's funny. My dad had dementia. One of my favorites, we went to a drive thru car wash. First I left my window down, so he asked what the hell was I thinking and we laughed. About half way thru, he said he hadda pee. I said dad, just go in your underwear(diaper), he started cracking up and said he already did!!

Dementia sucks, but there are some funny moments
My mom's funniest thing is using random words. A few years ago I made brownies and she said she hoped they weren't dry. She took a bite and said, ""They aren't dry. They're...remote control!)",2022-01-01 19:12:03,JenFigs,rtwidj
Dementia,I feel guilty for having a better life,My dad has dementia and he is bedridden. My mom is one of my father's caregivers. She works a full time job and takes care of him too. I work a full time job far from home so I only visited on weekends and holidays. I feel bad because I know my mom has a lot on her plate and I can't do anything to help. I feel guilty because I'm having fun and living life and she is at home in a prison.,"Don't feel bad, you say you go home on the weekends so you are helping your mom by just being there.

You may already be doing this, but if your not you can also help your mom tremendously by taking care of your dad when you visit.  Take care of him for one day hang out with him, feed him, give him a bath, etc.  To give your mom the day off so to speak.  It'll help her very much. 

I've learned it's a team effort when it comes to taking care of a loved one with dementia. Collectively it all helps.
I agree with giving your mom a break by doing some caregiving yourself. Depending on your financial situation, it would also be a big help to hire a professional for a few hours during the week.
Why don't you do some research and see if there is a senior center near their home, many have adult day care programs.  Are you financially able to help?  If yes, then hire someone to come in and help her once or twice a week, or cook up some meals that can be warmed up later. Maybe she would appreciate a house cleaner once a week? When you visit do you take over his care so she can have time to herself?  If not then it is time to start doing that for her.
Can she afford to hire a person to come in and help a few hours a day to give her a break?
I went through the same situation. My dad was my mom's primary caregiver and had someone coming in a few hours a day.  I went on weekends. I always felt like I wasn't doing enough, but Dad always said he could not have taken care of her without my help. 

Your being there is a great help. You offer the opportunity for your mom to get out on the weekends and do something that she enjoys; you give her real conversation when you are there.  These are the things my dad expressed the most appreciation for.

Other things I did -

Once I realized how important the conversation was for him, I called Dad daily.  He passed away a year ago and I still miss those calls. 

I cooked for them as often as I could, or took them prepared meals that could be frozen and pulled out on rough days.

A couple of times I was able to convince him to take a week off to visit family or friends. I took time off work to take care of mom while he was away. It took a lot to get him to agree, but it was really good for him.
I completely understand this guilt. It’s so hard and so so taxing. So mentally straining to be constantly feeling the guilt.
His disease cannot run your life. You are your own person. He once was too. Him and your mum would not want your wasting your life worrying about them. Go out and live whilst you can!!",2022-01-01 18:53:48,nothingtofind29,rtw4bx
Dementia,Dad refusing to go to pain doctor,"I’m editing this because I talk too much. 

Have you ever gone to appt for the person with dementia without them? They have all his permissions and I’ve been with him to appointments. He is agitated and is refusing to go on Monday, but wants me to go. Is this even possible?

Eta: dad has agreed to go with me if I do all the talking! It’s a start.","Sorry you're going through this but you can't go for him. My mom's Dr would let me message her as much as I needed but when it was appointment time, my mom had to be there. My mom would always defer questions to me and that was fine. Is it possible to do a phone or video appointment?
So sorry, that's hard - poor dad!   I suppose at least for the moment, drop mentioning it, Monday is still another day away, no use being agitated & anxious ahead of time.   Idk, can you call yr area dementia .org, they have plenty ideas & experience with this issue.   I suppose you could go yrself & speak with the doc about the concerns re : disastrous experience, but sure, dad will have to see the doc again at some point.   Idk, so sorry, best of luck!
I think he should be able to choose whether he wants to continue wit the pain center or not.  I think many times treating docs just start trying this and that with the belief they are helping their patient but maybe the patient doesn't want the help.  Why put him through additional stress and agitation, let him stop going. Maybe he will change his mind in the future maybe not, but allow him the grace to have some control over what happens to him,
You can't go to the appointment alone. If you show up alone without warning them in advance be prepared to pay a cancellation fee or pay for the entire visit out of your own pocket since they can't bill his insurance if he's not there. Remember, you are dealing with a person with dementia.  He has impaired judgement. Don't try to follow his nonsensical plans. If he refuses to go and it's non critical, then you cancel. If it's essential that he goes, then don't discuss the appointment ahead of time and get him in the car and drive him there. Telehealth visits might be an option in the future if the doctor only needs to talk with you two.",2022-01-01 17:25:11,jackie0h_,rtu8vv

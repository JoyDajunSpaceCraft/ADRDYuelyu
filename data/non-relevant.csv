Tracking devices for dementia .,0
Hi all .,0
"My grandfather is  beginning to show the first signs of dementia , and he ’s always been sort of ... difficult as it is .  ",0
Let ’s leave it at that .  ,0
He still drives .  ,0
Resources for long - term care,0
"Hello friends , my dad has Alzheimer 's and seems to be advancing pretty rapidly .",0
My mom has been my dad 's caretaker,0
but I know it 's burning her out .,0
I've seen plenty of watches but my biggest concern with any kind of wearable is getting him to wear it .,0
It doesn't help much if he walks away without the watch or other wearable on .,0
I've seen the tracking soles for shoes but it needs charging almost everyday .,0
Thoughts on what works well and how to get them to wear it ?,0
The other thing I'm looking for guidance on is how to find out what kind of assistance my parents qualify for .,0
My dad was a 9/11 first responder and is part of the long - term study,0
so I've asked my mom to mention it at his next check - up .,0
But I'm curious about who I should contact to get more info on financial assistance for long - term care .,0
Thank you in advance !,0
My sweet honey,0
A few days ago I came home to find that my sweet honey had passed away .,0
4 wonderful years we shared together .,0
4 short years when we planned on having forever .,0
When Dave and I met things were very casual and fun .,0
We had both been hurt in the past and were not looking to rush into anything .,0
We instantly hit it off .,0
"I had never laughed so hard , smiled so much or been so happy before .",0
Every second I spent with him the more I realized that what we had would be special .,0
Dave was a type 1 diabetic for over 10years when we first met .,0
I knew very little about the disease but quickly became quit the expert .,0
Our relationship blossomed and we both realized that we would never be apart .,0
It was so natural .,0
We fit so well together,0
and I told him he was my forever,0
and he told me I was his “ end goal ” .,0
He met my 4 year old son and the two of them hit it off and instantly became buddies .,0
We were a little family .,0
"As our relationship blossomed , unfortunately so did Daves illness .",0
His organs began to fail and he started dialysis 3 days a week while waiting for a transplant .,0
"Even with all the hospital trips , dialysis , and sickness we still had each other .",0
And we made each other laugh .,0
Even in the darkest times .,0
We were going to get through it .,0
"Last March , Dave got the call we had been waiting for .",0
They had a kidney and pancreas for him .,0
"Even though we were scared because the world was in the middle of a pandemic , we knew this was his 2nd chance .",0
The surgery was a success and within 4 weeks he was home recovering with me .,0
We spent a WONDERFUL 8 months living together .,0
He grew stronger every day .,0
It was so nice to not have to worry about sugars or dialysis .,0
Unfortunately this took a turn for the worse about a month ago .,0
He developed phenomena and spent the last 3 weeks in the hospital .,0
His body fought off the illness but also started to fight the new organs that didn’t really belong there .,0
The pancreas was able to be saved but the kidney was stubborn and would not wake back up .,0
I picked him up from the hospital Wednesday and was so happy to have him home .,0
"Even though he had to start dialysis again , we were positive that we would get through this together .",0
Just another road block,0
but we would get through it like everything else .,0
We were so strong .,0
So so strong .,0
Never in 4 years did we fight or argue .,0
We even talked about celebrating him being home by getting sized for rings .,0
We planned on buying a home together this summer .,0
So many plans .....,0
and everything was just taken away .,0
I came home from work Thursday and found him in bed .,0
He was gone .,0
His beautiful blue eyes were open but no light was left in there .,0
I tried to save him .,0
I did CPR until the paramedics arrived and they took over when they got there ....,0
but he was gone .,0
He had passed a few hours before .,0
"Although he fought like hell , his body was just tired .",0
My sweet Dave .,0
I love you so very much .,0
You are and will forever be my person .,0
You made me so happy and although you are not here you will always be in my heart .,0
Always .,0
"I ordered your ring , exactly like you said you had wanted and will wear it around my neck until we meet again .",0
I love you honey .,0
Always,0
Elderly Tracker,0
Good afternoon !,0
He can’t remember anyone ’s phone numbers or our home address and he ’s worried that he will be forgotten somewhere .,0
The likelihood of this happening is extremely rare since he is not mobile and basically wheelchair ridden .,0
I printed multiple business cards with emergency phone numbers and our home address for him to carry .,0
He also has an iPhone and he can tell Siri to call people,0
but he,0
doesn’t think he’ll have his phone on him for whatever reason since it ’s,0
basically just to yell at Siri and ask her questions,0
Thanks in advance !,0
Tech recommendations for assisted living,0
My grandmother is in an assisted living facility .,0
I couldn’t say what stage of dementia,0
she ’s,0
at,0
but it has been ongoing struggling for family to communicate with her due to COVID .,0
Damn you Apple !,0
I wouldn’t care if I had to travel to an authorized Apple store to verify with my POA that remote access is for my mom ’s devices .,0
"But I’m sick of the two - factor authenticator and other update bullshit that skyrockets her anxiety and it never fails , it happens after the regular assisted living staff have left for the evening .",0
Yes I have auto updates enabled which works consistently for apps but not software updates .,0
SNL was spot on with their Amazon Echo Silver skit ! Rant over !,0
What tech should I get to keep dad safe ?,0
Granny cam ?,0
Alexa / Google device ? ?,0
Dad is coming home in 2 days after almost two months in the hospital .,0
"He is going against everyone 's advice and not moving into the main building where there is ample care , so what tech should I be looking for ?",0
"For example , I have young children , and we are now quarantining flowing exposure to a positive case at school for the next two weeks .",0
"I've got my eye on a "" seniors "" clock that displays the time , date   and what part of the day",0
Do I just get a video baby monitor ?,0
Something different ?,0
"I remember seeing old posts over a year ago about doing this , wondering how those systems are working for others .",0
Thanks everyone .,0
"Guys , my mom is in such a horrible situation and I’m at a total loss ...",0
Has anyone had any experience talking to the Alzheimer ’s Association ?,0
Hey y’all .,0
"My mom is in the moderate level of Alzheimer ’s , creeping closer into the severe .",0
"It ’s been a year since her diagnosis , but several years of losing cognitive function after suffering the trauma of breaking her femur and the process of going under anesthesia for surgery .",0
"Quick context of her life : my dad left when I was 7 , I’m now 35 .",0
"I have 4 older siblings , with the oldest 11 years my senior .",0
"Mom didn’t get remarried until about 9 years ago , after we were all married & moved out / away .",0
She married the widower of a woman she was very close friends with for 30 + years ...,0
she had NEVER shown any interest in being with anyone my whole life after my dad .,0
She was more interested in being involved with me and,0
my siblings lives .,0
Classic selfless single mother .,0
"But when her friend died suddenly a decade or so ago , the widower started coming around and wanting to spend time with my mom .",0
She resisted it SO HARD .,0
But he was persistent and eventually “ won her over ” .,0
I think she thought it would be wrong to get with her late friend ’s husband .,0
"My mom is also the classic good Catholic girl ; had only ever been with my dad , etc .",0
And that Catholic guilt & worrying what other people would think made her very hesitant to start dating him .,0
"So , in my opinion , her choice to finally marry him was a combination of fear and security .",0
My mom always struggled with money .,0
"Worked 3 jobs , a total hustler , but always in debt because she wanted to give all us kids everything .",0
She ’s never been fully mentally strong and healthy .,0
"Depression & anxiety , that I used to think was just caused by my dad cheating & leaving her , but I’ve come to realize is just ever - present in her family history and upbringing .",0
"Nevertheless , she thought “ wow , this is a nice man that wants to be with me , who showers me with gifts and takes me on fancy trips , and who seems really happy and funny and fun — surely this can’t be a bad thing to have financial stability and to be with someone who will take care of me , to have companionship , etc . ”",0
"And honestly , for the first 4ish years it was great .",0
The first time in my life I wasn’t just worried about my mom and the fact that she was alone and didn’t have anyone to count on ( besides her kids ) .,0
Fast forward to now .,0
Her husband has lost more and more of his hearing - which has been a big frustration for both of them in communicating .,0
But sometimes I think he exaggerates and uses it as an excuse .,0
Because oftentimes he will hear things from other people but have to shout “,0
What ? ! ”,0
"when it ’s my mom who is talking .... But long story short , he is a terrible , HORRIBLE caregiver .",0
He’ll admit it too .,0
But he does NOTHING to fix it .,0
"For over a year now , my sisters and I have been giving him books , sending him resources , suggesting things to make his life easier ...",0
"guys , I can’t stress enough to you how dense this man is .",0
He ’s 74 and a boomer to his core .,0
His emotional intelligence is non - existent .,0
Once at the doctors office he & I were talking to a nurse and a social worker in a room away from my mom,0
and he went into this thing about how he worked for Lockheed his whole life and how he is a “ problem - solver ” —,0
and he just can’t get my mom to realize what is happening ; how much he has to repeat things and how frustrating all her “ crazy ” behaviors are ; and wanted them to tell him “ how to make her understand what ’s going on with her ” ....,0
the nurses and I looked at each other curiously,0
and we all essentially told him “ you can’t do anything .,0
"YOU have to adjust , YOU have to change YOUR behavior . ”",0
"He just stared blankly like “ no , I don’t accept this answer .",0
"You women are idiots , so I guess I’ll have to figure it out myself . ”",0
"He doesn’t read the books , he doesn’t talk to anyone about his feelings .",0
He just blows up at my mom .,0
"Recently , a friend of my moms was on the phone (",0
"mom must’ve called or picked up & not realize someone was there , put the phone down without hanging it up ) and this woman heard my mom ’s husband YELLING at her .",0
Something like “ You’re driving me crazy today !,0
CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY ! ”,0
"I’ve heard him do it too , when I’m in town and stay at their house .",0
He is mean .,0
Very cold and impatient .,0
"Don’t get me wrong , my mom can be mean too .",0
But it ’s not her fault anymore .,0
She ’s only mean when she feels out of control in a situation .,0
She ’s lovely when I’m there,0
and she feels taken care of and loved .,0
"He ’s not kind to her , not affectionate .",0
"He used to leave her alone at home constantly , even though my sisters and I repeatedly asked him not to .",0
He’d,0
drive 2 hours to go to the casino and just not tell anyone .,0
"And before you ask , no he ’s not in serious cognitive decline .",0
He still works and does complicated financial stuff and all that .,0
"He ’s not an idiot in that sense , just when it comes to thinking about anyone but himself .",0
The other day he lost her AT,0
THE DOCTOR ’S OFFICE .,0
"Not the brain doc , but apparently they",0
"didn’t know she had dementia and let her leave to go find him , since he couldn’t come in and was waiting in the lobby .",0
After an hour he finally went to look for her and found her talking to the valet trying to find her car .,0
She hasn’t driven in 2 years probably .,0
"We had a conference call with her brain doc a few days ago , to go over her new test results .",0
"At one point he ( the husband ) was talking directly to my mom , trying to explain why it was important to have home Heath care come in",0
( she HATES it ) and why they were saying she needs 24/7 care .,0
"It was great because he spoke to her exactly as he always does - not yelling , but very curt and uncompassionate .",0
"It was amazing because after he was done talking , the doc / nurse / social worker all started talking to him about learning how to communicate with her better , suggested all the same resources we’ve been telling him about for a year .",0
I don’t think it mattered though .,0
He ’s not gon na change .,0
It was like pulling teeth to get him to start having home health care come in .,0
"He only started having someone come like a month ago , after my sisters found out about him yelling at her while the family friend heard .",0
It ’s only a few hours a week,0
and it ’s,0
basically just so he can leave the house .,0
When he ’s home,0
"he ’s rarely even in the same room with her , and",0
when he is it ’s not for her benefit or anything .,0
He can’t remember to give her medication everyday .,0
"I got him a $ 100 auto pill box thing , did everything I could to get him started with it .",0
"I found it in its original box , in the garage with other crap",0
they don’t use .,0
"Here ’s a quick list of all the things I’ve tried to implement to make my mom as healthy as possible AND to make his life easier , all of which he has either stopped after I leave or never started in the first place : -auto pill box",0
-cod liver oil capsules,0
"-eating mushrooms , drinking green tea , taking tumeric w / black pepper in a capsule ( all just good for general brain health )",0
"-daily walks with her dog , they live super close to a few parks too .",0
-getting,0
a sleep apnea machine,0
"so she sleeps better , which is REALLY important for brain health ...",0
sleep is like the brains way to flush out all the garbage that builds up everyday .,0
-having a white board by her bed where she looks everyday to remind her of things .,0
"-simplifying their home which is WAY too cluttered , simplifying the phones and TV setup so she can easily use .",0
It fucking never works when I’m there .,0
-letting,0
her go to therapy,0
so she can at least talk to someone .,0
We have a therapist that many of us have seen at different points and who is just an overall comforting presence .,0
But he thinks it ’s,0
a waste since she won’t remember .,0
-having,0
"a good pharmacologist managing her medications , since no one seems to be doing it regularly enough — she needs to be getting meds on time",0
"yes , but she also needs to be on the right combination of meds and have them monitored more regularly so",0
at least THAT part isn’t hurting more than helping ...,0
There is an amazing doc that could do this about 4 minutes from their house .,0
"-oh , and she has this little dog that she absolutely adores .",0
Her husband is constantly giving it people food .,0
I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve explained to him that he can’t do that .,0
The dog weighs probably 9lbs .,0
It ’s a teeny tiny little lap dog .,0
"He feeds it cheese , leftover steak or chicken from whatever restaurant they went to the night before , and most recently I observed him feeding the dog a Twinkie .",0
.....,0
This is what we’re dealing with .,0
"A Fox News consuming , truth - denying , stubborn , arrogant ( and honestly , pretty damn racist ) MORON who simply refuses to take any of us seriously .",0
"And just to connect the racism to how it effects my mom , he said some incredibly racist things to my mom ’s first home health care nurse .",0
Sisters were there to hear and were mortified .,0
I know HHC people are not gon na let stuff like that interfere with the care they give,0
but jfc,0
....,0
I want the people who are taking care of my mom to be treated with respect too .,0
Bottom line :,0
I don’t think he loves her nor cares about what happens to her .,0
"He doesn’t give her any more time and thought than he absolutely has to , and even then it ’s not enough .",0
"She calls me or my sisters or my brothers 10 times a day , just begging us to help her .",0
She thinks she can fix it herself by being different .,0
She doesn’t understand that she can’t .,0
And he won’t listen or adapt .,0
I know she doesn’t wanna be married to him anymore if it continues as it is .,0
He would basically have to be a totally different person for her to be happy with him .,0
"She can’t remember something you said 5 minutes ago , but she is not forgetting how shitty her husband makes her feel .",0
"Emotional memory goes last , and it ’s just seems clear to me that whatever is broken in their relationship is unfixable , unless there ’s a miracle .",0
"Or that their relationship was superficial from both sides , and now the husband is just done with her bc all he wanted was someone to take care of him after he lost his wife of 40 years .",0
"Whatever it is , I just don’t think their 9 years together is enough to carry them through to the end .",0
I think he ’s done .,0
I just wish he’d admit it and let us take care of her .,0
I really,0
"don’t think a real divorce is necessary or even a good idea at all — I’d be happy to help take care of her as much as I can , but",0
I can’t afford all that I’d need to do it all .,0
"My best ideas right now are just to go home and get her , bring her to my house to stay for a bit and see what happens .",0
Or for her to go stay with either of my two sisters who live close to her .,0
"But they say as soon as she leaves the house , even for a quick errand , she just wants to go home .",0
:/,0
"I live 4.5 hours from her , but my living situation is ideal",0
I think .,0
"35 acres , beautiful outdoors and lots of animals , healthy fresh food , and no children of my own .",0
"I’m here basically all the time , we’re far away from the busy road .",0
My husband is a wonderful cook .,0
My sisters & brothers all have kids .,0
3 are nearby her,0
but the 2nd brother is across the country .,0
Ugh ....,0
it ’s just awful,0
y’all .,0
I don’t know what the right thing to do is .,0
I feel like I’ve tried everything .,0
Who do I call and talk to ?,0
Who knows what to do when the person with dementia has a spouse who doesn’t seem to give a shit about them ?,0
"I’ve thought about adult protective services , but what does that even do ?",0
I don’t want them to take my mom or anything .,0
"If she is forced to move into a facility , she will absolutely give up the will to live .",0
One of her sisters died a few years back — same thing .,0
But her daughter ( my cousin ) put her in a home that was hours away from their family .,0
"Mom was the only one visiting her , and even then she had to travel to another state .",0
I don’t want my mom to feel so sad and hopeless .,0
But I’m the youngest of 5 kids —,0
I’ve never been the one leading the pack .,0
I’m the one who always goes another way and goes against the grain .,0
Right now though I just feel frozen .,0
Like we’re all just waiting for something bad or serious enough to happen to force someone to make a stand and take control .,0
"If you got this far , thank you for reading .",0
I’m not even sure if I made sense or asked a clear question .,0
I guess I just need to know what my options are ; what are the resources I can use that I’m not aware of ; has anyone else heard of a situation like this ?,0
Thanks so much for any advice y’all can offer .,0
I can’t imagine a worse time ( in my life ) for this Covid stuff : it was so bad at first when everyone had to stay away .,0
"But her emotional health became too fragile and we finally had to realize she’ll die from loneliness if she doesn’t die of Covid , so now my sisters come more regularly and wear masks , try to stay in the backyard , etc .",0
"To all of you caregivers out there who’ve been forced to stay away because of this pandemic , I feel your pain .",0
This was so hard already — we really didn’t need or deserve to have this virus totally screw this situation up any more than it already is .,0
Love to all y’all .,0
And thanks again .,0
My grandma therefore used to drive to his place every evening to setup the TV so that my uncle can watch his favorite TV shows .,0
"I built a small setup ( app , server software , ir - sender ) so that my grandma can setup the TV remotely from her place .",0
"It works pretty well and it was interesting to see how my grandma , who never used smartphones or computers before , had no big issues with using the app .",0
However I also just built an Alexa skill to make it even easier for her .,0
Let 's see how that works out .,0
Here is a video of the app in action :,0
https://photos.app.goo.gl / QETKDqob1R31ZP5u6,0
"If anyone is looking for a solution like that or something similar , I would be very interested in hearing from you .",0
Help her watch tv,0
My mother has dementia and can’t work the television .  ,0
"Usually my dad is around and can help her find something to watch , but he does all of the errands",0
so he is sometimes out .  ,0
She panics when he is out and it would help her a lot if she could watch tv and relax a bit .  ,0
She doesn’t watch tv often,0
and she ’s,0
"quite old - fashioned , so",0
she doesn’t like much of what ’s on .  ,0
My husband is incredibly patient and has created a very detailed sheet of instructions for her .  ,0
"At this point she should be able to turn it off and on , check specific channels that he wrote down the number for , and sometimes channel surf .  ",0
"This is a real struggle , but as long as we review it with her often , she can do it .  ",0
"However , most of the time she can’t find something to watch .  ",0
She can’t use the guide .  ,0
"Because the shows she likes aren’t usually on when she tries , she thinks the tv is broken and quickly gives up .  ",0
I can’t believe there is nothing to help with this .  ,0
We have them on our Netflix account and my dad uses it to watch shows with her when he ’s around,0
"( she loves Hallmark Christmas movies and he watches one with her every single night ) , but she definitely can’t use it herself .  ",0
I would love for her to be able to use it because then there would always be something she could watch at any time of day .  ,0
I just feel like there has to be a way to do this .,0
Is there any program that can be used to help a senior with pretty severe dementia watch tv ?,0
Is there any smart wristband out there in the market ?,0
Any recommendations ?,0
Mom w/ early dementia victim of romance scam,0
We just moved my septuagenerian mom in with us from across the country .,0
"She has some form of early dementia , though she is not a fan of "" too many psychological questions "" from her doctor , so any full diagnosis is going to take some time .",0
( We are in the building rapport stage with her new doctor . ),0
"I have been taking care of all of her life stuff that she let fall at the wayside , including figuring out her finances .",0
"I have known that she was involved with an internet scammer for a couple of years , but honestly could not stop her .",0
After she gave him some money and bought some gift cards we convinced her ( I think ) to stop giving them money .,0
"I have access to her phone , and they are in constant contact and have recently been asking for more money .",0
"In addition , I think this person might have gotten way more money , as my mom 's retirement is empty .",0
"She didn't have that much money in there and was never planning on really using it for retirement , but still .",0
"I have not been able to track down exactly where the money went , but it 's definitely possible that it went to these scammers .",0
It is time for this to end .,0
We are planning on reporting the scammer to the FBI .,0
I various details to share with them .,0
I am just not sure what to do regarding my mother .,0
She sees this person as her love .,0
And she is very defensive anytime,0
I mention them .,0
She had a fairly loveless marriage and has been pretty lonely since my father died a couple of decades ago .,0
I am worried that they will just find her again .,0
"She is only so good at being sneaky , but I am still worried .",0
"I am also obviously worried that they will steal more money from her , though I have access to her bank accounts and pretty much know what 's going on .",0
She has been a bit depressed since moving here .,0
"She was not being very COVID careful , and",0
so on top of moving here away,0
she is missing social time .,0
I do not think she will just stop talking to this person because we ask .,0
I am worried that if we tell her we need to block them that I'll send her into an even deeper depression .,0
The dementia aspect of this is new to us and has also been overwhelming .,0
"I have been putting off this task , but I could really use some advice .",0
Seeking At Home One Patient Caregiver Appl,0
Hi Caregivers !,0
I hope y’all,0
all are having a great day .,0
"Also , thank you for all that you do .",0
"It ’s hard work with little thanks , but know that you are appreciated .",0
My husband is the “ House Manager ” and caregiver for a close family friend who has MD .,0
Our family friend is fortunate that he is able to afford 24/7 at home private care .,0
We have also just hired two other people to assist with care .,0
The issue we are encountering is a lack of communication between all of us .,0
"I’ve done some research and tried some caregiver tracking apps ( CareZare , CareZone , CareCore , Carely , Care Angle & Capella Care ) , but haven’t found anything to meet our needs exactly .",0
"CareZare is exactly what we need , but it ’s not well developed nor reliable .",0
"The rest of the apps had some key points of needs , but ultimately missed the bar .",0
I was wondering if y’all had any suggestions or could refer an app .,0
"We would prefer to use an app vs paper log , just to streamline things .",0
Anything is appreciated !,0
Thank you for your help in advance,0
&,0
I hope you have a wonderful day !,0
"Can we start a list of "" smart "" devices for the home to help one parent care for the other with dementia ?",0
"My parents ( one with dementia ) are determined to stay in their home , and the addition of smart devices may help them do so safely .  ",0
I was hoping we could start a specific list ( i.e. links to devices ) of smart home devices to help make their lives easier .  ,0
the caretaker parent is fairly tech savvy .  ,0
Any ideas or previous experiences are welcome !,0
For any caregivers / redditors that take multiple medications a day,0
/ Redditors worried about elderly parents,0
Howdy !,0
I have been making an excel spreadsheet for my 88y grandma for the last few years .,0
"It lists all of her daily medications , details , check boxes to mark times",0
she 's taken etc .,0
It 's divided by month and by day .,0
"Each page includes the day of the week , date , etc .",0
It 's also made to print,0
so you could keep it in a binder or whatever .,0
You can just edit the medications to whatever your needs are .,0
I'll send it over to anyone who 's interested free of course !,0
Let me know,0

"My grandpa ( 93 ) is hoping to continue living in his house as long as possible , and I'm helping my family brainstorm things that could help keep him as safe as possible there .",0
Has anyone tried anything like this ?,0
"When I googled it , it seems like most fitness trackers are geared towards people who are very comfortable using touchscreens , but I was thinking he could maybe use Siri to sync the data",0
and then a family member ( either in person or remotely ) could keep an eye on the numbers to know if he might need an extra check - in .,0
Any advice would be great !,0
Tech to help with dementia,0

Not exactly a tech question,0

Thanks for any help !,0

What are the pros and cons of hiring someone ( probably a stranger ) to serve as a remote assistant to a senior citizen with memory loss ?,0
My mother is elderly ( over 80 ) and has started to have short - term memory loss .,0
"It 's gotten more noticeable in the last 6 months or so , and she has started to acknowledge it .",0
"My brother and I both live at a distance from her , though he is close enough that he can make the round - trip in a day , and he visits every few weeks .",0
"She is not home - bound , she drives well , and is very intelligent .",0
We do not think she is any danger to herself .,0
"Due to the pandemic , she is alone a lot of the time , especially now that it is winter",0
and she can't easily have visitors outside in the yard .,0
"Friends and relatives phone her often -- one of them daily , several multiple times a week .",0
She has local friends who bring her groceries weekly .,0
"She is also able to run to the grocery store herself , where she is cautious about going very early and making the trip short .",0
"However , she is not great about remembering to wash her hands , remove her mask properly , etc .",0
She needs help with computer and iPhone issues fairly regularly .,0
She 's always been tech challenged,0
"but it is more critical now , with phone and Zoom being the main ways of interacting with people during the pandemic .",0
She reaches out to my brother a lot for tech help ( and to me occasionally on it ) .,0
She reaches out to me on financial questions fairly regularly and sometimes on medical .,0
My brother and I both observed her memory issues getting worse .,0
I began pursuing trying to get a diagnosis and any medical help that seems appropriate .,0
"She was able to get a Zoom appointment with her family doctor , who seemed excellent .",0
"( I attended , too . )",0
He prescribed comprehensive blood testing .,0
Everything was normal .,0
He has referred her to a neurologist .,0
That will be next -- she would prefer to wait until after she 's vaccinated .,0
I made sure she registered for the vaccine as soon as she became eligible .,0
He would like to hire someone overseas ( inexpensive ) .,0
My mother is not eager to have a remote assistant .,0
She thinks that will just be someone to supervise and have to try to share everything with electronically .,0
"Her biggest source of frustration is technology , and second is trying to get things done where she has to depend on other people being reliable and doing the job well .",0
She has a lot of trouble scanning documents or emailing photos of things .,0
I asked my brother if the reason he wants a remote assistant is because her questions are becoming burdensome to him .,0
He said no,0
but I think he has backed away from that answer .,0
"My husband , who works in IT and is super patient , has offered to help her with computer issues .",0
"She is happy to have that resource and thinks the world of my husband , but she hasn't reached out to him yet .",0
I think she is used to contacting my brother,0
and I don't think he has discouraged her from doing so .,0
Here 's why I'm posting : I am concerned about the safety of a stranger knowing that she lives alone and has memory issues .,0
"That person would know when she has an appointment and is out of the house and could also potentially try to scam her in other ways , such as financially .",0
"( At this point , my mother controls her own finances , though she is gradually bringing me in to help . )",0
"When my brother first suggested the remote assistant , I raised my safety concerns with him .",0
"I also suggested that if we do hire someone , we should set the cost aside .",0
We both know that she is well off and cost is not an issue for her -- she is happy to pay well for work for her .,0
I have said we should put safety first and hire someone one of us knows and trusts,0
( I gave him 3 names of underemployed friends who might be interested ) or perhaps a friend of a friend who is well - vetted .,0
My brother 's position is that anyone can rip you off whether you know them or not .,0
I subsequently also offered to help more ( which I am doing ) and I have offered my husband 's help with the technology issues ( which my brother has not responded to --,0
instead he 's emailing me things like medical releases we should give a   remote assistant ) . ,0
Sorry this post is so long .,0
"I would love any advice on any of the following : whether I'm being overly concerned about my mother 's safety , approaches to dealing with my brother on this assuming that I'm not being overly concerned , possible alternative ways to address my mother 's issues , any stories of success or failure using remote assistants , and anything I might be missing .",0
Thank you in advance !,0
My dad has very recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer 's .,0
He is 63 and has never had any health issues before this so has never had to take regular medication .,0
My mum passed away 6 years ago,0
so he lives alone,0
and unfortunately I live an hour away .,0
He is struggling to remember to take medication .,0
Any solutions ?,0
He 's now changed medication and has to take one pill morning and evening which is now an issue as he doesn't remember the evening one .,0
He won't accept outside help yet as he 's literally only been diagnosed for 3 months and has barely even told his friends yet .,0
Also are there any groups or places you go to chat about your situation ?,0
I think I would like someone to chat to about it all as its happened all of a sudden,0
and it 's a lot to take in .,0
Thanks for any replied and apologies for the long post .,0
Son living away from father with congestive heart failure,0
Can you recommend a good app / tool / system for   helping a person with congestive heart failure monitor their symptoms on an ongoing basis and for a caregiver to monitor their progress ?,0
"For context : my father , 67 , recently experienced heart failure that doctors say was brought on by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ( read : no blockages or cholesterol problems ) .",0
"His cardiologist instructed him to monitor his weight , fluid and sodium intake daily .",0
"He 's done a great job of tracking so far , but he 's using pen and paper which I fear he could lose .",0
"Using pen and paper also makes it difficult for his doctors , my family and I to monitor and support him in his efforts from afar .",0
"This Sunday , I'll be leaving my dad ( he lives on the East Coast , U.S. ) to return to the West Coast ( U.S. ) , where I   live .",0
"Before then , I to make sure we have a dependable system in place and figure someone here might have gone through something similar and has advice to offer .",0
"Some more details about everything below , but if any more information would be helpful please please ask Sorry this got so long ...",0
"Thus far , it seems diet and weight tracking apps are best suited to accommodate the workflows we're after .",0
"And of the   apps we've looked at , MyFitnessPal and LoseIt !",0
"are top for they both allow for weight , fluid and sodium intake logging .",0
"However , they feel quite bloated and neither allow you to include fluids in your primary goal tracking dashboard among other things .",0
Someone I care about had a fall recently .,0
I am very worried about him as they,0
couldn't,0
pinpoint what it was .,0
I heard about GreatCalls being around $ 15 a month after buying the device for a Keychain .,0
Are there any of you that have experience and could share with this or similar products ?,0
He will likely never use it,0
but what if he did ?,0
Seems like a small amount of money for someone I care about .,0
What options are there for care of disabled person who needs 24/7 care and you can’t afford a paid caregiver ?,0
I am at the brink .,0
Background : DH ( 58 ) became disabled 16 years ago due to surgery to remove a brain tumor .,0
"Bleed on his brain during surgery causing paralysis of left arm and leg , and subsequent seizures caused permanent short term memory loss .",0
Also has severe chronic pain Walks with a quad cane .,0
Has urinary incontinence so wears pull - ups .,0
Over the years he got worse,0
and I needed help,0
so 5 years ago we moved from the west coast to Midwest where he has family .,0
"We lived with his mom who , it turned out , wanted to be the “ good / fun person ” and I remained the “ bad one ” tending to all his issues .",0
"I thought it would be better there , but it wasn’t .",0
"He has been in physical , occupational and cognitive therapy numerous times but always quits .",0
We went back to California earlier this year to stay with my mom for a while .,0
A couple months ago he fell and broke his hip .,0
Hospital stay then inpatient rehab .,0
I am not joking when I say he can not be left alone for A MINUTE !,0
He thinks he ’s fine,0
and the second you are gone he’ll get up .,0
A couple days ago I he was getting dressed,0
and I told him to not get up until I got back from the kitchen .,0
I left the room with the baby monitor and he gets up fast and falls .,0
Another trip to the ER – luckily no damage .,0
I should have learned my lesson because today he tried to get up again while I was out of the room .,0
I was literally screaming for him to sit back down while I ran back to him .,0
I don’t know what to do .,0
I literally need to be by his side 24/7,0
but it ’s not realistic .,0
We can’t afford a caregiver and he refuses to be safe ( thinks he ’s strong / overestimates his current capabilities ) .,0
I’m not working right now but his decisions to be unsafe are driving me over the edge .,0
We can’t afford for me not to work much longer .,0
Our only income is his social security and it is just enough to make us ineligible for Medicaid .,0
I am seriously about to lose my mind .,0
I am getting maybe 3 hours of sleep every night because the noise he makes using a urinal in bed wakes me up every 1 - 1.5 hours like clockwork .,0
So back to my question posed in the title .,0
He needs 24/7 care right now,0
"and I can not sustain this level of effort by myself , but we are broke .",0
Are there resources I’m not aware of ?,0
It ’s both cute and sad . 🤷,0
"Hello , First time posting here . ",0
My dad is 81 and has light / moderate dementia .  ,0
"He is okay as far as long term memories , and still knows me , my brother and my mom , who all live with him .  ",0
"He can take care of himself with most things and is fairly independent as far as showering , using the restroom , etc .",0
"Though he doesn't cook for himself , drive , etc .",0
We live in safe neighborhood with minimal traffic and our street goes in a loop .  ,0
My dad often gets bored and goes on walks .  ,0
Our house has 6 sliding doors and a front door,0
so he will leave without us noticing or sometimes he will be in the backyard,0
and then he will decide to go on a walk .,0
"We aren't necessarily worried about him getting lost as of now , however , the issue is he never lets us know that he is going for a walk .",0
"We know as his condition worsens , this will be more of an issue .  ",0
Locking all the doors or constant monitoring will likely be what we need to do down the line ..,0
"But for now , we just want a way to be notified when he leaves the house",0
"so we can know when he left and stop him if needed , accompany him , etc . ",0
He has a Verizon Care Smart watch,0
https://www.verizon.com/connected-smartwatches/verizon-care-smart/?cmp=KNC-C-HQ-PRO-R-BP-NONE-NONE-2K0PX0-PX-GAW-71700000073797633&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2af-BRDzARIsAIVQUOeGEAjXP4WZpkNzzOSvHv7Zbi9Yy6y8NiuCMC8Q-tVrCtcENIU00HcaAtKwEALw_wcB,0
But it really doesn't do a good job of sending notices .,0
"More over , even though Verizon is by far the best cellular network for where we live , on a device this small the signal is very weak and drops out often . ",0
Anyone have any suggestions or thoughts on these products ?,0
https://projectlifesaver.org/locating-technology/pli-pr1-perimeter/ https://www.alzstore.com/gps-tracker-watch-elderly-p/0950.htm,0
One more note,0
: I realize there a some tracking devices that are not watches but still wearable .  ,0
"Unfortunately , anything that isn't wristband or watch is unlikely to stay on him .  ",0
"Especially if he wakes up early , dresses himself and leaves the house . Thank You",0
My family is preparing to bring a family member home after he had stroke in March .,0
"He ’s been at a SNF the past 2 months getting therapy , etc .",0
I’ve seen separate devices for both of these,0
"but I’m wondering if there ’s one solution , preferably with an alert on my phone",0
so I don’t have to carry around extra alert devices around .,0
I’d,0
love to hear what people have used for the same needs .,0
Thank you !,0
He insists he is fine(he is not ),0
so preferably something he can not leave at home or forget .,0
"At first i thought to attach it to his key chain , but he will be losing his license in 2 weeks most likely .",0
Any ideas ?,0
Why aren’t there more / better technology options ?,0
"My mil has had short term memory loss , basically she can’t make new memories it seems .",0
It doesn’t seem to be progressing fast and she is self sufficient-,0
she can take care of her self well because it ’s all automatic .,0
My mom is recently widowed and is nearly 80 .  ,0
Any suggestions or types or service plans to consider ?  ,0
Thanks .,0
She doesn’t have a cell phone ...,0
I wondered if an Alexa or google home might work ?,0
I know zero about these systems ... or is “ life alert ” the answer ?,0
"Many thanks , and good luck out there !",0

Looking for advice on caring for elderly grandparents and medication management,0
"Hello everyone , brief background ...",0
I am currently taking care of my elderly grandparents after my grandma took a bad fall and was hospitalized for a few weeks .,0
"Before her incident , she was almost fully independent and the main caregiver for my grandfather and managed his type 2 diabetes .",0
"Since her accident and upon returning home , her memory seems to have been really impacted and she 's no longer able to remind my grandfather to test his blood sugar and take his insulin before every meal , let alone remember to take her meds now too .  ",0
"My family and I are looking for ways / options to allow them to be independent again because at the moment , we are there nearly 14 hours a day",0
and it 's really taking a toll on us .,0
I’ve found the “ Sentry ” product online,0
but it seems too easy to get around by pressing 0 and then calling back .,0
There ’s no reason for my mom to pick up a call from an unknown caller at this point .,0
Any ideas ?,0
Any recommendations ?,0

Would love any advice .,0
Thanks in advance .,0

Remotely controlled electronics,0
Hi everyone ! !,0
Cross my fingers this gets seen 🤞,0

Just a little bit of info about me : my mom was diagnosed with early - onset dementia -  ,0
she ’s 58 .,0
I recently moved out but still visit her every weekend .,0
She lives at home with her mother and my godmother goes to her house a few   times a week,0
so she ’s never alone .,0
"She still likes to do things for herself like cooking , cleaning , and laundry but still needs occasional help .",0
Where she really struggles is using electronic devices .  ,0
I’ve started to teach her how to use her Samsung tablet so she can   listen to music even when I’m not there to help her navigate the tablet .  ,0
Any suggestions and alternate solutions are appreciated !,0

Any Reminder Software ?,0
So I struggle with mental illness and my biggest problem is short to long term memory gaps .,0
"Daily things , I skip .",0
"This means things like eating , hygiene , etc .",0
I'm curious if anyone here knows of a program or software which I can use with my phone and computer linked together to remind me constantly when a thing needs to be done .,0
And will only stop reminding me if I maybe check that it 's done by marking it down in the program .,0
"If this is the wrong place to put this I'm sorry , but I don't know where else to go for this .",0
And I know that a phone and computer both have calendar reminders,0

Question RE :,0
Elder Care Alert Buttons,0
Is there something like that ?,0
An awesome helpful device to keep track of your loved one from afar,0
Get your loved one the device from angel sense.com ( no spaces ),0
"I’m not being sponsored or paid for this , I just want to share this with this community because I know I would be happy if someone told me about it .",0
So my dad has early onset,0
"Alzheimer ’s , my brothers and I live nearby but we work and so does my mom , full time .",0
My dad stays home and mostly watches tv,0
but sometimes he goes on a walk around the block .,0
The problem is he doesn’t think to bring his wallet or phone with him ... ever ...,0
so he fell last week on his walk and thankfully a neighbor ( who didn’t know who he or my family was ) called an ambulance for him and got him to the ER .,0
He has a couple bumps and bruises,0
and it was a tough day for all of us .,0
That day made us realize the absolute necessity of him having ID on him and a way for us to keep an eye on him .,0
We got the Angel sense device two days ago and it ’s been a god send .,0
The device was free but,0
there ’s a monthly charge if you want the walkie talkie portion of it .,0
It attaches to any clothing ( the only downside here is if your loved one lives alone this might be more difficult if they don’t know how to put it on or take it odd ) and only a special key can remove it .,0
It ’s small ( like a security tag,0
you,0
d find on your clothes when buying them ) and is super light weight .,0
It needs to charge and also needs to be put near a window for a couple hours so the GPS can get its bearings .,0
It gives us so much more peace of mind,0
and I hope it’ll help anyone of you too .,0
Car GPS for tracking person with Dementia,0
I'll try to keep this short :,0
"My grandmother has dementia , but she also enjoys her independence .",0
The family tries what it can to allow her to do what she loves while keeping track of her whereabouts .,0
"My grandmother still drives to places , but she mainly goes to church and grocery shopping , but can get lost if her normal route is blocked ( road closures ) .",0
All other destinations she will have someone else with her .,0
We would like to have someway to track her car in case she gets lost .,0

Canadians : best medic alert / fall prevention device ?,0
Apologies,0
"if this has been posted , I am having a hard time finding any real person reviews on these devices :(",0
"I am comparing brands such as Bay Alarm Medical , Medical Guardian , and MobileHelp .",0
They all basically charge $ 20 - 30 for basic at home services where the user can press a button on her bracelet or necklace to call for help .,0
I am unable to really understand if these companies are reputable .,0
They seem more interested in making sales .,0
I am looking to make my grandma safer .,0

Best GPS tracker,0
Which GPS trackers have people on here had experience with .,0

Hi there !,0
I am very new to this sub .,0
We are about a 3 years into my father in law 's diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer 's .,0
"While we absolutely love the time we spend with him , things are extremely difficult .",0
He is at the stage where he is still lucid enough to understand that he is confused ...,0
if that makes sense .,0
So really it comes down to frequent arguing and paranoia .,0
"It is difficult to determine if he is confused , or if he just wants to hid things from us .",0
"Currently , we are struggling with electronics .",0
He lives in an independent living facility-,0
so basically the only thing they assist with is housekeeping and meals .,0
"He very much enjoys having his phone and apple watch , and is able to understand facebook , etc .",0
The problem is he is continually changing his passwords .,0
"He changes his apple account , facebook , phone login , email login ... EVERYTHING ... almost daily .  ",0
"He then calls us to see if we can help him because "" facebook is broken "" or "" something is wrong with Apple "" , when really he just keeps changing things .",0
"I don't know if this is Dementia , paranoia , or what ?",0
We very much cherish our time with him and we 100 % want to maintain his independence as long as possible .,0
I am just curious how others have handled similar struggles ?,0
"Do we just let him keep changing things because it is "" his "" phone ?",0
We spend hours on the phone with him trying to walk him through steps of how to change things back .,0
"Apple is also frustrating because once he changes his apple account , it logs him out of all of his other",0
devices-,0
so he has to repeat the process with everything .,0
He is under my brother in law 's plan right now,0
so we could have access if we needed .,0
We are just unsure of the right move !,0
How do you handle their paranoia ?,0
We are frustrated and could really use any words of wisdom and guidance .,0
Thank you so much !,0
"Hello , my father in law has Alzheimer 's and things have reached a point where my mother in lawdd has asked for my help in finding a watch for him to wear .",0
I've done some research and ordered one device from Amazon that turned out to only work on 2 G mobile networks which AT&T has deactivated .,0
I'd rather not get something that is an expensive wearable that is geared more toward active people and is too focused on counting steps and heart rate and such .,0
Has anyone here had experience with this or recently bought one that they ended up really liking ?,0
"Extra features like being able to call the watch or listen in on it remotely through the app would be nice , but aren't a must .",0
The one I already ordered and had to send back because it wouldn't work on the cell network,0
( it was 2 G ),0
was this one : https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GRZQ6SK/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_C1wDDbSJP80V7,0

Logging land - line phone calls,0
My friend 's parents are aging and dealing with some memory issues and poorer judgment than before .  ,0
"As a result , they have previously been scammed by those tech support people that call and insist they're from Microsoft .  ",0
"I went ahead and removed admin capabilities from their PC , but that 's not going to protect their wallets .  ",0
It 's my opinion that their phone is perhaps one of the most dangerous things in their house .,0
"They are still living independently , and phone calls are an important part of their social interactions , so I would like to find a solution that doesn't interfere with their calls from friends .  ",0
"The parents do have a modem on their computer , so a software option should be straightforward .  ",0
"I may end up programming something on my own , but I don't have a land line to test with easily .",0

GPS tracker recommendations,0
Hi all .,0
I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a service or product that could work .,0
"Ideally , it’d be something with multiple tags , like it’d work on his phone and on some sort of pendant / keychain ?",0
"It also has to be fairly easy to use , she ’s not great with tech or English and they're in Hawaii and we're in the mainland US",0
so I can't help with the setup .,0
I’ve done some looking but there are so damned many things and services that just look like scams or a way to separate desperate people from their money I’m at a loss .,0
And just randomly anything else we can get or set up to help them ?,0
Any help would be appreciated .,0
A family member of mine has early dementia and has a lot of trouble keeping track of the day .,0
He ’s still able to work and function but something that hinders this,0
is he has trouble keeping track of the day .,0
Every day we call him to make sure he knows to go to work,0
and we have short arguments about the day .,0
A calendar is too confusing to him .,0
Even checking off the boxes is too big of a task .,0
I’m thinking of developing an LED calendar that shows,0
today ’s date and doesn’t have any room for interpretation .,0
He needs very simple instructions like :,0
“ Today ’s date is Sunday November 29th .,0
You work at 11 AM,0
It is currently 9 AM ”,0
"He should be able to press a button to see tomorrow as well , so he knows what time he has to wake up if he has to work .",0
Thoughts ?,0
This may need to have two versions .,0
One audible and one text .,0
He has trouble reading sometimes .,0
Grandfather wanders off frequently .,0
Hello everyone .,0
The problem is he is really clumsy and probably throw them away or hide it when nobody is around .,0
I wanted to know know if anyone has faced similar situation or knows about a product that will be hard for him to get rid off .,0
I would appreciate any suggestions that you guys might have .,0
It really hurts seeing him lost a part of himself every day .,0
There are moments when he does not even recognize familiar faces .,0
We're using a corded landline ( she tends to lose cordless phones and cell phones ),0
but this has the downside of the line being off the hook,0
( she eventually puts it back on ) .,0
We had an idea to find an automatically answering speakerphone ( that would basically function as an intercom ),0
but I can't seem to find anything like this on the internet .,0
Has anybody dealt with this problem before or found similar solutions ?,0
Has anyone found a fitness tracker that doesn't use a smartphone ?,0
She doesn't have a smart phone but does have wifi .,0
I would need something that I could look at the stats when I'm not there .,0
Any suggestions ?,0

"Hi , My dad fell down a couple weeks back and was diagnosed with brain bleed .",0
He had to have two small holes drilled in his skull to drain the blood .,0
The doctors say he needs 24/7 monitoring and someone always in the house to make sure he doesn't fall down again .,0
I don't need this to be connected to a cellular network or call out to an ambulance .,0
I just need something dependable that works locally in the house .,0
I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the different devices online and I'm wondering what you guys would recommend .,0
Thanks .,0

Alexa for my Dad for Music and Safety,0
My 80 year old dad wanted a way to listen his CDs .  ,0
And I was thinking of ways to set up something like Life Alert .  ,0
Alexa to the rescue .  ,0
I’ve been showing him how to play all kinds of music and he seems to enjoy it .,0
One device covers 90 % of his house but I will probably get him one for the bathroom as well .  ,0
"And best of all , no monthly monitoring fee .",0
Got mom a Great Calls phone ...,0
I purchased my mom a flip phone to replace her 2nd broken smartphone .,0
She wrecks charge ports and this new phone has a charge base .,0
"The problem is , this phone has an emergency services button on the bottom for ...",0
"you guessed it , emergency situations .",0
Today was moms first full day with the phone and in 4 hours she has called the line at least 11 times .,0
I say at least because those are just the ones she has hung up on,0
and they call me to verify that she 's okay .,0
It seems like a great service .  ,0
They are fast and friendly .,0
"But , how do I prevent this from happening all day ?",0
Any tips ?,0
Thanks,0
I looked it up on Google,0
and it looks like there are lots of services that you can buy a wearable GPS tracker that uses mobile data and pay a monthly fee,0
and you can track people no problem !,0
"Unfortunately my father will not wear any of these items ( necklace , bracelet , he won't even wear his medic alert bracelet , I've literally put it on him , begging him to keep it for his own safety and he just gives me a dirty look and removes it ) and even the sneaky shoe sole trackers are a no go because he wears flip flops anytime the weather allows it .",0
"However he always has his phone on him , and he even keeps it charged !",0
"Yay , I was hoping that since he already has a device that can be tracked that the phone company would offer a service for GPS tracking , but apparently they do nt ( why not ?",0
"Other companies are using the exact same tech and charging $ 60 / month , why wouldn't the phone company want to get in on that ? ) .",0
So I suppose I'm stuck using a GPS tracking app installed on the phone,0
", so I figured I'd see if anyone else here has anything to say ( good or bad ) about apps or services that they've used .",0
I'm happy to pay as long as it 's going to get the job done .,0

(which he already has.)  he was given haldol, another antipsychotic, in hospital recently -  and that was a nightmare, had tons of hallucinations and delusions, which is unusual for him.  seroquel could make him drowsy - if hes out walking and falls, his condition would be worse...  im inclined to not get this drug for him, and my so and mom (his ex wife) agree... thoughts?"

making the move,hi folks.
making the move,i'm really struggling with what to do next and would love to hear from you all.
making the move,when did you find it was the right time to move your loved one to full time care?
making the move,"i feel dragged back in to the dysfunction and abuse to manage her care, but have been diligent with liaising with all of her doctors, and doing my best to ensure she's getting the best care possible, implementing solutions like hiring housecleaning, homecare visits several times a week, getting pillpack, etc."
making the move,"i'm really worried she's only speeding her decline as she has very little social life and basically only interacts with her boyfriend (himself a 77 year old who does not seem to grasp the concept of this disease and how she might look the same but she is not capable of making decisions, etc.)."
making the move,i have notes from 2 of her doctors right now (neuro and endocrinology) that state she is not capable of making decisions for herself and should move to assisted living.
making the move,i guess i'm just looking to learn from you all how you executed a move for your loved one.
making the move,i've toured 7 or so of memory care communities and the representatives always tell me that nobody wants to move or thinks it's their time to move.
making the move,thanks for reading and thanks for your help.

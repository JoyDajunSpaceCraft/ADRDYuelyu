updates to my last post	i wanted to give a bit of an update.	care transition
updates to my last post	incontinence started earlier than my predictions, with the first recorded instance happening last night.	care transition
updates to my last post	i don't know if it was a full-blown accident, as it seems more like she didn't follow bathroom hygiene for a while and maybe it built up to the point of being visible?	care transition
updates to my last post	i don't know, and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.	care transition
updates to my last post	mil was walking around and had a large spot on the back of her pants that i pointed out to bf.	care transition
updates to my last post	he tried to talk to her about it, but it ended up with her denying and him losing his patience.	care transition
updates to my last post	she eventually took a bath and we swapped out the pants.	care transition
updates to my last post	bf was exhausted and he's been in shock pretty much all night.	care transition
updates to my last post	he doesn't want to believe that this is happening and wants to believe this is a one-off and that she still has another 6+ months before having to worry about continence issues.	care transition
updates to my last post	bf is poa, and is feeling overwhelmed, saying he didn't realize that poa meant doing so much.	care transition
updates to my last post	i think last night was a huge eye-opener as even he realizes that fighting with his mom every day to change her underwear is a lot.	care transition
updates to my last post	he's been really sad about this latest step, understandably so.	care transition
updates to my last post	i've tried bringing him to the sub, but he says he's not ready for all that, although he appreciates it when i read some of your posts and helpful responses out loud for him.	care transition
updates to my last post	we talked it over for a while, and he messaged his sister and we're having a small family meeting tonight after work.	care transition
updates to my last post	according to him, she hasn't been telling him all the awful details that have been happening when she takes mil out once a week.	care transition
updates to my last post	i'm not sure about this, because sil and i have talked about it multiple times.	care transition
updates to my last post	he says he was doubting both of our stories because he didn't see it, it hasn't happened to him, and that we were alone when it was happening.	care transition
updates to my last post	i pointed out that he's the one in the family that's famous for having a temper and also that he is a man and his mother has been getting increasingly sexist in the last year or so and that may be affecting the way she addresses him.	care transition
updates to my last post	we also talked about our approaches to care.	care transition
updates to my last post	he admitted that he had been feeling like i was being a wicked witch and a bit of a dictator with trying to establish care.	care transition
updates to my last post	he also said i was being mean to his mom.	care transition
updates to my last post	i asked for clarification and explained that i keep my tone neutral and use easy to understand words when i'm asking her to do something because any other tone elicits an outburst from her as she really doesn't like authority, or me for that matter.	care transition
updates to my last post	he did acknowledge that i've never yelled at her, or sworn at her, or anything like that and that he didn't know that was why i was keeping voice low and that maybe he had misinterpreted what i was doing.	care transition
updates to my last post	bf apologized to me for being mean to me when he's realizing that me being  'cold & clinical ' is simply trying to talk to him about where we are in the process and how to make his mother's quality of life better.	care transition
updates to my last post	he has been a bit frazzled and has never really had a routine, so it's been a constant struggle establishing one.	care transition
updates to my last post	for instance, last night, dinner wasn't even on the table until 11pm!	care transition
updates to my last post	granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the place schedule-wise.	care transition
updates to my last post	i sat down with him last night and wrote out a schedule of care that she would be expected to get if she was in a hospital, or a nursing home.	care transition
updates to my last post	i told him i was willing to help as long as we could argue that the quality of her life with us would be higher than she would be getting in a home.	care transition
updates to my last post	i also wrote down a list of symptoms to bring up on their next dr visit in february.	care transition
updates to my last post	i'm hoping that after tonight's meeting, we can really start in earnest to find placement for mil, or at least some sort of respite.	care transition

dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	he started taking seroquel at 25mg in june, then we had to increase to 50mg in september-ish after assaulted some caregivers and became agitated to the point of requiring restraints while in the hospital, and now...his symptoms have been getting steadily worse over the past two weeks or so.	psychosocial
dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	we've been living with him for a few months.	psychosocial
dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	friday night after getting his 50mg dose in the evening, around 4am he started pounding on our bedroom door, yelling and screaming, and attacked me - hit me (though not very effectively) with a metal basket, deeply scratched/gouged my arm with his nails, and left a few bruises.	psychosocial
dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	when he got up the next morning i was sure to give him 25mg with breakfast to try to keep him calm throughout the day as it seems like he's been waking up with hallucinations and paranoia, vs. his usual sundowning.	psychosocial
dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	he was still agitated and threatening by that afternoon and we had to give him 75mg in the evening to get him to calm down.	psychosocial
dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	this morning i had to hide his 25mg seroquel in his cereal because he was so suspicious and paranoid of me.	psychosocial
dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	&#x200b; i had already talked to his care team about increasing his dosage the morning before he attacked me.	psychosocial
dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	i was thinking he needed to go to the extended release version but now i'm wondering if he needs something more heavy hitting entirely.	psychosocial
dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	&#x200b; i am planning to attend a caregiver support group either tuesday or thursday, possibly both, depending on when i can meet with his care team.	psychosocial
dad with alz is getting increasingly psychotic	i am still shaken up from the friday night incident.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	ughhhh, i'm just very angry about the whole thing.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i've been fighting with my bf for a while now about getting his mother onto a waitlist for a nursing home knowing that it'll be about 2 years before she gets placed.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	he has refused to and is now saying she doesn't have the low-income insurance that she needs to get onto the waitlist.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i'm frustrated because he isn't doing anything to get his mom the proper care that she needs and it's going to get way worse before it gets better.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and the bedrooms and the bathroom is on the second floor.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	she's gained a lot of weight in the last year and is having trouble getting off the couch and the stairs are making her tired.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i don't think she has much time left before she is unable to navigate them.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	she is also complaining of problems with her bowels constantly, of having diarrhea, which i suspect is her articulating that she is getting close to losing continence.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	bf is convinced that isn't the case and that it's simply her diet.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	she is also getting increasingly aggressive.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	she is irritable and angry with both me and my bf's sister.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	she yells, swears and threatens violence.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	she also hurls a lot of racist statements my way (i'm asian).	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	his sister and i are on the same page regarding her care and needs and it's frustrating that bf can't see it that way.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	his biggest problem is that he doesn't want her to feel afraid and that's why he's resistant to her going anywhere.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i understand his fear, but i feel that she is going to be afraid regardless and that it would be better to get her acclimated to a new environment sooner so that she has a chance to recognize her surroundings.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i worked as a nursing assistant to get through school and it's been really frustrating.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i've worked in nursing homes and they're not as bad as people make them out to be.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	yes, they're not home, i get it, but they're not jails.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i've been trying to help him navigate the waters but he's been resistant to any help.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	when she was first placed on her meds, i mentioned that she should be on an antidepressant because of her behavior and to help her sleep.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	he eventually decided to take her off of it without telling anybody because he felt that i was too pill-happy and trying to overmedicate her.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	that led to a solid 2 months of her crying constantly, being angry with everybody and just having a really rough time before he realized that she really needed the meds.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i'm worried that she's going to need assistance toileting, and bathing soon and she won't let him help because he's a boy, and she's violent towards me.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	it's unrealistic to expect his sister to drive over constantly to help because mil is violent towards her as well.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i feel like he is setting us up for failure because by the time she really really needs help, we won't be able to get help when we need it.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	he told me yesterday that he'd rather the two of them move into a studio apartment and he can just deal with her so that she can die in her own bed.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i'm really tempted to let him do it, but that would be a catastrophe, he has a very low patience threshold, constantly loses his temper, and isn't able to give any sort of structure to her life.	psychosocial
super frustrated with this whole process	i'm just feeling like i'm watching a very slow-moving trainwreck and i'm tied to the rails.	psychosocial

just placed my dad in memory care today	hello to everyone.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	i just found this reddit and i just felt the need to post.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	about six months ago, my 80 year old father was diagnosed with alzheimer's.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	we had noticed that he was forgetting when he was, and more importantly, this man who always balanced his checkbook to the penny had suddenly racked up tons of debt and had collectors calling him.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	shortly after the diagnosis, he was mostly ago, until about two months ago.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	he started falling constantly, wanted to go  'home ' (where this home was, we never knew) and was hallucinating people.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	it turns out he developed a uti on top of this, which made matters worse.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	they thankfully were able to clear that up, but it seems that the uti made him progress faster than any of us expected.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	we thought maybe we could do assisted living, but it turned out he needed more care than that.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	so after a lot of talk and discussion, we made the choice to place him in memory care faculty.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	today was his move in day, and after spending about two months in an absolutely horrible wreck of a nursing care facility, he seemed much happier in the new place.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	he has his own room now and lots of people he can interact with.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	i know we made the right decision as no-one in the family could give him the proper care he needed, but i'm still a wreck.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	i know i shouldn't feel this way, but i feel horribly guilty about having to place him there.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	i have no idea why i'm having these feelings.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	i also am a wreck just knowing that he's slowly going to slip away and one day, he's just going to be a shell, i guess placing him there just kinda of confirmed it for me.	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	is this normal?	psychosocial
just placed my dad in memory care today	has anyone else gone through this?	psychosocial

making the move	hi folks.	care transition
making the move	i'm really struggling with what to do next and would love to hear from you all.	care transition
making the move	this community has brought me a lot of comfort the past few months although this is my first post.	care transition
making the move	my mom's alzheimer's diagnosis was made aware to me early in 2019, and i have been watching her slowly decline further the past 6 months or so.	care transition
making the move	i'm an only child who lives out of state (bout a 2 hour plane ride from her) and am her poa for medical and health, and trustee of her trust, so all decisions go to me.	care transition
making the move	when did you find it was the right time to move your loved one to full time care?	care transition
making the move	i am not willing to become a full time care giver to my mom.	care transition
making the move	we did not have a good relationship before her diagnosis and i have basically spent my adult life trying to recover from childhood trauma.	care transition
making the move	i feel dragged back in to the dysfunction and abuse to manage her care, but have been diligent with liaising with all of her doctors, and doing my best to ensure she's getting the best care possible, implementing solutions like hiring housecleaning, homecare visits several times a week, getting pillpack, etc.	care transition
making the move	she's getting worse and worse and conversations are just cyclical like the same 30 seconds on repeat.	care transition
making the move	she sits at home and watches tv, although recently she has even taken to just sitting, without even watching tv.	care transition
making the move	i'm really worried she's only speeding her decline as she has very little social life and basically only interacts with her boyfriend (himself a 77 year old who does not seem to grasp the concept of this disease and how she might look the same but she is not capable of making decisions, etc.).	care transition
making the move	i have notes from 2 of her doctors right now (neuro and endocrinology) that state she is not capable of making decisions for herself and should move to assisted living.	care transition
making the move	she refuses to accept this, and keeps telling me it's 10 years too soon to move.	care transition
making the move	obviously, i will take her doctors' advice over her own opinion but i just don't know how to execute the move.	care transition
making the move	if you talk to her she says that she's  'completely fine ' and has no health issues (she has multiple issues in addition to alzheimer's).	care transition
making the move	i guess i'm just looking to learn from you all how you executed a move for your loved one.	care transition
making the move	i've toured 7 or so of memory care communities and the representatives always tell me that nobody wants to move or thinks it's their time to move.	care transition
making the move	how did you do it and how did your loved one respond?	care transition
making the move	i personally think that social engagement will be really good for her, but am struggling knowing she will be very upset, and that i will likely have to separate her from her dog, who she loves very much.	care transition
making the move	thanks for reading and thanks for your help.	care transition

handling a big move -- venting, worrying	my mother, 82, was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's, though has been showing increasing memory problems for several years and has been on a steeper downhill slide the last four months.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	she's currently living in the  'independent living ' area in an excellent retirement community where the residents and staff know her and care about her.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	later this week we are moving her to a new facility where she will be in assisted living, with memory care available when she needs it.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i'm her son, 64, and i am her agent under her power of attorney, which was authorized by the written opinion of her doctor.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	my mom has a very controlling personality.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	for the most part, she has used her powers for good, planning carefully for her future.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	she has long term care insurance and enough money in her investments to last her for many, many years.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	but now, of course, she's resisting my taking control of her finances (she has forgotten many times to pay bills, her rent, etc) and is absolutely against moving.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	her current facility has been doing what they can within their legal power (we are in washington, where there are strict laws governing what the differences are between independent and assisted living) to keep her safe while we find new housing, but there is really no choice now that we have a new home for her.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	she has to move.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	we've talked about it many times over the past few weeks.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	as expected, every conversation about her moving is the same conversation, because she can't remember what we've talked about in the past.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	she continually surprised by the fact that she can't stay where she is (they can't provide the level of care she needs).	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	she asks over and over about the new rent, and where the money is coming from, why she has to move when she's happy where she is.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	her arguments and questions are always the same.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	it's almost like a script, and have no idea how to get ahead of it, if i even can.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i tell her over and over -- sometimes several times in the same conversation -- where the money is coming from, that it's hers, and it's being used exclusively for her (though, to be honest, i've been a co-signer on her bank accounts for over a decade, long before dementia was an issue for her...so i could legally use it for anything i want, but morally...no, it's hers).	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	as much as i am able i keep my patience, answer her questions and explain the circumstances as if it's the first time i'm hearing her questions and giving her the answers.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i dread the next week, as we pack and move, and the weeks after as she gets used to her new home (or doesn't, as the case may be).	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i love my mom, and i hate having to defy her.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i'm afraid of her taking a walk in the next few days and getting lost, as she has a couple times lately (not seriously lost...not yet).	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	since she's in independent living at the moment, the staff can't legally stop her from leaving.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	but i'm afraid she'll get it into her head to walk away as a deliberate act against the control i've had to take over her life.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	or she could write me a letter revoking the power of attorney, which is one of the provisions of the poa.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i doubt she'll remember she can do that (though i've reminded her of it a couple of times), or won't be able to think through the decision and the act to do it.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	and if somehow she does, with the new lease having been signed and move-out notices given, i have no idea what i would need to do next.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i know this is probably an old story.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	everyone's alzheimer's journey is different, they tell me, but the broad strokes are much the same.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	and i know in my head what i'm doing is right for her.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	but she also makes me doubt it.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i'm a pretty empathetic person, but i have a hard time empathizing with her, seeing things through her eyes, because her memory problems are foreign to me, especially since she's been so logical and thought so correctly for my whole life.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i wish i could feel i'm doing things right.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	i know i'm doing the best i can.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	no one among her friends or family is opposing my decisions except my mom, but i'm also the only one making decisions.	psychosocial
handling a big move -- venting, worrying	so i had to vent.	psychosocial

update to mil hair care	it's been tough because she's in a stage i've been calling the  'negative nellies '.	resource
update to mil hair care	nothing is going right and there is an opposite response to everything we say.	resource
update to mil hair care	i never start the conversation about the hair, i've been waiting for her to come to us, which she'll do multiple times to complain about her hair.	resource
update to mil hair care	so i offer to comb it and style it, and then she'll get super angry that we're even touching it.	resource
update to mil hair care	she's still very capable of independent adls, except for combing her own hair and that's less about her dexterity and more about not being in the mood for it.	resource
update to mil hair care	i was talking about it with a friend who mentioned that one of those trendy  'undercuts ' may work because we could cut the knot out close to her skull, and then the rest of her hair would cover the patch and she may not notice.	resource
update to mil hair care	i think that will be our next move if this knot still won't move.	resource
update to mil hair care	i'm not really looking forward to it because i know it's going to make her very angry in the moment, but it may help with the knots moving forward.	resource

terrified of getting dementia	hi all,  i'm 42 years old with a wife and two kids, smart and college educated, but terrified of getting alzheimer's.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	my parents are 70 and don't have any signs, and i don't actually know anyone close to me who has had it, but it's literally the worst thing that could happen to me.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	last year after i turned 41, i was talking with my wife and she was incensed that i didn't remember even talking about some topic she said we had talked about a few months prior.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	and then i started thinking about how i sometimes miss our exit when we're driving together because i'm not paying attention.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	and how i'm always misplacing things.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	and i had just gotten a fitbit and it showed that i only get like 38 minutes of deep sleep a night.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	and back when our first child was born 10 years earlier, we did the attachment parenting thing and during the week my wife asked me to get up when our daughter cried, which then progressed to me basically rocking her all night long and me getting practically zero sleep for about 7 months, and i'm worried i did permanent damage to my brain... anyway i made an appointment with a doctor for early onset dementia even though i know i sounded crazy.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	she gave me a ridiculously simple test which was obviously not designed for early cases, and had an mri run--of course they found my brain was perfectly healthy.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	i do everything else i can think of to keep my brain healthy--exercise, my diet is great, fish oil, coq10 etc.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	except nothing i've tried has improved my deep sleep... so i've had adhd all my life, i was diagnosed as an adult, i probably have some anxiety, and i know that i've always misplaced things or my mind has wandered during conversations... so the rational part of me knows this, but then i'm just always looking for signs that i'm getting worse.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	it's like i'm a hypochondriac for alzheimer's.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	the other day i was at the gym and a song came on, and i was upset that i couldn't remember who it was by.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	it was on the tip of my tongue.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	i've heard it many times, and the group is one of my wife's favorites.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	i was thinking about it the rest of my workout and on the drive home, and then later that night i finally remembered it--florence and the machine.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	but this tip of my tongue episode really bothered me... maybe this is a midlife crisis, but do people grow out of them and get used to the fact that you're getting older?	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	i've also decided that i'm not going to go out with a disease like this.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	that means that if i'm ever diagnosed with dementia that i'll probably have a small window of opportunity to take action before i'll be too confused to do anything about it.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	and i hate contemplating things like this--like should i go buy a gun now and take lessons just so i have it when the time comes...   but i'm just wondering are there others here who are freaked out about getting this too?	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	maybe people who know it runs in your family?	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	how do you deal with that?	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	the thing is, i may be a hypochondriac now, but the risk keeps going up the older i get.	psychosocial
terrified of getting dementia	if i make it to 85, there's a 50% chance that i'd be right....	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	just spoke to my dad (66) on the phone.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	he had forgotten that we actually talked recently, just about 2 weeks ago if that, which wasnt encouraging.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	he said he has a cat scan on monday and will know more at that point, but its possible hes in the early stages of alzheimers.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	this isnt all that surprising to me, we dont talk very frequently but ive definitely had to explain a few things to him multiple times - things that are pretty major, like the fact that im still in college.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	im 26 and i live on the other side of the country.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	he has a long-term girlfriend and they live together but arent married.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	i worry about the implications of a long and difficult illness on the horizon.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	i dont have the resources to care for a parent - i have a ton of debt and, unfortunately, decided to pursue a degree that doesnt leave you with a lot of stable employment options upon graduation.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	im planning on going to graduate school in a couple of years, after which id be able to teach, but thats so far out that who knows what his situation will look like by then.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	i guess im just feeling guilty and uncertain.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	i have so much of my own life to figure out still.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	my dad and i have had a rocky relationship at times over the years - he and my mom divorced when i was 9. frankly, sometimes he can be an insufferable jerk, but at the same time i still value his support and input when i get it because, well, hes my dad.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	i feel like i owe him something, in a way, even if its just trying to maintain a healthier relationship while we still can because thats really all i have to give.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	please excuse me, there wasnt really a major point to all this.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	im just wondering if anybody has some advice to share.	psychosocial
facing the possibility of my dad having alzheimers	my parents were 36 and 40 when they had me, and i dont really feel prepared to approach this situation at this point in my life.	psychosocial
